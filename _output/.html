		<td class="en">Chapter I Introuduction</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >圣约翰说：“上帝就是爱。”我最初想写这本书时，曾经以为可以依托这句格言而十分顺利地完成全部的写作计划。我曾以为我能说，人类的各种爱只要与上帝代表的爱是相似的，就能称之为爱。因此，首先我要把我所说的赠予之爱和需求之爱区分开来。最典型的赠予之爱能促使人们努力工作，制定计划，积累钱财，只为家人未来的幸福，虽然到那时自己既无法目睹也分享不到那种幸福。而最典型的需求之爱是将孤独或受到惊吓的孩子送回到母亲的怀抱的那种爱。</td>
		<td class="en">“God is love,” says St. John. When I first tried to write this book I thought that his maxim would provide me with a very plain highroad through the whole subject. I thought I should be able to say that human loves deserved to be called loves at all just in so far as they resembled that Love which is God. The first distinction I made was therefore between what I called Gift-love and Need-love. The typical example of Gift-love would be that love which moves a man to work and plan and save for the future well-being of his family which he will die without sharing or seeing; of the second, that which sends a lonely or frightened child to its mother’s arms.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >哪一种更像上帝之爱是毫无疑问的。上帝之爱是赠予之爱。圣父把其全部和其所有统统都给予了圣子。圣子把自己交还给圣父，把自己交还给世界，而且他是为了世界，把自己交还给圣父，因此把（自身之中的）世界也交还给了圣父。</td>
		<td class="en">There was no doubt which was more like Love Himself. Divine Love is Gift-love. The Father gives all He is and has to the Son. The Son gives Himself back to the Father, and gives Himself to the world, and for the world to the Father, and thus gives the world (in Himself) back to the Father too.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而从另一方面讲，我们认为上帝的生活中最不该有的东西就是需求之爱了吧？上帝什么东西都不缺，但我们的需求之爱却像柏拉图所说的“贫穷之子”。这是我们的真实本性在意识上的切实反映。我们生来是无助的。一旦我们充分意识到这一点，孤独感就会随之而来。我们在肉体、情感和思想上都需要他人；若我们想有所认识，哪怕是认识我们自己，都需要与他人交流。</td>
		<td class="en">And what, on the other hand, can be less like anything we believe of God’s life than Need-love? He lacks nothing, but our Need-love, as Plato saw, is “the son of Poverty.” It is the accurate reflection in consciousness of our actual nature. We are born helpless. As soon as we are fully conscious we discover loneliness. We need others physically, emotionally, intellectually; we need them if we are to know anything, even ourselves.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我曾经期待着这本书可以简单地歌颂第一种爱，贬损第二种爱。现在看来，许多当时我想要写的似乎仍然是正确的。我依然认为，如果我们所说的爱仅仅代表着一种对被爱的渴望，那我们就落入了一种很可悲的境地。但是，（与我的导师麦克唐纳不同）现在我并不认为，如果仅把爱理解为渴望被爱，就是把绝非是爱的东西错当成了爱。我不能否认*爱*这个词也指需求之爱。每次我试图沿着这样的思路作深入的思考时，最终得到的都是迷惑和矛盾。现实比我想象的复杂多了。</td>
		<td class="en">I was looking forward to writing some fairly easy panegyrics on the first sort of love and disparagements of the second. And much of what I was going to say still seems to me to be true. I still think that if all we mean by our love is a craving to be loved, we are in a very deplorable state. But I would not now say (with my master, MacDonald) that if we mean only this craving we are mistaking for love something that is not love at all. I cannot now deny the name *love* to Need-love. Every time I have tried to think the thing out along those lines I have ended in puzzles and contradictions. The reality is more complicated than I supposed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >首先，如果我们不把需求之爱称为“爱”，那么我们就篡改了包括母语在内的大多数语言。当然，语言不是绝对可靠的指导准则，不过，它虽有缺点，但也积淀了大量的真知灼见和经验。要是你一开始就不尊重语言，语言自有办法让你今后尝到苦头。我们最好不要像汉普蒂·邓普蒂那样任意胡乱地使用词语。</td>
		<td class="en">First of all, we do violence to most languages, including our own, if we do not call Need-love “love.” Of course language is not an infallible guide, but it contains, with all its defects, a good deal of stored insight and experience. If you begin by flouting it, it has a way of avenging itself later on. We had better not follow Humpty Dumpty in making words mean whatever we please.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >其次，如果把需求之爱称为“纯粹的自私”，我们就得小心自己的用词了。*纯粹*，一贯是个危险的字眼。毫无疑问，正如我们所有的冲动一样，需求之爱也可以被自私地放纵。专横而贪婪地寻求爱是可怕的，但是在日常生活中，没人会认为孩子跑到母亲那里寻求安慰是自私的举动，也不会认为大人从同伴中“找个伴儿”是自私的的行为。无论大人还是小孩，那些很少这样做的人并不一定就是最无私的。但凡感受到了需求之爱，我们就有了拒绝或是彻底克制它的理由，而感受不到这种爱通常是冷酷的自我主义的标志。既然在现实中我们都需要彼此（“人独居不好”），那么这种需求未能在意识上表现为需求之爱——换句话说，也就是那种认为独居*是*好事的虚幻感觉——就是一种不健康的精神症状，就像食欲不振是医学上的不健康症状一样，因为人确实是需要食物的。</td>
		<td class="en">Secondly, we must be cautious about calling Need-love “mere selfishness.” *Mere* is always a dangerous word. No doubt Need-love, like all our impulses, can be selfishly indulged. A tyrannous and gluttonous demand for affection can be a horrible thing. But in ordinary life no one calls a child selfish because it turns for comfort to its mother; nor an adult who turns to his fellow “for company.” Those, whether children or adults, who do so least are not usually the most selfless. Where Need-love is felt there may be reasons for denying or totally mortifying it; but not to feel it is in general the mark of the cold egoist. Since we do in reality need one another (“it is not good for man to be alone”), then the failure of this need to appear as Need-love in consciousness—in other words, the illusory feeling that it *is* good for us to be alone—is a bad spiritual symptom; just as lack of appetite is a bad medical symptom because men do really need food.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第三，我们来谈一些更为重要的东西。所有基督徒都同意，人的精神健康状况与其对上帝的爱是完全成正比的。但是，从其本质上讲，人对上帝的爱必定在很大程度上总是一种需求之爱，并且常常完全就是一种需求之爱。这在祈求宽恕我们犯下的罪过或者从苦难中寻求援助时尤为明显。但是从长远看，随着我们逐渐认识到——认识必定是不断提高的——我们全部的存在实质上是一种巨大的需求，这种认识可能会更加明显；这是对上帝发出的不完整的、试探性的、空虚却又混乱的呼求，因为上帝能够将纠缠在一起的东西解开来，也能将零散的东西串联起来。我并不是说人除了纯粹的需求之爱以外，就不可能再带给上帝任何其他的东西。崇高的灵魂或许会告诉我们超出需求之爱的境界。但我认为这些灵魂也会第一个告诉我们，一旦人们胆敢认为自己可以生活在那种境界中，并从此以后抛弃了需求的成分，那么那种境界便不再会是真正的恩典，而将变成新柏拉图主义的幻想，甚至最终沦为邪恶的幻想。《效法基督》指出，"没有最低者也就无所谓最高者"。只有狂妄和愚蠢的受造之物才会在造物主面前自夸"我决不向你讨要什么，我无私地爱着你"。人们要是对上帝表现出近乎赠予之爱的爱，那么他们必将很快，甚至当时，就会与那个税吏一起捶胸，向唯一真正的给予者诉说他们的贫乏。上帝也会这样安排的。对于我们的需求之爱，上帝这样说："凡劳苦担重的人，可以到我这里来。"或者如《旧约》中所说，"你要大大张口，我就给你充满"。</td>
		<td class="en">But thirdly, we come to something far more important. Every Christian would agree that a man’s spiritual health is exactly proportional to his love for God. But man’s love for God, from the very nature of the case, must always be very largely, and must often be entirely, a Need-love. This is obvious when we implore forgiveness for our sins or support in our tribulations. But in the long run it is perhaps even more apparent in our growing—for it ought to be growing—awareness that our whole being by its very nature is one vast need; incomplete, preparatory, empty yet cluttered, crying out for Him who can untie things that are now knotted together and tie up things that are still dangling loose. I do not say that man can never bring to God anything at all but sheer Need-love. Exalted souls may tell us of a reach beyond that. But they would also, I think, be the first to tell us that those heights would cease to be true Graces, would become Neo-Platonic or finally diabolical illusions, the moment a man dared to think that he could live on them and henceforth drop out the element of need. “The highest,” says the *imitation*, “does not stand without the lowest.” It would be a bold and silly creature that came before its Creator with the boast “I’m no beggar. I love you disinterestedly.” Those who come nearest to a Gift-love for God will next moment, even at the very same moment, be beating their breasts with the publican and laying their indigence before the only real Giver. And God will have it so. He addresses our Need-love: “Come unto me all ye that travail and are heavy-laden,” or, in the Old Testament, “Open your mouth wide and I will fill it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因此，最伟大的需求之爱要么是与人最高尚、最健康以及最现实的精神状态相吻合，要么至少是其主要组成部分。这就出现了一种非常奇怪的推论：人从某种意义上看最不像上帝的时候就是最接近上帝的时候。还有什么会比富足与贫乏、君权与谦卑、正义与悔过、无限的力量与求助的呼喊更互不相像呢？第一次想到这个悖论时，我大为震惊，也因此打消了想要写书讨论爱的所有念头。我们面对这个悖论，似乎就只能产生这样的结果。</td>
		<td class="en">Thus one Need-love, the greatest of all, either coincides with or at least makes a main ingredient in man’s highest, healthiest, and most realistic spiritual condition. A very strange corollary follows. Man approaches God most nearly when he is in one sense least like God. For what can be more unlike than fullness and need, sovereignty and humility, righteousness and penitence, limitless power and a cry for help? This paradox staggered me when I first ran into it; it also wrecked all my previous attempts to write about love. When we face it, something like this seems to result. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们必须区分两种可能被称为"接近上帝"的情况。第一种是与上帝的相似性。我认为上帝早已在其创造的万物中体现了与其自身的某种相似性。空间和时间以各自的形式印证了上帝的伟大，所有生命证明了上帝的多产，动物的生命反映了上帝的活力。人类由于有了理性而具有比上述种种更重要的相似性。我们认为天使具有人类所没有的相似性：永生不死和直觉知识。从这个角度讲，所有人（不论好人坏人）、所有的天使（包括那些堕落天使）都要比动物更像上帝。从这个意义上讲，他们的本性更“接近”神性。而第二种我们可以称为趋向的接近。如果这是我们想要表达的一个人“最接近”上帝的状态，就是当他最为确定且最快速地使自己与上帝融合、接近上帝的视野和沐浴上帝荣光的状态。我们一旦把相似之接近和趋向之接近区分开来，就会明白二者未必吻合，可能是一致的，也可能是不一致的。</td>
		<td class="en">We must distinguish two things which might both possibly be called “nearness to God.” One is likeness to God. God has impressed some sort of likeness to Himself, I suppose, in all that He has made. Space and time, in their own fashion, mirror His greatness; all life, His fecundity; animal life, His activity. Man has a more important likeness than these by being rational. Angels, we believe, have likenesses which Man lacks: immortality and intuitive knowledge. In that way all men, whether good or bad, all angels including those that fell, are more like God than the animals are. Their natures are in this sense “nearer” to the Divine Nature. But, secondly, there is what we may call nearness of approach. If this is what we mean, the states in which a man is “nearest” to God are those in which he is most surely and swiftly approaching his final union with God, vision of God and enjoyment of God. And as soon as we distinguish nearness-by-likeness and nearness-of-approach, we see that they do not necessarily coincide. They may or may not.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >或许打个比方会有助于理解吧。假设我们走在山路上，山那边的村庄是我们的家园。中午我们到了一个悬崖顶上，从空间上讲，我们离村子非常近，因为村子就在悬崖下面。我们可以随手丢块石头下去，但是我们不能像攀岩高手那样顺岩而下，只能绕路；或许有五英里吧。从静态的角度讲，我们在所绕的路上的许多个地方都比在悬崖上坐着时离村子更远，但这仅仅是就静态而言的。用发展的眼光看，我们离家越来越“近”了，就快要能泡澡、喝到茶水了。</td>
		<td class="en">Perhaps an analogy may help. Let us suppose that we are doing a mountain walk to the village which is our home. At mid-day we come to the top of a cliff where we are, in space, very near it because it is just below us. We could drop a stone into it. But as we are no cragsmen we can’t get down. We must go a long way round; five miles, maybe. At many points during that *détour* we shall, statically, be farther from the village than we were when we sat above the cliff. But only statically. In terms of progress we shall be far “nearer” our baths and teas. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因为上帝是神圣的、全能的、有统治力和创造力的，因此很明显从某种意义上说，无论幸福、力量、自由和能产性（思想上的或身体上的）出现在人生的何处，都构成了与上帝的相似性，并且以这种方式建立起了与上帝的接近。但没有人认为自己所拥有的这些禀赋与我们的神圣化有必然关联。没有一种财富是通往天堂的通行证。</td>
		<td class="en">Since God is blessed, omnipotent, sovereign and creative, there is obviously a sense in which happiness, strength, freedom and fertility (whether of mind or body), wherever they appear in human life, constitute likenesses, and in that way proximities, to God. But no one supposes that the possession of these gifts has any necessary connection with our sanctification. No kind of riches is a passport to the Kingdom of Heaven. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在悬崖顶上时，我们离村子很近，但不管在那里坐多久，我们都不会离淋浴和茶水更近一些。这里的道理也是一样的，与上帝的相似性以及从某种意义上讲的与上帝的接近，是上帝赋予特定生灵及其特定状态的，而且这个过程早已结束，并已经根植于万物之中了。由相似带来的与上帝的接近永远不会仅仅因为相似性本身而变得再近一些。但是由趋向性带来的与上帝的接近，根据其定义，是可以更加接近上帝的。相似性是赐给我们的——无论我们是否心怀感激，无论它是否得到了恰当的利用。而趋向性，不管上帝的恩典开始如何引导，如何支撑，都需要我们做点什么。所有生物通过不同方式被创造出来，反映了上帝的各种样子。这个过程无需他们的参与，甚至也不管他们是否乐意。他们并非因此而成为上帝之子。他们通过成为上帝之子而获得的相似性，不是形象或长相上的相似性。从某个方面讲，这远超出了相似性，因为这是与上帝意志的融合或统一；然而这与我们一直思考的所有差异是一致的。因此，正如一位优秀作家所说，现世中我们对上帝的效法必然是对上帝化身的效法。这出自我们的自愿，并且不同于上帝加诸我们本性或各个阶段的任何相似性。我们的榜样是耶稣，不仅是钉在十字架上受难的耶稣，也是工作中的、大街上的、人群中的耶稣，还有面对喧嚷的召唤和粗暴的反对的耶稣、失去了安宁和隐私的耶稣、忙于应对各种阻挠和干扰的耶稣。以上种种是如此奇异，完全不像与上帝本身有什么联系，而它已经很明显不仅像，而且就是人类生活条件下的上帝的生活。</td>
		<td class="en">At the cliffs top we are near the village, but however long we sit there we shall never be any nearer to our bath and our tea. So here; the likeness, and in that sense nearness, to Himself which God has conferred upon certain creatures and certain states of those creatures is something finished, built in. What is near Him by likeness is never, by that fact alone, going to be any nearer. But nearness of approach is, by definition, increasing nearness. And whereas the likeness is given to us—and can be received with or without thanks, can be used or abused—the approach, however initiated and supported by Grace, is something we must do. Creatures are made in their varying ways images of God without their own collaboration or even consent. It is not so that they become sons of God. And the likeness they receive by sonship is not that of images or portraits. It is in one way more than likeness, for it is union or unity with God in will; but this is consistent with all the differences we have been considering. Hence, as a better writer has said, our imitation of God in this life—that is, our willed imitation as distinct from any of the likenesses which He has impressed upon our natures or states—must be an imitation of God incarnate: our model is the Jesus, not only of Calvary, but of the workshop, the roads, the crowds, the clamorous demands and surly oppositions, the lack of all peace and privacy, the interruptions. For this, so strangely unlike anything we can attribute to the Divine life in itself, is apparently not only like, but is, the Divine life operating under human conditions. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我现在必须解释一下，为什么我认为这个区别对于所要讨论的爱是必要的。我脑海里一直在比较圣约翰所说的“上帝就是爱”和一位现代作家（Ｍ·丹尼斯·德·鲁日蒙）所说的“只有爱不会变成神时，爱才不会沦为魔鬼”；后一种观点当然也可以换个说法：“爱一旦成了神，就会沦为魔鬼。”对于我来说，这种比较起到了不可或缺的预防作用。要是忽略了这种比较，“上帝就是爱”这一真理可能会被我们偷偷地倒过来，变成了“爱就是上帝”。</td>
		<td class="en">I must now explain why I have found this distinction necessary to any treatment of our loves. St. John’s saying that God is love has long been balanced in my mind against the remark of a modern author (M. Denis de Rougemont) “love ceases to be a demon only when he ceases to be a god”; which of course can be re-stated in the form “begins to be a demon the moment he begins to be a god.” This balance seems to me an indispensable safeguard. If we ignore it the truth that God is love may slyly come to mean for us the converse, that love is God. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我认为，所有想过这个问题的人都明白M·德·鲁日蒙的意思。每种人类之爱在处于最佳境界时往往都会有一种趋向，宣称其具有某种神的权威。它的声音听起来像是上帝本身的意愿。它告诉我们不要计较得失，要全心地投入。它还试图凌驾于其他一切主张之上，并且暗指任何“以爱之名”而做出的虔诚行为都因此是合法的，甚至是值得称赞的。情爱和对国家的爱会因此试图“神化自身”，大家对此都是很清楚的。不过，亲人之爱也会神化自身，朋友之爱可能也会如此，只是方式不同罢了。此处先不赘述，因为我会在下面的章节中反复谈到这一问题。</td>
		<td class="en">I suppose that everyone who has thought about the matter will see what M. de Rougemont meant. Every human love, at its height, has a tendency to claim for itself a divine authority. Its voice tends to sound as if it were the will of God Himself. It tells us not to count the cost, it demands of us a total commitment, it attempts to over-ride all other claims and insinuates that any action which is sincerely done “for love’s sake” is thereby lawful and even meritorious. That erotic love and love of one’s country may thus attempt to “become gods” is generally recognised. But family affection may do the same. So, in a different way, may friendship. I shall not here elaborate the point, for it will meet us again and again in later chapters. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在必须注意的是，自然之爱提出这些亵渎神灵的主张时，并非是处于最差的自然状态，而是处在最崇高的自然状态，处于我们的父辈将其形容为“纯洁”或者“高贵”之时。这在情爱方面尤其明显。真诚的、真正具有自我牺牲精神的激情，会以一种似乎是上帝的声音向我们诉说，而纯粹的兽欲或轻佻的性欲却不会如此。这种性欲会用各种方式来腐蚀那些沉溺其中的人，但不会以借用上帝的方式；人们会对这些情感作出反应，但不会敬重这些情感，就如同挠痒的人不会敬重痒这种感觉一样。愚蠢的女人对娇惯的孩子的一时放纵实际上是一种自我放纵。当这种放纵一直持续时，孩子就变成了一个活生生的玩偶；这与（很大程度上）“为子而活”的妇女那种深厚而狭隘的奉献相比，这种放纵更不可能“神化”。我也倾向于认为，那种由啤酒和军乐队所激发出来的爱国之情是不会让人们为了祖国做出太大的坏事（也不会做出太大的好事）的。多喝一杯酒，与乐队齐鸣，这种爱国之情很可能就会消失得无影无踪了。</td>
		<td class="en">Now it must be noticed that the natural loves make this blasphemous claim not when they are in their worst, but when they are in their best, natural condition; when they are what our grandfathers called “pure” or “noble.” This is especially obvious in the erotic sphere. A faithful and genuinely self-sacrificing passion will speak to us with what seems the voice of God. Merely animal or frivolous lust will not. It will corrupt its addict in a dozen ways, but not in that way; a man may act upon such feelings but he can not revere them any more than a man who scratches reveres the itch. A silly woman’s temporary indulgence, which is really self-indulgence, to a spoiled child—her living doll while the fit lasts—is much less likely to “become a god” than the deep, narrow devotion of a woman who (quite really) “lives for her son.” And I am inclined to think that the sort of love for a man’s country which is worked up by beer and brass bands will not lead him to do much harm (or much good) for her sake. It will probably be fully discharged by ordering another drink and joining in the chorus.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当然，这应该在我们预料之中。我们所有的爱都不会宣称自己是神圣的，直到其宣称变得貌似有理。而在这些爱本身与上帝、与上帝之爱具有一种真正的相似性这种宣称是不会貌似有理的之前。大家这里可别误会了。我们所说的赠予之爱的确是与上帝相似的，并且在所有赠予之爱中，那些最无限的和不知疲倦的赠予是与上帝最相似的。诗人对赠予之爱的一切咏叹是千真万确的。赠予之爱所表现出的欢乐、活力、耐心、乐于宽恕、为其所爱谋求利益的渴望，所有这一切都是一种真正的和几乎迷人的上帝生命的形象。在这个形象面前，我们应当感谢“赐予人类这些力量”的上帝。实际上，说明白点，我们可以说那些爱得伟大的人是“接近”上帝的，但这当然是“相似之接近”，它本身不会产生“趋向之接近”。这种相似是早已赋予我们的，它与那种缓慢而痛苦的趋近之路是没有必然联系的，因为趋向是需要我们自己去完成的任务（虽然不会毫无援助）。然而，同时，相似性又那么光芒四射，我们才会把相似误认为相同。我们可能把只献给上帝的无条件的忠贞也赋予人类之爱中。这样一来，这些爱就变成了神，也沦为魔鬼。然后这些爱将会把我们毁灭，同时也毁灭自己，因为那些自然之爱在成为神之后便不再是爱了。它们仍然会被称为爱，但事实上却变成了恨的各种复杂形式。</td>
		<td class="en">And this of course is what we ought to expect. Our loves do not make their claim to divinity until the claim becomes plausible. It does not become plausible until there is in them a real resemblance to God, to Love Himself. Let us here make no mistake. Our Gift-loves are really God-like; and among our Gift-loves those are most God-like which are most boundless and unwearied in giving. All the things the poets say about them are true. Their joy, their energy, their patience, their readiness to forgive, their desire for the good of the beloved all this is a real and all but adorable image of the Divine life. In its presence we are right to thank God “who has given such power to men.” We may say, quite truly and in an intelligible sense, that those who love greatly are “near” to God. But of course it is “nearness by likeness.” It will not of itself produce “nearness of approach.” The likeness has been given us. It has no necessary connection with that slow and painful approach which must be our own (though by no means our unaided) task. Meanwhile, however, the likeness is a splendour. That is why we may mistake Like for Same. We may give our human loves the unconditional allegiance which we owe only to God. Then they become gods: then they become demons. Then they will destroy us, and also destroy themselves. For natural loves that are allowed to become gods do not remain loves. They are still called so, but can become in fact complicated forms of hatred. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们所说的需求之爱或许是贪婪而苛刻的，但这些爱不会以神灵自居。这些爱（从相似性上讲）不够接近上帝，也就不会有此奢求。</td>
		<td class="en">Our Need-loves may be greedy and exacting but they do not set up to be gods. They are not near enough (by likeness) to God to attempt that. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >由上可见，对于人类之爱，我们要避免成为盲目崇拜者，也要避免成为“批判者”。对情欲之爱以及“夫妇之爱”的盲目崇拜是十九世纪文学的一个通病。罗伯特·勃朗宁、查尔斯·金斯利以及考文垂·帕特莫尔的作品有时把坠入爱河等同于神圣化。这些作家习惯性地用家庭而非天国作为“尘世”的对照面。而我们的看法恰恰相反。那些批判者把父辈对爱的赞美之词都指责为无病呻吟和多愁善感。他们总是拔起自然之爱沾满泥巴的根茎，将其曝光于众。但我认为，我们不应该听信“聪明绝顶的人，也不应听信愚蠢至极的人”。没有最低者也就无所谓最高者。植物不仅需要上面的阳光，还需要下面的根茎，而根茎必定是沾满泥土的。只要把它留在花园中而不是撒在书桌上，那些泥土大都是干净的。人类之爱能够成为上帝之爱的光辉形象，不会达不到这一点，但也决不会有所超越。相似之接近有时会促进趋向之接近，有时也会阻碍趋向之接近。有时或许既不促进它也不阻碍它。</td>
		<td class="en">It follows from what has been said that we must join neither the idolaters nor the “debunkers” of human love. Idolatry both of erotic love and of “the domestic affections” was the great error of nineteenth-century literature. Browning, Kingsley, and Patmore sometimes talk as if they thought that falling in love was the same thing as sanctification; the novelists habitually oppose to “the World” not the Kingdom of Heaven but the home. We live in the reaction against this. The debunkers stigmatise as slush and sentimentality a very great deal of what their fathers said in praise of love. They are always pulling up and exposing the grubby roots of our natural loves. But I take it we must listen neither “to the over-wise nor to the over-foolish giant.” The highest does not stand without the lowest. A plant must have roots below as well as sunlight above and roots must be grubby. Much of the grubbiness is clean dirt if only you will leave it in the garden and not keep on sprinkling it over the library table. The human loves can be glorious images of Divine love. No less than that: but also no more—proximities of likeness which in one instance may help, and in another may hinder, proximity of approach. Sometimes perhaps they have not very much to do with it either way.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Most of my generations were reproved as children for saying that we “loved” strawberries, and some people take a pride in the fact that English has the two verbs *love* and *like* while French has to get on with *aimer* for both. But French has a good many other languages on its side. Indeed it very often has actual English usage on its side too. Nearly all speakers, however pedantic or however pious, talk every day about “loving” a food, a game, or a pursuit. And in fact there is a continuity between our elementary likings for things and our loves for people. Since “the highest does not stand without the lowest” we had better begin at the bottom, with mere likings; and since to “like” anything means to take some sort of pleasure in it, we must begin with pleasure. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人们早已发现，乐趣可以分成两大类：第一类是指那些除非有欲望在先，否则根本不会成为乐趣的乐趣；另一类是指本身就是而无需这种前提的乐趣。第一类乐趣可以以饮水为例。口渴了的时候，饮水会是一种乐趣，如果非常口渴的话，饮水会是极大的乐趣。不过，若非口渴或遵从医嘱，世上很可能不会有人仅仅为了享受这种乐趣而给自己倒水喝。第二类乐趣的例子，可以是一种出乎意料的香味——例如早上散步时，你闻到从豆田里或者香豌豆丛中飘出的阵阵芳香。在那之前，你一无所求，完全满足；而你得到的这种可能会很大的乐趣，是一件未经追寻、额外附加的礼物。为了表述清晰，我只举了些简单的例子，当然，还有许多复杂的情况。若你想要一杯水（并会因此得到满足），得到的却是咖啡或啤酒，那么你当然会得到第一种乐趣（缓解了口渴），但同时也得到了第二种乐趣（一种美味）。此外，有瘾的人会把本来的第二种乐趣转变为第一种乐趣。对有节制的人来说，偶尔喝杯酒是一种款待——就像豆田的香味一般。但是对酒鬼来说，他的味觉和消化能力早已被破坏，除了缓解他难以忍受的渴望之外，酒不能给他带来任何乐趣。只要还能辨认出丝毫味道，他就相当不喜欢它；但是这要比保持清醒带来的痛苦好多了。不过，通过所有的转换和组合，这两类乐趣之间的区别仍然是比较清楚的。我们可以把它们称为需求之乐和欣赏之乐。</td>
		<td class="en">Now it is a very old discovery that pleasures can be divided into two classes; those which would not be pleasures at all unless they were preceded by desire, and those which are pleasures in their own right and need no such preparation. An example of the first would be a drink of water. This is a pleasure if you are thirsty and a great one if you are very thirsty. But probably no one in the world, except in obedience to thirst or to a doctor’s orders, ever poured himself out a glass of water and drank it just for the fun of the thing. An example of the other class would be the unsought and unexpected pleasures of smell—the breath from a bean-field or a row of sweet-peas meeting you on your morning walk. You were in want of nothing, completely contented, before it; the pleasure, which may be very great, is an unsolicited, superadded gift. I am taking very simple instances for clarity’s sake, and of course there are many complications. If you are given coffee or beer where you expected (and would have been satisfied with) water, then of course you get a pleasure of the first kind (allaying of thirst) and one of the second (a nice taste) at the same time. Again, an addiction may turn what was once a pleasure of the second kind into one of the first. For the temperate man an occasional glass of wine is a treat—like the smell of the bean-field. But to the alcoholic, whose palate and digestion have long since been destroyed, no liquor gives any pleasure except that of relief from an unbearable craving. So far as he can still discern tastes at all, he rather dislikes it; but it is better than the misery of remaining sober. Yet through all their permutations and combinations the distinction between the two classes remains tolerably clear. We may call them Need-pleasures and Pleasures of Appreciation. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">The resemblance between these Need-pleasures and the “Need-loves” in my first chapter will occur to everyone. But there, you remember, I confessed that I had had to resist a tendency to disparage the Needloves or even to say they were not loves at all. Here, for most people, there may be an opposite inclination. It would be very easy to spread ourselves in laudation of the Need-pleasures and to frown upon those that are Appreciative: the one so natural (a word to conjure with), so necessary, so shielded from excess by their very naturalness, the other unnecessary and opening the door to every kind of luxury and vice. If we were short of matter on this theme we could turn on the tap by opening the works of the Stoics and it would run till we had a bathful. But throughout this inquiry we must be careful never to adopt prematurely a moral or evaluating attitude. The human mind is generally far more eager to praise and dispraise than to describe and define. It wants to make every distinction a distinction of value; hence those fatal critics who can never point out the differing quality of two poets without putting them in an order of preference as if they were candidates for a prize. We must do nothing of the sort about the pleasures. The reality is too complicated. We are already warned of this by the fact that Need-pleasure is the state in which Appreciative pleasures end up when they go bad (by addiction) . </td></tr>

They are not hated once we have had them, but they certainly “die on us” with extraordinary abruptness, and completely.

The smell of frying food is very different before and after breakfast.

		<td class="en">Pleasures of Appreciation are very different. They make us feel that something has not merely gratified our senses in fact but claimed our appreciation by right. The connoisseur does not merely enjoy his claret as he might enjoy warming his feet when they were cold. He feels that here is a wine that deserves his full attention; that justifies all the tradition and skill that have gone to its making and all the years of training that have made his own palate fit to judge it. There is even a glimmering of unselfishness in his attitude. He wants the wine to be preserved and kept in good condition, not entirely for his own sake. Even if he were on his death-bed and was never going to drink wine again, he would be horrified at the thought of this vintage being spilled or spoiled or even drunk by clods (like myself ) who can’t tell a good claret from a bad. And so with the man who passes the sweet-peas. He does not simply enjoy, he feels that this fragrance somehow deserves to be enjoyed. He would blame himself if he went past inattentive and undelighted. It would be blockish, insensitive. It would be a shame that so fine a thing should have been wasted on him. He will remember the delicious moment years hence. He will be sorry when he hears that the garden past which his walk led him that day has now been swallowed up by cinemas, garages, and the new by-pass. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >科学地讲，这两种乐趣毫无疑问都与我们的机体相关。但是需求之乐主要与人体结构及其当时的状况有关，除此之外，它对我们根本没有任何意义或吸引力。那些提供欣赏之乐的事物带给我们一种感觉——不论理智与否——即我们不管怎样都必须要品味它、留意它、赞扬它。“给刘易斯上这种酒是一种罪过。”红酒专家会说。我们也会问：“你怎么能路过这个花园而没有闻到那种香味呢？”但是我们永远不会对需求之乐有这样的想法：我们永远不会因为在不渴的时候路过水井没有喝水而自责或是责备他人。</td>
		<td class="en">Scientifically both sorts of pleasure are, no doubt, relative to our organisms. But the Need-pleasures loudly proclaim their relativity not only to the human frame but to its momentary condition, and outside that relation have no meaning or interest for us at all. The objects which afford pleasures of appreciation give us the feeling—whether irrational or not—that we somehow owe it to them to savour, to attend to and praise it. “It would be a sin to set a wine like that before Lewis,” says the expert in claret. “How can you walk past this garden taking no notice of the smell?” we ask. But we should never feel this about a Need -pleasure: never blame ourselves or others for not having been thirsty and therefore walking past a well without taking a drink of water. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >需求之乐是如何预示出我们的需求之爱的，这足够明显。在需求之爱中，我们从自身需求的角度来看所爱的人，正如口渴的人看水龙头或者酒鬼看一杯杜松子酒一样。需求之爱，像需求之乐一样，不会比需求本身持续得更久。幸运的是，这并不意味着所有起源于需求之爱的情感都会稍纵即逝。需求本身可能是永久的，或者是反复的。需求之爱中可能有另一种爱加入。道德规范（配偶的忠诚、子女的孝顺、感激之类的情感）可能会把这种关系维持一生一世。但是如果需求之爱没有援手，一旦需求不再，我们便几乎不能期待需求之爱不会“从我们身上消失”。这就是为什么世上总能听到母亲抱怨孩子长大以后就忽略了自己，也能听到被抛弃的情妇抱怨自己情人的爱纯粹是一种需求——她们仅仅是满足了这种需求而已。我们对上帝的需求之爱处于不同的地位，因为我们对上帝的需求在这个世界或任何其他世界上永远都不会结束。但是我们的需求意识会丧失，那时，需求之爱也会消失。“魔鬼病了，也会变成修士。”一旦摆脱了“危险、贫困或者灾难”，一些人的信仰就会慢慢消失，把他们短暂的虔诚描述成是虚伪的，这似乎没有什么道理。为什么他们就不该真诚呢？他们当时深感绝望，大喊救命。在这种情况下，谁会不真诚呢？</td>
		<td class="en">How the Need-pleasures foreshadow our Need-loves is obvious enough. In the latter the beloved is seen in relation to our own needs, just as the scullery tap is seen by the thirsty man or the glass of gin by the alcoholic. And the Need-love, like the Need-pleasure, will not last longer than the need. This does not, fortunately, mean that all affections which begin in Need-love are transitory. The need itself may be permanent or recurrent. Another kind of love may be grafted on the Need-love. Moral principles (conjugal fidelity, filial piety, gratitude, and the like) may preserve the relationship for a lifetime. But where Need-love is left unaided we can hardly expect it not to “die on us” once the need is no more. That is why the world rings with the complaints of mothers whose grown-up children neglect them and of forsaken mistresses whose lovers’ love was pure need—which they have satisfied. Our Need-love for God is in a different position because our need of Him can never end either in this world or in any other. But our awareness of it can, and then the Need-love dies too. “The Devil was sick, the Devil a monk would be.” There seems no reason for describing as hypocritical the short-lived piety of those whose religion fades away once they have emerged from “danger, necessity, or tribulation.” Why should they not have been sincere? They were desperate and they howled for help. Who wouldn’t? </td></tr>

		<td class="en">First of all, it is the starting point for our whole experience of beauty. It is impossible to draw a line below which such pleasures are “sensual” and above which they are “aesthetic.” The experiences of the expert in claret already contain elements of concentration, judgment, and disciplined perceptiveness, which are not sensual; those of the musician still contain elements which are. There is no frontier—there is seamless continuity—between the sensuous pleasure of garden smells and an enjoyment of the countryside (or “beauty”) as a whole, or even our enjoyment of the painters and poets who treat it. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">And, as we have seen, there is in these pleasures from the very beginning a shadow or dawn of, or an invitation to, disinterestedness. Of course in one way we can be disinterested or unselfish, and far more heroically so, about the Need-pleasures: it is a cup of water that the wounded Sidney sacrifices to the dying soldier. But that is not the sort of disinterestedness I now mean. Sidney loves his neighbor. But in the Appreciative pleasures, even at their lowest, and more and more as they grow up into the full appreciation of all beauty, we get something that we can hardly help calling *love* and hardly help calling *disinterested*, towards the object itself. It is the feeling which would make a man unwilling to deface a great picture even if he were the last man left alive and himself about to die; which makes us glad of unspoiled forests that we shall never see; which makes us anxious that the garden or bean-field should continue to exist. We do not merely like the things; we pronounce them, in a momentarily God-like sense, “very good.” </td></tr>

It has revealed to me a deficiency in our previous classification of the loves into those of Need and those of Gift. There is a third element in love, no less important than these, which is foreshadowed by our Appreciative pleasures. This judgment that the object is very good, this attention (almost homage) offered to it as a kind of debt, this wish that it should be and should continue being what it is even if we were never to enjoy it, can go out not only to things but to persons.

I mean here that love of nature which cannot be adequately classified simply as an instance of our love for beauty. Of course many natural objects—trees, flowers and animals—are beautiful. But the nature-lovers whom I have in mind are not very much concerned with individual beautiful objects of that sort. The man who is distracts them. An enthusiastic botanist is for them a dreadful companion on a ramble. He is always stopping to draw their attention to particulars. Nor are they looking for “views” or landscapes. Wordsworth, their spokesman, strongly deprecates this. It leads to “a comparison of scene with scene,” makes you “pamper” yourself with “meagre novelties of colour and proportion.” While you are busying yourself with this critical and discriminating activity you lose what really matters—the “moods of time and season,” the “spirit” of the place.

It is silly, unless you have found any evidence, to believe that flowers enjoy the air they breathe, and sillier not to add that, if this were true, flowers would undoubtedly have pains as well as pleasures.

I do not see how the “fear” of God could have ever meant to me anything but the lowest prudential efforts to be safe, if I had never seen certain ominous ravines and unapproachable crags. And if nature had never awakened certain longings in me, huge areas of what I can now mean by the “love” of God would never, so far as I can see, have existed.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">In some fashion. But not perhaps in so direct and simple a fashion as we at first might suppose. For of course all the facts stressed by nature-lovers of the other school are facts too; there are worms in the belly as well as primroses in the wood. Try to reconcile them, or to show that they don’t really need reconciliation, and you are turning from direct experience of nature—our present subject—to metaphysics or theodicy, or something of that sort. That may be a sensible thing to do; but I think it should be kept distinct from the love of nature. While we are on that level, while we are still claiming to speak of what nature has directly “said” to us, we must stick to it. We have seen an image of glory. We must not try to find a direct path through it and beyond it to an increasing knowledge of God. The path peters out almost at once. Terrors and mysteries, the whole depth of God’s counsels and the whole tangle of the history of the universe, choke it. We can’t get through; not that way. We must make a *détour*—leave the hills and woods and go back to our studies, to church, to our Bibles, to our knees. Otherwise the love of nature is beginning to turn into a nature religion.

Coleridge ended by being insensible to her; Wordsworth, by lamenting that the glory had passed away.

Neither of these is the efficient cause of national behaviour. For strictly speaking it is rulers, not nations, who behave internationally. Demoniac patriotism in their subjects—I write only for subjects—will make it easier for them to act wickedly; healthy patriotism may make it harder: when they are wicked they may by propaganda encourage a demoniac condition of our sentiments in order to secure our acquiescence in their wickedness.

Only foreigners and politicians talk about “Britain.” Kipling’s “I do not love my empire’s foes” strikes a ludicrously false note. *My* empire! With this love for the place there goes a love for the way of life; for beer and tea and open fires, trains with compartments in them and an unarmed police force and all the rest of it; for the local dialect and (a shade less) for our native language.

But those who do not love the fellow-villagers or fellow-townsmen whom they *have* seen are not likely to have got very far towards loving “Man” whom they have not. All natural affections, including this, can become rivals to spiritual love: but they can also be preparatory imitations of it, training (so to speak) of the spiritual muscles which Grace may later put to a higher service; as women nurse dolls in childhood and later nurse children.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我认为人们要从历史意象中受到鼓舞，而又不被欺骗或自我膨胀，这是可能的。历史意象的危险程度与人们多大程度地将它误解为或替代成严肃的系统的历史研究是一致的。只把这些故事当作故事传承下去并被人接受时，才是最好的。我这样说并非是指，这些故事应当只作为纯粹虚构的小说被传承下去（毕竟有些故事是真实的）。但是，重点应当放在这一类故事本身、放在激发想象力的图画、强化意志力的榜样上。听到这些故事的小学生应当隐约感觉到——尽管他自然无法用言语表达出来——自己在聆听*英雄事迹*。让他——最好是“在课外”——因聆听“征服帝国的事迹”而激动不已吧；然而，英雄事迹不可与“历史课”混淆，也不可与对帝国政策的认真分析（甚至是为其辩护）混淆，区分得越清晰越好。我小时候读过一本书，里面满是彩色图片，名为《我们岛国的故事》。我总觉得，这本书的名字非常恰当。它看起来压根就不像是教科书。在我看来，十分严肃地向年轻人灌输那些明知是错误或有失偏颇的历史，是十分有害的。这些不过是英雄传说的“历史”经过粗劣的伪装充当了教科书上的史实。而通过这种方式培养的爱国主义如果持续下去就是有害的，尽管它不太可能在一个受过教育的成年人身上维系下去。随之，悄悄混进了一种心照不宣的设想：其他国家的英雄比不上自己国家的英雄；甚至有可能混进了一种信念，即我们可以真正地“继承”一个传统——当然这是非常糟糕的生物学。这一切几乎不可避免地导致了有时被称为爱国主义的第三种成分。</td>
		<td class="en">I think it is possible to be strengthened by the image of the past without being either deceived or puffed up. The image becomes dangerous in the precise degree to which it is mistaken, or substituted, for serious and systematic historical study. The stories are best when they are handed on and accepted as stories. I do not mean by this that they should be handed on as mere fictions (some of them are after all true). But the emphasis should be on the tale as such, on the picture which fires the imagination, the example that strengthens the will. The schoolboy who hears them should dimly feel—though of course he cannot put it into words—that he is hearing *saga*. Let him be thrilled—preferably “out of school”—by the “Deeds that won the Empire”; but the less we mix this up with his “history lessons” or mistake it for a serious analysis—worse still, a justification—of imperial policy, the better. When I was a child I had a book full of coloured pictures called *Our Island Story*. That title has always seemed to me to strike exactly the right note. The book did not look at all like a text-book either. What does seem to me poisonous, what breeds a type of patriotism that is pernicious if it lasts but not likely to last long in an educated adult, is the perfectly serious indoctrination of the young in knowably false or biased history—the heroic legend drably disguised as text-book fact. With this creeps in the tacit assumption that other nations have not equally their heroes; perhaps even the belief—surely it is very bad biology—that we can literally “inherit” a tradition. And these almost inevitably lead on to a third thing that is sometimes called patriotism.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这第三种成分不是一种情感而是一种信仰：一种坚定的、甚至是平凡的信仰：我们的国家，事实上，长久以来一直，而且现在仍然是明显优于其他国家。我曾斗胆对一个宣扬这种爱国主义的老牧师说：“不过，牧师，您难道不是告诉我们*每个*民族都认为自己的男人是世上最勇敢的、自己的女人是世上最漂亮的吗？”他十分庄重地说——即使他当时是在圣坛上宣扬教义，他的表情也不会比这更为庄重了——“是的，但在英格兰这是正确的。”可以肯定的是，这种信念并未使我的朋友（愿上帝使他的灵魂安息）成为恶棍；他只是一个极其可爱的老顽固罢了。然而这种信念同样能够产生踢打抓咬之类顽固不化的人。在精神错乱的边缘，这种信念会逐渐变为基督教和科学都禁止的那种普遍的种族主义。</td>
		<td class="en">This third thing is not a sentiment but a belief: a firm, even prosaic belief that our own nation, in sober fact, has long been, and still is markedly superior to all others. I once ventured to say to an old clergyman who was voicing this sort of patriotism, “But, sir, aren’t we told that *every* people thinks its own men the bravest and its own women the fairest in the world?” He replied with total gravity—he could not have been graver if he had been saying the Creed at the altar—“Yes, but in England it’s true.” To be sure, this conviction had not made my friend (God rest his soul) a villain; only an extremely lovable old ass. It can however produce asses that kick and bite. On the lunatic fringe it may shade off into that popular Racialism which Christianity and science equally forbid. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这就引出了爱国主义的第四种成分。如果我们的国家真的比其他国家好这么多，那么我们或许可以认为。高一等的国家对其他国家负有义务或者享有权利。十九世纪，英国人很强烈地意识到了这种义务：“白种人的负担”。我们所认为的*土著人*是受我们监护的人，我们自诩为他们的保护者。这并非纯属伪善。我们的确给他们带来了一些好处。但是我们总是习惯说英国要建立起一个帝国的动机（或者任何年轻人在印度民政部寻求一个工作岗位的动机），好像一直以来都主要是无私地为了他国的利益，这种说话的习惯令整个世界都感到恶心。不过，这显示出了最大程度上的优越感。某些也感受到这种优越感的国家一直强调自己的权利而非义务。对这些国家来说，有些外国人简直太坏了，人人都有权消灭他们。还有一些外国人，他们只适合帮上帝的选民砍柴打水，那最好就让他们继续砍柴打水去吧。狗儿，认清你的主人！我远非暗指这两种态度是在同一水平上的。但二者都是致命的。二者都主张自己控制的疆土要“越变越大”。而且二者都具有这种不可置疑的邪恶印记：只有通过变得可怕，才能避免自己变得滑稽。如果没有违反与印第安人之间的条约，没有消灭塔斯马尼亚人，没有毒气室和贝尔森纳粹集中营，没有发生阿姆利则的惨案，没有对黑种人、棕色人种的歧视，也没有南非种族隔离，那么二者的自大将会是令人捧腹的闹剧。</td>
		<td class="en">This brings us to the fourth ingredient. If our nation is really so much better than others it may be held to have either the duties or the rights of a superior being towards them. In the nineteenth century the English became very conscious of such duties: the “white man’s burden.” What we called *natives* were our wards and we their self-appointed guardians. This was not all hypocrisy. We did do them some good. But our habit of talking as if England’s motives for acquiring an empire (or any youngster’s motives for seeking a job in the Indian Civil Service) had been mainly altruistic nauseated the world. And yet this showed the sense of superiority working at its best. Some nations who have also felt it have stressed the rights not the duties. To them, some foreigners were so bad that one had the right to exterminate them. Others, fitted only to be hewers of wood and drawers of water to the chosen people, had better be made to get on with their hewing and drawing. Dogs, know your betters! I am far from suggesting that the two attitudes are on the same level. But both are fatal. Both demand that the area in which they operate should grow “wider still and wider.” And both have about them this sure mark of evil: only by being terrible do they avoid being comic. If there were no broken treaties with Native Americans, no extermination of the Tasmanians, no gas-chambers and no Belsen, no Amritsar, Black and Tans or Apartheid, the pomposity of both would be roaring farce.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Love never spoke that way. It is like loving your children only “if they’re good,” your wife only while she keeps her looks, your husband only so long as he is famous and successful. “No man,” said one of the Greeks, “loves his city because it is great, but because it is his.” A man who really loves his country will love her in her ruin and degeneration—“England, with all thy faults, I love thee still.” She will be to him “a poor thing but mine own.” He may think her good and great, when she is not, because he loves her; the delusion is up to a point pardonable. But Kipling’s soldier reverses it; he loves her because he thinks her good and great—loves her on her merits. She is a fine going concern and it gratifies his pride to be in it. How if she ceased to be such? The answer is plainly given: “’Ow quick we’d drop’er.” When the ship begins to sink he will leave her. Thus that kind of patriotism which sets off with the greatest swagger of drums and banners actually sets off on the road that can lead to Vichy. And this is a phenomenon which will meet us again. When the natural loves become lawless they do not merely do harm to other loves; they themselves cease to be the loves they were—to be loves at all.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Patriotism has, then, many faces. Those who would reject it entirely do not seem to have considered what will certainly step—has already begun to step—into its place. For a long time yet, or perhaps forever, nations will live in danger. Rulers must somehow nerve their subjects to defend them or at least to prepare for their defence. Where the sentiment of patriotism has been destroyed this can be done only by presenting every international conflict in a purely ethical light. If people will spend neither sweat nor blood for “their country” they must be made to feel that they are spending them for justice, or civilization, or humanity. This is a step down, not up. Patriotic sentiment did not of course need to disregard ethics. Good men needed to be convinced that their country’s cause was just; but it was still their country’s cause, not the cause of justice as such. The difference seems to me important. I may without self-righteousness or hypocrisy think it just to defend my house by force against a burglar; but if I start pretending that I blacked his eye purely on moral grounds—wholly indifferent to the fact that the house in question was mine—I become insufferable. The pretence that when England’s cause is just we are on England’s side—as some neutral Don Quixote might be—for that reason alone, is equally spurious. And nonsense draws evil after it. If our country’s cause is the cause of God, wars must be wars of annihilation. A false transcendence is given to things which are very much of this world.</td></tr>

This terrible subject would require a book to itself. Here it will be enough to say that the Heavenly Society is also an earthly society. Our (merely natural) patriotism towards the latter can very easily borrow the transcendent claims of the former and use them to justify the most abominable actions.

		<td class="en">I begin with the humblest and most widely diffused of loves, the love in which our experience seems to differ least from that of the animals. Let me add at once that I do not on that account give it a lower value. Nothing in Man is either worse or better for being shared with the beasts. When we blame a man for being “a mere animal,” we mean not that he displays animal characteristics (we all do) but that he displays these, and only these, on occasions where the specifically human was demanded. (When we call him “brutal” we usually mean that he commits cruelties impossible to most real brutes; they’re not clever enough.) </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >希腊人把这种爱称为“storge”(有两个音节，“g”是“硬音”)。我在这儿将把它简单地称为“慈爱”。我那本《希腊语词典》把“storge”定义为：“慈爱，尤其是父母对孩子的爱”；并且也包括孩子对父母的爱。而且我确信，这是慈爱的最初形式，也是这个词的核心意义。我们首先想到的画面肯定是母亲给婴儿喂奶、母狗带着一大窝小狗、或母猫带着一大窝小猫：这些幼崽吱吱乱叫，挤在一起，拱来拱去，互相舔着，咕噜咕噜地叫着，依依呀呀，吮吸着奶，暖融融的，一派年轻生命的气息。</td>
		<td class="en">The Greeks called this love *storge* (two syllables and the g is “hard”). I shall here call it simply Affection. My *Greek Lexicon* defines *storge* as “affection, especially of parents to offspring”; but also of offspring to parents. And that, I have no doubt, is the original form of the thing as well as the central meaning of the word. The image we must start with is that of a mother nursing a baby, a bitch or a cat with a basketful of puppies or kittens; all in a squeaking, nuzzling heap together; purrings, lickings, baby-talk, milk, warmth, the smell of young life.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The importance of this image is that it presents us at the very outset with a certain paradox. The Need and Need-love of the young is obvious; so is the Gift-love of the mother. She gives birth, gives suck, gives protection. On the other hand, she must give birth or die. She must give suck or suffer. That way, her Affection too is a Need-love. There is the paradox. It is a Need-love but what it needs is to give. It is a Gift-love but it needs to be needed. We shall have to return to this point.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，慈爱远远超越了母亲和孩子之间的关系，即使在动物中也是如此，在我们人类中更甚。这种相处在一起所带来的温馨的舒适感和满足感在各种关系中都有所体现。这的确是最不含歧视的爱。我们或许会预料到，有些女人，追求者可能很少，有些男人可能朋友很少。他们没有什么可以给予。但是几乎所有人都能成为慈爱的对象——丑陋的、愚蠢的、甚至是令人恼火的人。被慈爱结合起来的人，并不需要有明显的适合之处。我曾见过，智障者不仅通过其父母，同时通过其兄弟也能感受到慈爱。年龄、性别、阶级和学历的阻碍都不重要。慈爱能存在于聪明年轻的大学生和年老的护士之间，尽管他们的思想世界不同。甚至物种之间的阻碍也不重要了。我们不仅能在人和狗之间看到慈爱，更令人吃惊的是，还可以在猫和狗之间看到。吉尔伯特·怀特声称在一匹马和一只母鸡之间也发现过慈爱。</td>
		<td class="en">But even in animal life, and still more in our own, Affection extends far beyond the relation of mother and young. This warm comfortableness, this satisfaction in being together, takes in all sorts of objects. It is indeed the least discriminating of loves. There are women for whom we can predict few wooers and men who are likely to have few friends. They have nothing to offer. But almost anyone can become an object of Affection; the ugly, the stupid, even the exasperating. There need be no apparent fitness between those whom it unites. I have seen it felt for an imbecile not only by his parents but by his brothers. It ignores the barriers of age, sex, class and education. It can exist between a clever young man from the university and an old nurse, though their minds inhabit different worlds. It ignores even the barriers of species. We see it not only between dog and man but, more surprisingly, between dog and cat. Gilbert White claims to have discovered it between a horse and a hen.</td></tr>

In *Tristram Shandy* “my father” and Uncle Toby are so far from being united by any community of interests or ideas that they cannot converse for ten minutes without cross-purposes; but we are made to feel their deep mutual affection. So with Don Quixote and Sancho Panza , Pickwick and Sam Weller, Dick Swiveller and the Marchioness.

		<td class="en">But Affection has its own criteria. Its objects have to be familiar. We can sometimes point to the very day and hour when we fell in love or began a new friendship. I doubt if we ever catch Affection beginning. To become aware of it is to become aware that it has already been going on for some time. The use of “old” or *vieux* as a term of Affection is significant. The dog barks at strangers who have never done it any harm and wags its tail for old acquaintances even if they never did it a good turn. The child will love a crusty old gardener who has hardly ever taken any notice of it and shrink from the visitor who is making every attempt to win its regard. But it must be an *old* gardener, one who has “always” been there—the short but seemingly immemorial “always” of childhood.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >正如我所说，慈爱是最为谦恭的爱，它从不装腔作势。人们会因“相爱”或者拥有友谊而骄傲。慈爱是谦恭的——甚至是隐秘的、羞怯的。有一次，我说在猫和狗之间经常看到这种慈爱时，我的朋友回应说：“对。但是我敢说没有一条狗会向其他狗承认这回事。”至少这是对许多人类慈爱的一种很好的漫画般的描摹。科摩斯说：“让相貌平庸的人呆在家里。”现在慈爱就相貌平平。许多我们对之慈爱的人同样也是相貌平平。我们爱他们并不就证明我们高尚或有洞察力，他们爱我们也是如此。我所说的欣赏之爱并不是慈爱的基本要素。通常只有离开或者失去那些仅仅因慈爱而和我们维系在一起的人们时，我们才会赞扬他们。我们把他们当作理所当然的：这种理所当然，在情爱中会成为暴行，但在这里，从某个角度讲，却是正确而合适的。它契合于这种感情舒适而安静的本质。如果慈爱经常被吵吵嚷嚷地表达出来的话，它将不再是慈爱；将慈爱公布于众，就像是搬家时把家里的家具搬出来一样。家具在它原来的地方很好，而在阳光下看起来却破烂、低俗、怪异。慈爱从头到尾潜伏或渗透在我们的生活中。它与简陋的、朴素的、私人的物品相依为伴：软拖鞋、旧衣服、老笑话、昏昏欲睡的小狗用尾巴敲打厨房地板的声音、缝纫机发出的声音，还有留在草坪上形状怪异的玩偶。</td>
		<td class="en">Affection, as I have said, is the humblest love. It gives itself no airs. People can be proud of being “in love,” or of friendship. Affection is modest—even furtive and shame-faced. Once when I had remarked on the affection quite often found between cat and dog, my friend replied, “Yes. But I bet no dog would ever confess it to the other dogs.” That is at least a good caricature of much human Affection. “Let homely faces stay at home,” says Comus. Now Affection has a very homely face. So have many of those for whom we feel it. It is no proof of our refinement or perceptiveness that we love them; nor that they love us. What I have called Appreciative love is no basic element in Affection. It usually needs absence or bereavement to set us praising those to whom only Affection binds us. We take them for granted: and this taking for granted, which is an outrage in erotic love, is here right and proper up to a point. It f its the comfortable, quiet nature of the feeling. Affection would not be affection if it was loudly and frequently expressed; to produce it in public is like getting your household furniture out for a move. It did very well in its place, but it looks shabby or tawdry or grotesque in the sunshine. Affection almost slinks or seeps through our lives. It lives with humble, un-dress, private things; soft slippers, old clothes, old jokes, the thump of a sleepy dog’s tail on the kitchen floor, the sound of a sewing-machine, a gollywog left on the lawn.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是我必须马上做一下修正。我所讨论的，是独立于其他爱而存在的慈爱。慈爱经常是独立存在的，但常常也并非如此。就像杜松子酒不仅本身是一种酒，还是许多混合酒的基本原料。因此慈爱，除了本身是一种爱之外，还能渗透到其他的爱中，浸染它们，从而成了其他的爱每天发挥作用的媒介。没有慈爱，那些爱可能也持续不了多久。交朋友与变得温柔亲切是不同的。不过，当你的朋友变成了老朋友，那么关于他的一切，虽然本来都与友爱无关，却变得熟悉起来，并随着熟悉而变得亲近起来。就情爱而言，我能想象到的最令人反感的就是，没有这种朴素的慈爱外衣的保护就仓促地去体验。那将是一种令人非常不安的情况，要么太纯洁了，要么太兽性了，要么两者交替；这对人类来说永远不够伟大也不够渺小。在友爱和情爱中都有那样的时刻，即当欣赏之爱躺下，可以说，蜷缩睡去，仅仅是这种关系（孤单而自由，并非孤独）所带来的轻松平凡包裹着我们之时，友情和情爱确有一种特殊的魅力。无需话语。无需做爱。也许除了拨拨炉火，根本没有其他任何需要。</td>
		<td class="en">But I must at once correct myself. I am talking of Affection as it is when it exists apart from the other loves. It often does so exist; often not. As gin is not only a drink in itself but also a base for many mixed drinks, so Affection, besides being a love itself, can enter into the other loves and colour them all through and become the very medium in which from day to day they operate. They would not perhaps wear very well without it. To make a friend is not the same as to become affectionate. But when your friend has become an old friend, all those things about him which had originally nothing to do with the friendship become familiar and dear with familiarity. As for erotic love, I can imagine nothing more disagreeable than to experience it for more than a very short time without this homespun clothing of affection. That would be a most uneasy condition, either too angelic or too animal or each by turn; never quite great enough or little enough for man. There is indeed a peculiar charm, both in friendship and in Eros, about those moments when Appreciative love lies, as it were, curled up asleep, and the mere ease and ordinariness of the relationship (free as solitude, yet neither is alone) wraps us round. No need to talk. No need to make love. No needs at all except perhaps to stir the fire.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这几种爱的混合和交叉，很好地体现在这一事实中：在多数时代和地域，这三种爱有共同的表现形式——吻。现在的英国，接吻已不用于友爱了，但慈爱和情爱还用。接吻对这两种爱来说都是必需的，以至于我们现在甚至无法说清楚到底是谁借用谁的，又或许根本就不存在借用。当然你会说，慈爱中的吻与情爱中的吻是不同的。是的，但并非爱人之间的所有吻都是爱情之吻。另外，这两种爱都倾向于使用“小语言”或“儿语”，这令许多现代人尴尬。而且，这不是人类所特有的。罗伦兹教授说过，寒鸦发情时的叫声“主要由成年寒鸦为了这些时刻所保留下来的婴儿般的声音组成”。（《所罗门王的戒指》，158页）。我们和寒鸦都出于同样的目的。幼年和成年时期的温情虽属不同种类，但都是温情，而我们用自己所知最早表达温情的语言来表达新的温情。</td>
		<td class="en">This blending and overlapping of the loves is well kept before us by the fact that at most times and places all three of them had in common, as their expression, the kiss. In modern England friendship no longer uses it, but Affection and Eros do. It belongs so fully to both that we cannot now tell which borrowed it from the other or whether there were borrowing at all. To be sure, you may say that the kiss of Affection differs from the kiss of Eros. Yes; but not all kisses between lovers are lovers’ kisses. Again, both these loves tend—and it embarrasses many moderns—to use a “little language” or “baby talk.” And this is not peculiar to the human species. Professor Lorenz has told us that when jackdaws are amorous their calls “consist chiefly of infantile sounds reserved by adult jackdaws for these occasions” (*King Solomon’s Ring*, p. 158). We and the birds have the same excuse. Different sorts of tenderness are both tenderness and the language of the earliest tenderness we have ever known is recalled to do duty for the new sort.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >慈爱最重要的一个副产品我们还没提到呢。我曾说过，慈爱的主要部分并非是欣赏之爱。慈爱不存在歧视。它可以与最没有希望的人“相处得还可以”。不过，颇为奇怪的是，正是这个事实意味着它最终会使欣赏变为可能，要不是因为慈爱，这种欣赏或许永远都不会存在。我们可以说，而且是很忠实地说，我们选择朋友和自己爱的女人是因为他们各方面的优点——美丽、坦率、善良、智慧、才智等等。但必须是我们所喜欢的那种智慧、美丽和善良，而且我们对这些都有个人喜好。这就是朋友之间和爱人们感觉彼此是“天造地设”的原因。慈爱值得夸耀的独特之处在于，它能把那些非常明显不合适的两个人，甚至他们在一起让人感到很滑稽的两个人结合起来；要不是命运把他们安排到了同一屋檐下或同一个社区，这些人永远都不会有任何关系。如果慈爱是在这样的情况下产生的，当然这种事很少发生，他们的眼界就会随之开阔起来。对“老某某”的喜爱不断加深，一开始仅仅因为他恰巧在那里，不久，我开始发现“他身上的某种东西”确实吸引着我。当一个人第一次非常认真地说：“虽然他和我‘不是同一种类型’，但是‘以他自己的行为方式而言’他是一个非常好的人。”这对说话者而言就是一种解放。我们也许并没有感觉到。我们感觉到的可能仅仅是包容和纵容，但是我们的确越过了一个边界。那句“以他自己的行为方式而言”意味着我们正在超越自己独有的喜好，意味着我们正学着去欣赏他们身上的善良和智慧，而不仅仅是那些迎合和符合我们口味的善良和智慧。</td>
		<td class="en">One of the most remarkable by-products of Affection has not yet been mentioned. I have said that is not primarily an Appreciative love. It is not discriminating. It can “rub along” with the most un-promising people. Yet oddly enough this very fact means that it can in the end make appreciations possible which, but for it, might never have existed. We may say, and not quite untruly, that we have chosen our friends and the woman we love for their various excellences—for beauty, frankness, goodness of heart, wit, intelligence, or what not. But it had to be the particular kind of wit, the particular kind of beauty, the particular kind of goodness that we like, and we have our personal tastes in these matters. That is why friends and lovers feel that they were “made for one another.” The especial glory of Affection is that it can unite those who most emphatically, even comically, are not; people who, if they had not found themselves put down by fate in the same household or community, would have had nothing to do with each other. If Affection grows out of this—of course it often does not—their eyes begin to open. Growing fond of “old so-and-so,” at first simply because he happens to be there, I presently begin to see that there is “something in him” after all. The moment when one first says, really meaning it, that though he is not “my sort of man” he is a very good man “in his own way” is one of liberation. It does not feel like that; we may feel only tolerant and indulgent. But really we have crossed a frontier. That “in his own way” means that we are getting beyond our own idiosyncrasies, that we are learning to appreciate goodness or intelligence in themselves, not merely goodness or intelligence flavoured and served to suit our own palate.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“狗和猫该一直放一起养，”有人这样说，“这将开阔它们的心胸。”慈爱开阔我们的心胸。在所有的自然之爱中，慈爱是最宽容、最不苛求、最广博的。从这个角度讲，无论你在外界结交的朋友是如何之多，在家里、大学、部队、船上、教堂里与你共处的人，其范围要比朋友圈子更大。拥有大批的朋友并不能证明我对人类的优秀之处有广泛的欣赏。你也许还会说，我喜欢自己书房里所有的书，以此来证明自己文学品位的广博。对这两种情况，答案是一样的：“那些书、那些朋友是你选择的，当然他们是适合你的。”真正广泛的阅读兴趣，让人能够在任何旧书店之外的廉价书摊上找到自己需要的书。同样，对人真正广泛的欣赏会让人在日常生活中遇到的人身上发现可欣赏之处。就我个人经验而言，正是慈爱催生出了这种兴趣，它首先教我们去注意那个“恰巧在那里”的人，之后是忍受他，然后是微笑地对待他，进而喜欢并最终欣赏他。他们是为我们而造的吗？谢天谢地，不是这么回事。他们就是他们自己，比你想象的要奇怪，比我们认为的要珍贵得多。</td>
		<td class="en">“Dogs and cats should always be brought up together,” said someone, “it broadens their minds so.” Affection broadens ours; of all natural loves it is the most catholic, the least finical, the broadest. The people with whom you are thrown together in the family, the college, the mess, the ship, the religious house, are from this point of view a wider circle than the friends, however numerous, whom you have made for yourself in the outer world. By having a great many friends I do not prove that I have a wide appreciation of human excellence. You might as well say I prove the width of my literary taste by being able to enjoy all the books in my own study. The answer is the same in both cases—“You chose those books. You chose those friends. Of course they suit you.” The truly wide taste in reading is that which enables a man to find something for his needs on the sixpenny tray outside any secondhand bookshop. The truly wide taste in humanity will similarly find something to appreciate in the cross-section of humanity whom one has to meet every day. In my experience it is Affection that creates this taste, teaching us first to notice, then to endure, then to smile at, then to enjoy, and finally to appreciate, the people who “happen to be there.” Made for us? Thank God, no. They are themselves, odder than you could have believed and worth far more than we guessed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在，我们快要谈到慈爱的危险之处了。我已经说过，慈爱从不装腔作势。圣保罗说过，仁爱不张狂。慈爱可以爱没有吸引力的人：上帝和其圣徒爱那些不可爱的人。慈爱“不会期望太多”，不在意错误，而且在争吵后会轻易地和好如初；因此仁爱恒久忍耐，恩慈而且宽恕他人。慈爱使我们看到了自己本无法看到的美德，或者说是没有慈爱我们就无法欣赏这些美德。谦卑的神圣也是如此。仅仅停留于这些相似性上，我们或许会因此而认为这种慈爱不仅仅是一种自然之爱，还是作用于人类心灵并且履行其法则的上帝之爱。维多利亚时期的小说家到底对不对呢？（这种）爱是否真的足够了呢？当“家人之间的慈爱”发展到最完美最充分的时候，是否就与基督徒的生活一样了呢？我认为，所有这些问题的答案必然都是否定的。</td>
		<td class="en">And now we are drawing near the point of danger. Affection, I have said, gives itself no airs; charity, said St. Paul, is not puffed up. Affection can love the unattractive: God and His saints love the unlovable. Affection “does not expect too much,” turns a blind eye to faults, revives easily after quarrels; just so charity suffers long and is kind and forgives. Affection opens our eyes to goodness we could not have seen, or should not have appreciated without it. So does humble sanctity. If we dwelled exclusively on these resemblances we might be led on to believe that this Affection is not simply one of the natural loves but is Love Himself working in our human hearts and fulfilling the law. Were the Victorian novelists right after all? Is love (of this sort) really enough? Are the “domestic affections,” when in their best and fullest development, the same thing as the Christian life? The answer to all these questions, I submit, is certainly No.</td></tr>

God is the great Rival, the ultimate object of human jealousy; that beauty, terrible as the Gorgon’s, which may at any moment steal from me—or it seems like stealing to me—my wife’s or husband’s or daughter’s heart. The bitterness of some unbelief, though disguised even from those who feel it as anti-clericalism or hatred of superstition, is really due to this.

		<td class="en">Now there is a clear reason why this craving, of all love-cravings, easily becomes the most unreasonable. I have said that almost anyone may be the object of Affection. Yes; and almost everyone expects to be. The egregious Mr. Pontifex in *The Way of All Flesh* is outraged to discover that his son does not love him; It is “unnatural ”for a boy not to love him own father. It never occurs to him to ask whether, since the first day the boy can remember, he has ever done or said anything that could excite love. Similarly, at the beginning of *King Lear* the hero is shown as a very unlovable old man devoured with a ravenous appetite for Affection. I am driven to literary examples because you, the reader, and I do not live in the same neighborhood; if we did, there would unfortunately be no difficulty about replacing them with examples from real life. The thing happens every day. And we can see why. We all know that we must do something, if not to merit, at least to attract, erotic love or friendship. But Affection is often assumed to be provided, ready made, by nature; “built-in,” “laid-on,” “on the house.” We have a right to expect it. If the others do not give it, they are “unnatural.” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这种假设毫无疑问是对真理的歪曲。有很多东西都是“与生俱来的”。由于我们是哺乳动物，本能将至少会提供某种程度的（经常是很高程度的）母爱。由于我们是社会性的动物，各种熟悉的关系会提供一个场所，如果一切顺利，慈爱会在那里产生并发展壮大，而且不要求爱的对象具有任何十分引人注目的品质。如果我们得到慈爱，那不一定是因为我们有优点；我们不需多大的努力就可能得到慈爱。从对这个真理（许多人得到的慈爱，远远超出他们的美德）的模糊理解出发，菲尼克斯先生得出了一个荒谬的结论：“因此，我即使没有优点，也有权拥有它。”这就像是从更高层面上说，我们可以辩称由于没有人因其优点而有权得到上帝的恩典，那么由于我没有任何优点，我就有权获得恩典。在这两种情况中，涉及的都不是权利问题。如果我们和我们的亲友们差不多都只是普通人，那么我们所拥有的就不是“期待的权利”，而是对获得亲友对我们的爱的“合理期待”。但是，我们或许不是普通人，我们可能令人无法忍受。如果我们真是这样的话，“天性”就会和我们作对。因为同样亲密的关系可能产生慈爱也——一样很自然地——可能会产生一种奇特的、无法改变的厌恶；这种憎恨，与相对应的爱一样古老、持久、不显眼而且有时几乎是无意识的。歌剧中的齐格弗里德，不记得从何时起他那矮小的养父的笨手笨脚、喃喃自语和坐立不安已变得令人厌恶。这种憎恨与慈爱相似，我们从未觉察它是何时开始的。憎恨总是早就在那里了。请注意，“老”这个词既可以表达钟爱，也可以表达由厌倦而产生的厌恶：“他那老把戏”，“他那老一套”，“就那老掉牙的东西”。</td>
		<td class="en">This assumption is no doubt the distortion of a truth. Much has been “built-in.” Because we are a mammalian species, instinct will provide at least some degree, often a high one, of maternal love. Because we are a social species familiar association provides a *milieu* in which, if all goes well, Affection will arise and grow strong without demanding any very shinning qualities in its objects. If it is given us it will not necessarily be given us on our merits; we may get it with very little trouble. From a dim perception of the truth (many are loved with Affection far beyond their deserts) Mr. Pontifex draws the ludicrous conclusion, “Therefore I, without desert, have a right to it.” It is as if, on a far higher plane, we argued that because no man by merit has a right to the Grace of God, I, having no merit, am entitled to it. There is no question of rights in either case. What we have is not “a right to expect” but a “reasonable expectation” of being loved by our intimates if we, and they, are more or less ordinary people. But we may not be. We may be intolerable. If we are, “nature” will work against us. For the very same conditions of intimacy which make Affection possible also—and no less naturally—make possible a peculiarly incurable distaste; a hatred as immemorial, constant, unemphatic, almost at times unconscious, as the corresponding form of love. Siegfried, in the opera, could not remember a time before every shuffle, mutter, and fidget of his dwarfish foster-father had become odious. We never catch this kind of hatred, any more than Affection, at the moment of its beginning. It was always there before. Notice that *old* is a term of wearied loathing as well as of endearment: “at his old tricks,” “in his old way,” “the same old thing.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">It would be absurd to say that Lear is lacking in Affection. In so far as Affection is Need-love he is half-crazy with it. Unless, in his own way, he loved his daughters he would not so desperately desire their love. The most unlovable parent (or child) may be full of such ravenous love. But it works to their own misery and everyone else’s. The situation becomes suffocating. If people are already unlovable a continual demand on their part (as of right) to be loved—their manifest sense of injury, their reproaches, whether loud and clamorous or merely implicit in every look and gesture of resentful self-pity—produce in us a sense of guilt (they are intended to do so) for a fault we could not have avoided and cannot cease to commit. They seal up the very fountain for which they are thirsty. If ever, at some favoured moment, any germ of Affection for them stirs in us, their demand for more and still more petrifies us again. And of course such people always desire the same proof of our love; we are to join their side, to hear and share their grievance against someone else. If my boy really loved me he would see how selfish his father is... if my brother loved me he would make a party with me against my sister... if you loved me you wouldn’t let me be treated like this... </td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >又一次，一件事这么接近真理却又彻底地错了。慈爱是旧衣服，是毫无防备时刻的放松，如果我们与陌生人这样相处的话，就会显得没有教养。不过旧衣服是一回事，同一件衬衫穿到发臭则是另一回事。参加游园会有适合游园会的衣服，但在家里穿的衣服也必须合适得体，只是因场合不同而有其自己的特点。同样，在公共场合的礼貌和在家里的礼貌是不同的。但二者的根本原则是相同的：“任何人不可偏袒自己。”但是场合越公开，我们对这个原则的遵守就越被“限制”，或者变得更加正式。得体的行为举止有其规则。场合越亲近，就越不正式；但是并非因此就不需要礼貌。相反，处于最佳状态的慈爱所表现出的礼貌，更加微妙、敏感而深刻，远非公共场合的礼貌可比。公众场合具有固定的规矩。在家里，你必须拥有那些规矩背后的真实生活，否则就会出现最严重的个人主义。你必须真的不给自己任何偏袒；聚会时，隐藏起这种偏爱就足够了。由此产生了那句古老的谚语：“和我一起住，你就会了解我了。”因此，一个人在家的举止，首先透露了他在“社交”或“聚会”时举止的真实程度（令人极为讨厌的一个字眼！）。从舞会或雪利酒会回家后就把礼貌抛诸脑后的那种人，就算是在舞会或雪利酒会上也谈不上真正地懂礼貌。他们仅仅是模仿那些有礼貌的人罢了。</td>
		<td class="en">Once again it is so nearly true yet so fatally wrong. Affection is an affair of old clothes, and ease, of the unguarded moment, of liberties which would be ill-bred if we took them with strangers. But old clothes are one thing; to wear the same shirt till it stank would be another. There are proper clothes for a garden party; but the clothes for home must be proper too, in their own different way. Similarly there is a distinction between public and domestic courtesy. The root principle of both is the same: “that no one give any kind of preference to himself.” But the more public the occasion, the more our obedience to this principle has been “taped” or formalised. There are “rules” of good manners. The more intimate the occasion, the less the formalisation; but not therefore the less need of courtesy. On the contrary, Affection at its best practises a courtesy which is incomparably more subtle, sensitive, and deep than the public kind. In public a ritual would do. At home you must have the reality which that ritual represented, or else the deafening triumphs of the greatest egoist present. You must really give no kind of preference to yourself; at a party it is enough to conceal the preference. Hence the old proverb “come live with me and you’ll know me.” Hence a man’s familiar manners first reveal the true value of his (significantly odious phrase!) “Company” or “Party” manners. Those who leave their manners behind them when they come home from the dance or the sherry party have no real courtesy even there. They were merely aping those who had. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们相互之间可以*无话不谈*。”这句话的真正意思是，处于最佳状态的慈爱可以说出其在该状态下想说的任何话，无需考虑公共礼仪的那些规矩；因为慈爱在最佳状态时不希望伤害、侮辱、压制别人。当你挚友的妻子无意间把她自己和你的鸡尾酒统统喝光时，你或许会称她为“猪”。你或许会对父亲大喊大叫，让他不要再讲那讲了一遍又一遍的故事。你或许会戏弄、哄骗，嘲笑他人。你可以说“闭嘴。我想看书。”你可以在合适的时刻用合适的语调做任何事情——这些语调和时刻不是我们刻意追求的，也就不会伤害别人。慈爱越是深刻自然，就越能准确地分清什么是合适的语调和时刻（每种爱都有其*爱的艺术*）。当家中粗鲁无礼的人声称可以随意说“任何话”时，那么这种情况与前文所说的是完全不同的。他自己拥有的慈爱非常不健全，或者也许在那个时刻完全没有慈爱，而他却会冒称自己拥有美好的随意，这种随意只有最为完满的慈爱才有权拥有或者才知道如何去驾驭。随后，他会根据个人的喜恶或一己私利去恶意、无情地使用该“随意”；最理想的情况也不过是很愚蠢地使用这种“随意”，不讲究艺术。他可能一直都心安理得。他知道具有慈爱之情的人之间言语行为具有随意性。他对他人很随便，因此（他总结说）他是有慈爱之心的。他憎恨一切，却说是你的爱有缺陷。说他受到了伤害，他被误解了。</td>
		<td class="en">“We can say *anything* to one another.” The truth behind this is that Affection at its best can say whatever Affection at its best wishes to say, regardless of the rules that govern public courtesy; for Affection at its best wishes neither to wound nor to humiliate nor to domineer. You may address the wife of your bosom as “Pig!” when she has inadvertently drunk your cocktail as well as her own. You may roar down the story which your father is telling once too often. You may tease and hoax and banter. You can say “Shut up. I want to read.” You can do anything in the right tone and at the right moment—the tone and moment which are not intended to, and will not, hurt. The better the Affection the more unerringly it knows which these are (every love has its *art of love*). But the domestic Rudesby means something quite different when he claims liberty to say “anything.” Having a very imperfect sort of Affection himself, or perhaps at that moment none, he arrogates to himself the beautiful liberties which only the fullest Affection has a right to or knows how to manage. He then uses them spitefully in obedience to his resentments; or ruthlessly in obedience to his egoism; or at best stupidly, lacking the art. And all the time he may have a clear conscience. He knows that Affection takes liberties. He is taking liberties. Therefore (he concludes) he is being affectionate. Resent anything and he will say that the defect of love is on your side. He is hurt. He has been misunderstood. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是，他有时会端起架子并且刻意变得“有礼貌”起来，以此来为自己“复仇”。其暗含之意当然是：“噢，这么说我们不再亲密了啊？我们之间的举止行为仅限于点头之交那样？我原本希望——但是没关系。您请便吧。”这很好地说明了亲密的人之间的礼貌和正式场合下的礼貌的区别。十分适合其中一种场合的举止行为，放在另一种场合可能会不符合该场合应有的礼貌。当你被介绍给一个有名望的陌生人时，表现得随意和放松是不礼貌的；在家里表现出正式的、礼节性的礼貌（“在私人场合表现出公众场合的行为”）是不礼貌的，而且是有意表现得不礼貌。在《项狄传》中有一个很恰当的例子，诠释了什么是真正得体的家庭举止。在一个十分不合适的时刻，托比叔叔一直滔滔不绝地讲他最为喜欢的主题——构筑防御工事。“我父亲”唯有这一次实在忍无可忍，粗暴地打断了他的话。接着，他看到了弟弟的脸——托比那张毫无反击报复之意的脸，流露出深深地受到了伤害的神情，不是由于父亲对他的轻蔑——他绝不会这样想——而是由于对构筑防御工事这门崇高艺术的轻蔑。“我父亲”立即悔悟了，向他道歉，于是两人彻底和解。托比叔叔，为了表现出他完全原谅父亲了，表现出他并未端着架子保持尊严，又继续谈起防御工事来。</td>
		<td class="en">He then sometimes avenges himself by getting on his high horse and becoming elaborately “polite.” The implication is of course, “Oh! So we are not to be intimate? We are to behave like mere acquaintances? I had hoped—but no matter. Have it your own way.” This illustrates prettily the difference between intimate and formal courtesy. Precisely what suits the one may be a breach of the other. To be free and easy when you are presented to some eminent stranger is bad manners; to practice formal and ceremonial courtesies at home (“public faces in private places”) is—and is always intended to be—bad manners. There is a delicious illustration of really good domestic manners in *Tristram Shandy*. At a singularly unsuitable moment Uncle Toby has been holding forth on his favourite theme of fortification. “My Father,” driven for once beyond endurance, violently interrupts. Then he sees his brother’s face; the utterly unretaliating face of Toby, deeply wounded, not by the slight to himself—he would never think of that—but by the slight to the noble art. My Father at once repents. There is an apology, a total reconciliation. Uncle Toby, to show how complete is his forgiveness, to show that he is not on his dignity, resumes the lecture on fortification. </td></tr>

They have read the same comics, climbed the same trees, been pirates or spacemen together, taken up and abandoned stamp-collecting at the same moment. Then a dreadful thing happens. One of them flashes ahead—discovers poetry or science or serious music or perhaps undergoes a religious conversion. His life is flooded with the new interest. The other cannot share it; he is left behind. I doubt whether even the infidelity of a wife or husband raises a more miserable sense of desertion or a fiercer jealousy than this can sometimes do. It is not yet jealousy of the new friends whom the deserter will soon be making. That will come; at first it is jealousy of the thing itself—of this science, this music, of God (always called “religion” or “all this religion” in such contexts). The jealousy will probably be expressed by ridicule. The new interest is “all silly nonsense,” contemptibly childish (or contemptibly grown-up), or else the deserter is not really interested in it at all—he’s showing off, swanking; it’s all affectation. Presently the books will be hidden, the scientific specimens destroyed, the radio forcibly switched off the classical programmes. For Affection is the most instinctive, in that sense the most animal, of the loves; its jealousy is proportionately fierce. It snarls and bares its teeth like a dog whose food has been snatched away.

		<td class="en">I am thinking of Mrs. Fidget, who died a few months ago. It is really astonishing how her family have brightened up. The drawn look has gone from her husband’s face; he begins to be able to laugh. The younger boy, whom I had always thought an embittered, peevish little creature, turns out to be quite human. The elder, who was hardly ever at home except when he was in bed, is nearly always there now and has begun to reorganise the garden. The girl, who was always supposed to be “delicate” (though I never found out what exactly the trouble was), now has the riding lessons which were once out of the question, dances all night, and plays any amount of tennis. Even the dog who was never allowed out except on a lead is now a well-known member of the Lamp-post Club in their road.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Mrs. Fidget very often said that she lived for her family. And it was not untrue. Everyone in the neighborhood knew it. “She lives for her family,” they said; “what a wife and mother!” She did all the washing; true, she did it badly, and they could have afforded to send it out to a laundry, and they frequently begged her not to do it. But she did. There was always a hot lunch for anyone who was at home and always a hot meal at night (even in midsummer). They implored her not to provide this. They protested almost with tears in their eyes (and with truth) that they liked cold meals. It made no difference. She was living for her family. She always sat up to “welcome” you home if you were out late at night; two or three in the morning, it made no odds; you would always find the frail, pale, weary face awaiting you, like a silent accusation. Which meant of course that you couldn’t with any decency go out very often. She was always making things too; being in her own estimation (I’m no judge myself) an excellent amateur dressmaker and a great knitter. And of course, unless you were a heartless brute, you had to wear the things. (The Vicar tells me that, since her death, the contributions of that family alone to “sales of work” outweigh those of all his other parishioners put together.) And then her care for their health! She bore the whole burden of that daughter’s “delicacy” alone. The Doctor—an old friend, and it was not being done on National Health—was never allowed to discuss matters with his patient. After the briefest examination of her, he was taken into another room by the mother. The girl was to have no worries, no responsibility for her own health. Only loving care; caresses, special foods, horrible tonic wines, and breakfast in bed. For Mrs. Fidget, as she so often said, would “work her fingers to the bone” for her family. They couldn’t stop her. Nor could they—being decent people—quite sit still and watch her do it. They had to help. Indeed they were always having to help. That is, they did things for her to help her to do things for them which they didn’t want done. As for the dear dog, it was to her, she said, “Just like one of the children.” It was in fact, as like one of them as she could make it. But since it had no scruples it got on rather better than they, and though vetted, dieted and guarded within an inch of its life, contrived sometimes to reach the dustbin or the dog next door.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">It is easy to see how liability to this state is, so to speak, congenital in the maternal instinct. This, as we saw, is a Gift-love, but one that needs to give; therefore needs to be needed. But the proper aim of giving is to put the recipient in a state where he no longer needs our gift. We feed children in order that they may soon be able to feed themselves; we teach them in order that they may soon not need our teaching. Thus a heavy task is laid upon this Gift-love. It must work towards its own abdication. We must aim at making ourselves superfluous. The hour when we can say “They need me no longer” should be our reward. But the instinct, simply in its own nature, has no power to fulfill this law. The instinct desires the good of its object, but not simply; only the good it can itself give. A much higher love—a love which desires the good of the object as such, from whatever source that good comes—must step in and help or tame the instinct before it can make the abdication. And of course it often does. But where it does not, the ravenous need to be needed will gratify itself either by keeping its objects needy or by inventing for them imaginary needs. It will do this all the more ruthlessly because it thinks (in one sense truly) that it is a Gift-love and therefore regards itself as “un-selfish.”</td></tr>

Naturally, and delightfully, they continued to visit him after the tutorial relation had ended—went round to his house of an evening and had famous discussions. But the curious thing is that this never lasted. Sooner or later—it might be within a few months or even a few weeks—came the fatal evening when they knocked on his door and were told that the Doctor was engaged. After that he would always be engaged. They were banished from him forever. This was because, at their last meeting, they had rebelled. They had asserted their independence—differed from the master and supported their own view, perhaps not without success. Faced with that very independence which he had laboured to produce and which it was his duty to produce if he could, Dr. Quartz could not bear it.

		<td class="en">This terrible need to be needed often finds its outlet in pampering an animal. To learn that someone is “fond of animals” tells us very little until we know in what way. For there are two ways. On the one hand the higher and domesticated animal is, so to speak, a “bridge” between us and the rest of nature. We all at times feel somewhat painfully our human isolation from the sub-human world—the atrophy of instinct which our intelligence entails, our excessive self-consciousness, the innumerable complexities of our situation, our inability to live in the present. If only we could shuffle it all off! We must not—and incidentally we can’t—become beasts. But we can be *with* a beast. It is personal enough to give the word *with* a real meaning; yet it remains very largely an unconscious little bundle of biological impulses. It has three legs in nature’s world and one in ours. It is a link, an ambassador. Who would not wish, as Bosanquet put it, “to have a representative at the court of Pan”? Man with dog closes a gap in the universe. But of course animals are often used in a worse fashion. If you need to be needed and if your family, very properly, decline to need you, a pet is the obvious substitute. You can keep it all its life in need of you. You can keep it permanently infantile, reduce it to permanent invalidism, cut it off from all genuine animal well-being, and compensate for this by creating needs for countless little indulgences which only you can grant. The unfortunate creature thus becomes very useful to the rest of the household; it acts as a sump or drain—you are too busy spoiling a dog’s life to spoil theirs. Dogs are better for this purpose than cats: a monkey, I am told, is best of all. Also it is more like the real thing. To be sure, it’s all very bad luck for the animal. But probably it cannot fully realise the wrong you have done it. Better still, you would never know if it did. The most down-trodden human, driven too far, may one day turn and blurt out a terrible truth. Animals can’t speak.</td></tr>

I shall therefore have some sympathy with those whose comment on the last few pages takes the form “Of course. Of course. These things do happen. Selfish or neurotic people can twist anything, even love, into some sort of misery or exploitation. But why stress these marginal cases?

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >首先，关于*精神不健全*。我认为把慈爱的这些有害的状态划分为病态不利于我们更清楚地看清事物。毫无疑问，病态是的确存在的，对某些人来说，要抵制诱惑，不让慈爱往这些有害的状态发展，尤其困难甚至是不可能的。我们应该想方设法把那些人送去就医。但是我认为每个对自己诚实的人都会承认他们曾受到过这些诱惑。出现这种情况并不是一种疾病的表现；或者如果是疾病，这种疾病的名字是“一个堕落的人”。对普通人来说，对这些诱惑的屈服（有时谁能免于屈服呢？）不是疾病而是罪过。对此，精神上的指引要比医学治疗更有作用。药物是要恢复“自然”结构或“正常”功能。贪婪、自我主义、自欺和自怜的不自然或不正常，并不像散光、浮游肾这种不自然、不正常。谁能够以上帝的名义把这些完全没有堕落欲望的人看成是自然的或者正常的呢？“自然”，如果你喜欢，那也是从完全不同的意义上讲的，极度自然的、不会堕落的。我们仅仅见过一位这样的人。他一点也不像心理学家所描述的性格完整、心态平衡、适应环境、婚姻幸福、事业有成、受大家欢迎的市民形象。如果他说你“被魔鬼附身”，那么你就根本无法真正很好地“适应”你周围的环境，最后还会被赤身裸体地钉在十字架上。</td>
		<td class="en">Firstly, as to *neurotic*. I do not think we shall see things more clearly by classifying all these malefical states of Affection as pathological. No doubt there are really pathological conditions which make the temptation to these states abnormally hard or even impossible to resist for particular people. Send those people to the doctors by all means. But I believe that everyone who is honest with himself will admit that he has felt these temptations. Their occurrence is not a disease; or if it is, the name of that disease is Being a Fallen Man. In ordinary people the yielding to them—and who does not sometimes yield?—is not disease, but sin. Spiritual direction will here help us more than medical treatment. Medicine labours to restore “natural” structure or “normal” function. But greed, egoism, self-deception and self-pity are not unnatural or abnormal in the same sense as astigmatism or a floating kidney. For who, in Heaven’s name, would describe as natural or normal the man from whom these failings were wholly absent? “Natural,” if you like, in a quite different sense; archnatural, unfallen. We have seen only one such Man. And He was not at all like the psychologist’s picture of the integrated, balanced, adjusted, happily married, employed, popular citizen. You can’t really be very well “adjusted” to your world if it says you “have a devil” and ends by nailing you up naked to a stake of wood.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But secondly, the comment in its own language admits the very thing I am trying to say. Affection produces happiness if—and only if—there is common sense and give and take and “decency.” In other words, only if something more, and other, than Affection is added. The mere feeling is not enough. You need “common sense,” that is, reason. You need “give and take”; that is, you need justice, continually stimulating mere Affection when it fades and restraining it when it forgets or would defy the *art* of love. You need “decency.” There is no disguising the fact that this means goodness; patience, self-denial, humility, and the continual intervention of a far higher sort of love than Affection, in itself, can ever be. That is the whole point. If we try to live by Affection alone, Affection will “go bad on us.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我想我们很少会意识到慈爱会变质到何种程度。菲吉特太太真的完全没有意识到自己施加到家人身上的没完没了的沮丧和痛苦吗？这令人难以置信。她明白（她当然明白）当你知道回家后会发现她毫无意义地“不睡觉等你回来”，像控诉一般时，你整个晚上的心情就被她毁掉了。她一直这么做，因为如果她不这样做，她就得面对一个自己决心不去看的事实，她就会知道自己不再被需要。这是第一个动机。其次，她一辈子的艰辛掩盖了她暗自对自己的爱的性质的怀疑。她的脚越灼痛，她的背越疼，她就感觉越好，因为这种痛会在她耳边说：“做了所有这些，我该多么爱他们啊！”这是第二个动机。但是我想还有更深一层的东西。家人们对菲吉特太太不领情、用难听的伤人的话语（任何事情都会“伤害”到菲吉特太太这样的人）让她把该洗的衣服送去洗衣店，这会使她感到自己被凌辱了，因此，她会产生一种持续的委屈感，享受怨恨带来的乐趣。如果有人说他不知道什么是憎恨带来的乐趣，那么他不是个骗子就是个圣人。事实上，只有对那些心怀憎恨的人来说这些才是乐趣。不过这样的话，像菲吉特太太这样的爱就包含了大量的恨的成分。对于情爱，罗马诗人曾经说过：“我既爱又恨。”但其他种类的爱也会爱恨交织。它们自身也包含了恨的种子。如果慈爱变成了人类生活中的绝对主宰，这些种子就会发芽。爱，一旦成了神，亦即沦为魔鬼。</td>
		<td class="en">How bad, I believe we seldom recognise. Can Mrs. Fidget really have been quite unaware of the countless frustrations and miseries she inflicted on her family? It passes belief. She knew—of course she knew—that it spoiled your whole evening to know that when you came home you would find her uselessly, accusingly, “sitting up for you.” She continued all these practices because if she had dropped them she would have been faced with the fact she was determined not to see; would have known that she was not necessary. That is the first motive. Then too, the very laboriousness of her life silenced her secret doubts as to the quality of her love. The more her feet burned and her back ached, the better, for this pain whispered in her ear “How much I must love them if I do all this!” That is the second motive. But I think there is a lower depth. The unappreciativeness of the others, those terrible, wounding words—anything will “wound” a Mrs. Fidget—in which they begged her to send the washing out, enabled her to feel ill- used, therefore, to have a continual grievance, to enjoy the pleasures of resentment. If anyone says he does not know those pleasures, he is a liar or a saint. It is true that they are pleasures only to those who hate. But then a love like Mrs. Fidget’s contains a good deal of hatred. It was of erotic love that the Roman poet said, “I love and hate,” but other kinds of love admit the same mixture. They carry in them the seeds of hatred. If Affection is made the absolute sovereign of a human life the seeds will germinate. Love, having become a god, becomes a demon.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">When either Affection or Eros is one’s theme, one finds a prepared audience. The importance and beauty of both have been stressed and almost exaggerated again and again. Even those who would debunk them are in conscious reaction against this laudatory tradition and, to that extent, influenced by it. But very few modern people think Friendship a love of comparable value or even a love at all. I cannot remember that any poem since *In Memoriam*, or any novel, has celebrated it. Tristan and Isolde, Antony and Cleopatra, Romeo and Juliet, have innumerable counterparts in modern literature: David and Jonathan, Pylades and Orestes, Roland and Oliver, Amis and Amile, have not. To the Ancients, Friendship seemed the happiest and most fully human of all loves; the crown of life and the school of virtue. The modern world, in comparison, ignores it. We admit of course that besides a wife and family a man needs a few “friends.” But the very tone of the admission, and the sort of acquaintanceships which those who make it would describe as “friendships,” show clearly that what they are talking about has very little to do with that *Philia* which Aristotle classified among the virtues or that *Amicitia* on which Cicero wrote a book. It is something quite marginal; not a main course in life’s banquet; a diversion; something that fills up the chinks of one’s time. How has this come about?</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The first and most obvious answer is that few value it because few experience it. And the possibility of going through life without the experience is rooted in that fact which separates Friendship so sharply from both the other loves. Friendship is—in a sense not at all derogatory to it—the least *natural* of loves; the least instinctive, organic, biological, gregarious and necessary. It has least commerce with our nerves; there is nothing throaty about it; nothing that quickens the pulse or turns you red and pale. It is essentially between individuals; the moment two men are friends they have in some degree drawn apart together from the herd. Without Eros none of us would have been begotten and without Affection none of us would have been reared; but we can live and breed without Friendship. The species, biologically considered, has no need of it. The pack or herd—the community—may even dislike and distrust it. Its leaders very often do. Headmasters and Head mistresses and Heads of religious communities, colonels and ships’ captains, can feel uneasy when close and strong friendships arise between little knots of their subjects.</td></tr>

Nature and emotion and the body were feared as dangers to our souls, or despised as degradations of our human status. Inevitably that sort of love was most prized which seemed most independent, or even defiant, of mere nature. Affection and Eros were too obviously connected with our nerves, too obviously shared with the brutes. You could feel these tugging at your guts and fluttering in your diaphragm. But in Friendship—in that luminous, tranquil, rational world of relationships freely chosen—you got away from all that. This alone, of all the loves, seemed to raise you to the level of gods or angels.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But then came Romanticism and “tearful comedy” and the “return to nature” and the exaltation of Sentiment; and in their train all that great wallow of emotion which, though often criticised, has lasted ever since. Finally, the exaltation of instinct, the dark gods in the blood; whose hierophants may be incapable of male friendship. Under this new dispensation all that had once commended this love now began to work against it. It had not tearful smiles and keepsakes and baby-talk enough to please the sentimentalists. There was not blood and guts enough about it to attract the primitivists. It looked thin and etiolated; a sort of vegetarian substitute for the more organic loves.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Other causes have contributed. To those—and they are now the majority—who see human life merely as a development and complication of animal life all forms of behaviour which cannot produce certificates of an animal origin and of survival value are suspect. Friendship’s certificates are not very satisfactory. Again, that outlook which values the collective above the individual necessarily disparages Friendship; it is a relation between men at their highest level of individuality. It withdraws men from collective “togetherness” as surely as solitude itself could do; and more dangerously, for it withdraws them by two’s and three’s. Some forms of democratic sentiment are naturally hostile to it because it is selective and an affair of the few. To say “These are my friends” implies “Those are not.” For all these reasons if a man believes (as I do) that the old estimate of Friendship was the correct one, he can hardly write a chapter on it except as a rehabilitation.</td></tr>

To say that every Friendship is consciously and explicitly homosexual would be too obviously false; the wiseacres take refuge in the less palpable charge that it is *really*—unconsciously, cryptically, in some Pickwickian sense—homosexual. And this, though it cannot be proved, can never of course be refuted. The fact that no positive evidence of homosexuality can be discovered in the behaviour of two Friends does not disconcert the wiseacres at all: “That,” they say gravely, “is just what we should expect.” The very lack of evidence is thus treated as evidence; the absence of smoke proves that the fire is very carefully hidden. Yes—if it exists at all. But we must first prove its existence.

The rest of us know that though we can have erotic love and friendship for the same person yet in some ways nothing is less like a Friendship than a love-affair. Lovers are always talking to one another about their love; Friends hardly ever about their Friendship. Lovers are normally face to face, absorbed in each other; Friends, side by side, absorbed in some common interest. Above all, Eros (while it lasts) is necessarily between two only. But two, far from being the necessary number for Friendship, is not even the best. And the reason for this is important. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">Lamb says somewhere that if, of three friends (A, B, and C), A should die, then B loses not only A but “A’s part in C,” while C loses not only A but “A’s part in B.” In each of my friends there is something that only some other friend can fully bring out. By myself I am not large enough to call the whole man into activity; I want other lights than my own to show all his facets. Now that Charles is dead, I shall never again see Ronald’s reaction to a specifically Caroline joke. Far from having more of Ronald, having him “to myself” now that Charles is away, I have less of Ronald. Hence true Friendship is the least jealous of loves. Two friends delight to be joined by a third, and three by a fourth, if only the newcomer is qualified to become a real friend. They can then say, as the blessed souls say in Dante, “Here comes one who will augment our loves.” For in this love “to divide is not to take away.” Of course the scarcity of kindred souls—not to mention practical considerations about the size of rooms and the audibility of voices—set limits to the enlargement of the circle; but within those limits we possess each friend not less but more as the number of those with whom we share him increases. In this, Friendship exhibits a glorious “nearness by resemblance” to Heaven itself where the very multitude of the blessed (which no man can number) increases the fruition which each has of God. For every soul, seeing Him in her own way, doubtless communicates that unique vision to all the rest. That, says an old author, is why the Seraphim in Isaiah’s vision are crying “Holy, Holy, Holy” *to one another* (*Isaiah* VI, 3). The more we thus share the Heavenly Bread between us, the more we shall all have.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The homosexual theory therefore seems to me not even plausible. This is not to say that Friendship and abnormal Eros have never been combined. Certain cultures at certain periods seem to have tended to the contamination. In war-like societies it was, I think, especially likely to creep into the relation between the mature Brave and his young armour-bearer or squire. The absence of the women while you were on the war-path had no doubt something to do with it. In deciding, if we think we need or can decide, where it crept in and where it did not, we must surely be guided by the evidence (when there is any) and not by an a *priori* theory. Kisses, tears and embraces are not in themselves evidence of homosexuality. The implications would be, if nothing else, too comic. Hrothgar embracing Beowulf, Johnson embracing Boswell(a pretty flagrantly heterosexual couple) and all those hairy old toughs of centurions in Tacitus, clinging to one another and begging for last kisses when the legion was broken up...all pansies? If you can believe that you can believe anything.

We not only had to do the things, we had to talk about them. We had to plan the hunt and the battle. When they were over we had to hold a *post mortem* and draw conclusions for future use.

And even as a benefactor it would have, not so much survival value, as what we may call “civilisation–value”; would be something (in Aristotelian phrase) which helps the community not to live but to live well. Survival value and civilisation value coincide at some periods and in some circumstances, but not in all. What at any rate seems certain is that when Friendship bears fruit which the community can use it has to do so accidentally, as a by-product. Religions devised for a social purpose, like Roman emperor-worship or modern attempts to “sell” Christianity as a means of “saving civilisation,” do not come to much. The little knots of Friends who turn their backs on the “World” are those who really transform it. Egyptian and Babylonian Mathematics were practical and social, pursued in the service of Agriculture and Magic. But the free Greek Mathematics, pursued by Friends as a leisure occupation, have mattered to us more.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Others again would say that Friendship is extremely useful, perhaps necessary for survival, to the individual. They could produce plenty of authority: “bare is back without brother behind it” and “there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.” But when we speak thus we are using *friend* to mean “ally.” In ordinary usage *friend* means, or should mean, more than that. A Friend will, to be sure, prove himself to be also an ally when alliance becomes necessary; will lend or give when we are in need, nurse us in sickness, stand up for us among our enemies, do what he can for our widows and orphans. But such good offices are not the stuff of Friendship. The occasions for them are almost interruptions. They are in one way relevant to it, in another not. Relevant, because you would be a false friend if you would not do them when the need arose; irrelevant, because the role of benefactor always remains accidental, even a little alien, to that of Friend. It is almost embarrassing. For Friendship is utterly free from Affection’s need to be needed. We are sorry that any gift or loan or night-watching should have been necessary—and now, for heaven’s sake, let us forget all about it and go back to the things we really want to do or talk of together. Even gratitude is no enrichment to this love. The stereotyped “Don’t mention it” here expresses what we really feel. The mark of perfect Friendship is not that help will be given when the pinch comes (of course it will) but that, having been given, it makes no difference at all. It was a distraction, an anomaly. It was a horrible waste of the time, always too short, that we had together. Perhaps we had only a couple of hours in which to talk and, God bless us, twenty minutes of it has had to be devoted to *affairs*!</td></tr>

		<td class="en">For of course we do not want to know our Friend’s affairs at all. Friendship, unlike Eros, is uninquisitive. You become a man’s Friend without knowing or caring whether he is married or single or how he earns his living. What have all these “unconcerning things, matters of fact” to do with the real question, *Do you see the same truth?* In a circle of true Friends each man is simply what he is: stands for nothing but himself. No one cares twopence about any one else’s family, profession, class, income, race, or previous history. Of course you will get to know about most of these in the end. But casually. They will come out bit by bit, to furnish an illustration or an analogy, to serve as pegs for an anecdote; never for their own sake. That is the kingliness of Friendship. We meet like sovereign princes of independent states, abroad, on neutral ground, freed from our contexts. This love (essentially) ignores not only our physical bodies but that whole embodiment which consists of our family, job, past and connections. At home, besides being Peter or Jane, we also bear a general character; husband or wife, brother or sister, chief, colleague or subordinate. Not among our Friends.

Beyond that contrast I do not want the image pressed. The common quest or vision which unites Friends does not absorb them in such a way that they remain ignorant or oblivious of one another. On the contrary it is the very medium in which their mutual love and knowledge exist. One knows nobody so well as one’s “fellow.” Every step of the common journey tests his metal; and the tests are tests we fully understand because we are undergoing them ourselves. Hence, as he rings true time after time, our reliance, our respect and our admiration blossom into an Appreciative love of a singularly robust and well-informed kind. If, at the outset, we had attended more to him and less to the thing our Friendship is “about,” we should not have come to know or love him so well.

Especially when the whole group is together, each bringing out all that is best, wisest, or funniest in all the others.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从我们已经说过的可以清楚地看出，在大多数时期、大多数社会，友爱只出现在男人和男人之间或者女人与女人之间。异性会在慈爱和情爱中接触，但不会是在友爱中，因为他们之间很少拥有在共同活动中的同伴关系，而这种同伴关系是友爱的基质。如果男人受教育而女人没有，某一性别的人工作而另一种性别的人却无所事事，或者他们做完全不同的工作，那么他们通常因为没有共同之处而不能成为朋友。但是，不难看出，异性之间正是由于没有这种共同的东西而非由于各自本性，才导致无法产生友爱的。因为他们只要能成为同伴，就能够成为朋友。因此在男人和女人一起工作的职业中（像我的职业），或在传教场所，或在作家和艺术家之间，常常可以见到这种友爱。可以肯定的是，一方表现出来的友爱可能被另一方误解为情爱，导致痛苦而又令人尴尬的结果。或者二者一开始的友爱也会变成情爱。但是说某事被误认为或者转变为其他东西，并非是要否定它们之间的区别。更确切地说，这暗示了两者的差异，否则我们就不应该说“转变成”或被“误认为”。</td>
		<td class="en">From what has been said it will be clear that in most societies at most periods Friendships will be between men and men or between women and women. The sexes will have met one another in Affection and in Eros but not in this love. For they will seldom have had with each other the companionship in common activities which is the matrix of Friendship. Where men are educated and women not, where one sex works and the other is idle, or where they do totally different work, they will usually have nothing to be Friends about. But we can easily see that it is this lack, rather than anything in their natures, which excludes Friendship; for where they can be companions they can also become Friends. Hence in a profession (like my own) where men and women work side by side, or in the mission field, or among authors and artists, such Friendship is common. To be sure, what is offered as Friendship on one side may be mistaken for Eros on the other, with painful and embarrassing results. Or what begins as Friendship in both may become also Eros. But to say that something can be mistaken for, or turn into, something else is not to deny the difference between them. Rather it implies it; we should not otherwise speak of “turning into” or being “mistaken for.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从某一个方面讲，我们自己的社会是不幸的。一个男女不共同劳作、不共同学习的世界可能会非常和谐地发展下去。在这个世界里，男人们从彼此身上寻找友爱，也只有在彼此身上才行，而且他们非常享受这种友爱。我希望女人们也同样享受她们女性之间的友爱。同样，男人和女人都有充足的共同基础来发展这种友爱关系的世界也能够是和谐的。不过，我们目前却是两头落空。那种必要的共同基础，即基质，在某些群体的异性之间存在，但是在某些群体中却不存在。在许多郊区的居民区很明显缺少这个。在一个富豪居住的小区，男人用尽毕生精力挣钱，至少有一部分女人把闲暇时间花在音乐或文学上，过着一种知性的生活。在这种地方，男人出现在女人中间就像是野蛮人出现在文明人中间一样。在另一个居住区，你会发现整个情形颠倒了过来。的确，不同性别的人都“上过学”。但是后来，男人接受了更加严格的教育，成为了医生、律师、牧师、建筑师、工程师、或作家。女人对他们来说，就像孩子对大人一般。真正异性间的友爱在这两种地区中都是根本不可能存在的。不过，虽然这种情况很可悲，但如果它得到承认和接受，也是可以容忍的。我们这个年代特有的烦恼是，处于这种境地的男女常常苦恼于一些捕风捉影的描述，说存在着某些更幸福的群体，他们中不存在异性间的这种差别。同时，他们还被平等主义的观点折磨着，这种观点认为对某些人可能的东西对所有人也应该是（因此也是）可能的。在这种情形下，他们拒绝对此沉默。因此，一方面，我们看到了像是女教员一样的妻子，那种“有教养”的女人，她总是试图把她的丈夫“提升到她自己的水平”。她把丈夫拉到音乐会，要他学习莫里斯舞蹈，邀请“有教养”的人们到家里来。令人吃惊的是，这对男人往往很少有损害。中年男性具有强大的消极抵抗力和放纵力（但是她不知道）；“女人会有她们的时尚”。有时，当男人受教育而女人却没有，当所有女人，也包括许多男人，都断然拒绝承认这个事实时，会出现更加令人心痛的事情。</td>
		<td class="en">In one respect our own society is unfortunate. A world where men and women never have common work or a common education can probably get along comfortably enough. In it men turn to each other, and only to each other, for Friendship, and they enjoy it very much. I hope the women enjoy their feminine Friends equally. Again, a world where all men and women had sufficient common ground for this relationship could also be comfortable. At present, however, we fall between two stools. The necessary common ground, the matrix, exists between the sexes in some groups but not in others. It is notably lacking in many residential suburbs. In a plutocratic neighbourhood where the men have spent their whole lives in acquiring money some at least of the women have used their leisure to develop an intellectual life—have become musical or literary. In such places the men appear among the women as barbarians among civilised people. In another neighbourhood you will find the situation reversed. Both sexes have, indeed, “been to school.” But since then the men have had a much more serious education; they have become doctors, lawyers, clergymen, architects, engineers, or men of letters. The women are to them as children to adults. In neither neighbourhood is real Friendship between the sexes at all probable. But this, though an impoverishment, would be tolerable if it were admitted and accepted. The peculiar trouble of our own age is that men and women in this situation, haunted by rumours and glimpses of happier groups where no such chasm between the sexes exists, and bedevilled by the egalitarian idea that what is possible for some ought to be (and therefore is) possible to all, refuse to acquiesce in it. Hence, on the one hand, we get the wife as school-marm, the “cultivated” woman who is always trying to bring her husband “up to her level.” She drags him to concerts and would like him to learn morris-dancing and invites “cultivated” people to the house. It often does surprisingly little harm. The middle-aged male has great powers of passive resistance and (if she but knew) of indulgence; “women will have their fads.” Something much more painful happens when it is the men who are civilised and the women not, and when all the women, and many of the men too, simply refuse to recognise the fact.</td></tr>

The fact—in itself not important—that they now smoke and drink like the men seems to simple-minded people a proof that they really are. No stag-parties are allowed. Wherever the men meet, the women must come too. The men have learned to live among ideas. They know what discussion, proof and illustration mean. A woman who has had merely school lessons and has abandoned soon after marriage whatever tinge of “culture” they gave her—whose reading is the Women’s Magazines and whose general conversation is almost wholly narrative—cannot really enter such a circle. She can be locally and physically present with it in the same room. What of that? If the men are ruthless, she sits bored and silent through a conversation which means nothing to her. If they are better bred, of course, they try to bring her in. Things are explained to her: people try to sublimate her irrelevant and blundering observations into some kind of sense. But the efforts soon fail and, for manners’ sake, what might have been a real discussion is deliberately diluted and peters out in gossip, anecdotes, and jokes. Her presence has thus destroyed the very thing she was brought to share. She can never really enter the circle because the circle ceases to be itself when she enters it—as the horizon ceases to be the horizon when you get there. By learning to drink and smoke and perhaps to tell *risqué* stories, she has not, for this purpose, drawn an inch nearer to the men than her grandmother. But her grandmother was far happier and more realistic. She was at home talking real women’s talk to other women and perhaps doing so with great charm, sense and even wit. She herself might be able to do the same. She may be quite as clever as the men whose evening she has spoiled, or cleverer.

Affection is taken as the image when God is represented as our Father; Eros, when Christ is represented as the Bridegroom of the Church.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >让我们以上司对部下之间的友爱的怀疑开始。我认为那些怀疑是有原因的，而且考虑到这种原因会有一些重要的发现。我曾说过，友爱诞生在这样一个时刻：当一个人对另一个人说“什么！你也这样？我还以为就我一个人这样呢……”但是那种因此而发现的共同的兴趣、梦想或观点未必总是美好的。从这一刻起，艺术、哲学、宗教或道德上的进步或许会发展起来；但是为什么不会是迫害、自相残杀、或人类的牺牲呢？想必我们中的大多数人在我们年轻时都曾对这一刻的矛盾特性有所体会吧？我们第一次见到另一个人也喜欢我们最欣赏的诗人是很美好的事情。我们在这之前很难理解的东西，现在却清晰可见了。我们曾略微感到羞耻的事情，现在我们却坦率地承认了。但是，第一次见到同我们分享一个秘密的邪念的人时，我们同样会感到高兴。这也变得更加的明显和清晰；对此，我们也不再感到羞耻。即使现在，不管什么年纪，我们都清楚共同的憎恨或怨恨带来的危险的吸引力。（对学院里那个唯一能够像你一样真正看出学监的错误的人，你很难不高兴地把他当作朋友。）</td>
		<td class="en">Let us begin with the suspicions of those in Authority. I think there is a ground for them and that a consideration of this ground brings something important to light. Friendship, I have said, is born at the moment when one man says to another “What! You too? I thought that no one but myself ...” But the common taste or vision or point of view which is thus discovered need not always be a nice one. From such a moment art, or philosophy, or an advance in religion or morals might well take their rise; but why not also torture, cannibalism, or human sacrifice? Surely most of us have experienced the ambivalent nature of such moments in our own youth? It was wonderful when we first met someone who cared for our favourite poet. What we had hardly understood before now took clear shape. What we had been half ashamed of we now freely acknowledged. But it was no less delightful when we first met someone who shared with us a secret evil. This too became far more palpable and explicit; of this too, we ceased to be ashamed. Even now, at whatever age, we all know the perilous charm of a shared hatred or grievance. (It is difficult not to hail as a Friend the only other man in College who really sees the faults of the Sub-Warden.)</td></tr>

Put me back among my Friends and in half an hour—in ten minutes—these same views and standards become once more indisputable. The opinion of this little circle, while I am in it, outweighs that of a thousand outsiders: as Friendship strengthens, it will do this even when my Friends are far away. For we all wish to be judged by our peers, by the men “after our own heart.” Only they really know our mind and only they judge it by standards we fully acknowledge. Theirs is the praise we really covet and the blame we really dread. The little pockets of early Christians survived because they cared exclusively for the love of “the brethren” and stopped their ears to the opinion of the Pagan society all round them. But a circle of criminals, cranks, or perverts survives in just the same way; by becoming deaf to the opinion of the outer world, by discounting it as the chatter of outsiders who “don’t understand,” of the “conventional,” “the bourgeois,” the “Establishment,” of prigs, prudes and humbugs.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">It is therefore easy to see why Authority frowns on Friendship. Every real Friendship is a sort of secession, even a rebellion. It may be a rebellion of serious thinkers against accepted clap-trap or of faddists against accepted good sense; of real artists against popular ugliness or of charlatans against civilised taste; of good men against the badness of society or of bad men against its goodness. Whichever it is, it will be unwelcome to Top People. In each knot of Friends there is a sectional “public opinion” which fortifies its members against the public opinion of the community in general. Each therefore is a pocket of potential resistance. Men who have real Friends are less easy to manage or “get at”; harder for good Authorities to correct or for bad Authorities to corrupt. Hence if our masters, by force or by propaganda about “Togetherness” or by unobtrusively making privacy and unplanned leisure impossible, ever succeed in producing a world where all are Companions and none are Friends, they will have removed certain dangers, and will also have taken from us what is almost our strongest safeguard against complete servitude.</td></tr>

The founders of meteorology rightly and inevitably ignored the views of the millions who still attributed storms to witchcraft. There is no offence in this.

		<td class="en">The danger is that this partial indifference or deafness to outside opinion, justified and necessary though it is, may lead to a wholesale indifference or deafness. The most spectacular instances of this can be seen not in a circle of Friends but in a Theocratic or aristocratic class. We know what the Priests in Our Lord’s time thought of the common people. The Knights in Froissart’s *Chronicles* had neither sympathy nor mercy for the “outsiders,” the churls or peasantry. But this deplorable indifference was very closely intertwined with a good quality. They really had, among themselves, a very high standard of valour, generosity, courtesy and honour. This standard the cautious, close-fisted churl would have thought merely silly. The Knights, in maintaining it, were, and had to be, wholly indifferent to his views. They “didn’t give a damn” what he thought. If they had, our own standard today would be the poorer and the coarser for it. But the habit of “not giving a damn” grows on a class. To discount the voice of the peasant where it really ought to be discounted makes it easier to discount his voice when he cries for justice or mercy. The partial deafness which is noble and necessary encourages the wholesale deafness which is arrogant and inhuman.</td></tr>

It can come to treat as “outsiders” in a general (and derogatory) sense those who were quite properly outsiders for a particular purpose. Thus, like an aristocracy, it can create around it a vacuum across which no voice will carry. The literary or artistic circle which began by discounting, perhaps rightly, the plain man’s ideas about literature or art may come to discount equally his idea that they should pay their bills, cut their nails and behave civilly. Whatever faults the circle has—and no circle is without them—thus become incurable. But that is not all. The partial and defensible deafness was based on some kind of superiority—even if it were only a superior knowledge about stamps.

We seek men after our own heart for their own sake and are then alarmingly or delightfully surprised by the feeling that we have become an aristocracy. Not that we’d call it that. Every reader who has known Friendship will probably feel inclined to deny with some heat that his own circle was ever guilty of such an absurdity. I feel the same.

I asked how there could be any uncreated things except God if the Creed was right in calling Him the “maker of all things visible and invisible.” Their reply was to glance at one another and laugh. I had no objection to their laughter, but I wanted an answer in words as well. It was not at all a sneering or unpleasant laugh. It expressed very much what Americans would express by saying “Isn’t he cute?” It was like the laughter of jolly grown-ups when an *enfant terrible* asks the sort of question that is never asked. You can hardly imagine how inoffensively it was done, nor how clearly it conveyed the impression that they were fully aware of living habitually on a higher plane than the rest of us, of coming among us as Knights among churls or as grown-ups among children. Very possibly they had an answer to my question and knew that I was too ignorant to follow it. If they had said in so many words “I’m afraid it would take too long to explain,” I would not be attributing to them the pride of Friendship. The glance and the laugh are the real point—the audible and visible embodiment of a corporate superiority taken for granted and unconcealed. The almost complete inoffensiveness, the absence of any apparent wish to wound or exult (they were very nice young men) really underline the Olympian attitude. Here was a sense of superiority so secure that it could afford to be tolerant, urbane, unemphatic.</td></tr>

Twice in the last five minutes you have as good as called me a liar. If you cannot discuss a question of criticism without that kind of thing I must leave.” I expected he would do one of two things; lose his temper and redouble his insults, or else blush and apologise. The startling thing is that he did neither. No new perturbation was added to the habitual *malaise* of his expression. He did not repeat the Lie Direct; but apart from that he went on just as before. One had come up against an iron curtain. He was forearmed against the risk of any strictly personal relation, either friendly or hostile, with such as me. Behind this, almost certainly, there lies a circle of the Titanic sort—self-dubbed Knights Templars perpetually in arms to defend a critical Baphomet.

We have all seen this done by the “old hands” at school talking in the presence of a new boy, or two Regulars in the Army talking before a “Temporary”; sometimes by very loud and vulgar friends to impress mere strangers in a bar or a railway carriage. Such people talk very intimately and esoterically in order to be overheard. Everyone who is not in the circle must be shown that he is not in it.

In speaking to an Outsider each member of it delights to mention the others by their Christian names or nick-names; not although, but because, the Outsider won’t know who he means. A man I once knew was even subtler. He simply referred to his friends as if we all knew, certainly ought to know, who they were. “As Richard Button once said to me…,” he would begin. We were all very young. We never dared to admit that we hadn’t heard of Richard Button. It seemed so obvious that to everyone who was anyone he must be a household word; “not to know him argued ourselves unknown.” Only much later did we come to realise that no one else had heard of him either.

The other loves do not invite the same illusion. Affection obviously requires kinships or at least proximities which never depended on our own choice. And as for Eros, half the love songs and half the love poems in the world will tell you that the Beloved is your fate or destiny, no more your choice than a thunderbolt, for “it is not in our power to love or hate.” Cupid’s archery, genes—anything but ourselves. But in Friendship, being free of all that, we think we have chosen our peers. In reality, a few years’ difference in the dates of our births, a few more miles between certain houses, the choice of one university instead of another, posting to different regiments, the accident of a topic being raised or not raised at a first meeting—any of these chances might have kept us apart. But, for a Christian, there are, strictly speaking, no chances. A secret Master of the Ceremonies has been at work. Christ, who said to the disciples “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you,” can truly say to every group of Christian friends “You have not chosen one another but I have chosen you for one another.” The Friendship is not a reward for our discrimination and good taste in finding one another out. It is the instrument by which God reveals to each the beauties of all the others. They are no greater than the beauties of a thousand other men; by Friendship God opens our eyes to them. They are, like all beauties, derived from Him, and then, in a good Friendship, increased by Him through the Friendship itself, so that it is His instrument for creating as well as for revealing. At this feast it is He who has spread the board and it is He who has chosen the guests. It is He, we may dare to hope, who sometimes does, and always should, preside.

		<td class="en">By Eros I mean of course that state which we call “being in love”; or, if you prefer, that kind of love which lovers are “in.” Some readers may have been surprised when, in an earlier chapter, I described Affection as the love in which our experience seems to come closest to that of the animals. Surely, it might be asked, our sexual functions bring us equally close? This is quite true as regards human sexuality in general. But I am not going to be concerned with human sexuality simply as such. Sexuality makes part of our subject only when it becomes an ingredient in the complex state of “being in love.” That sexual experience can occur without Eros, without being “in love,” and that Eros includes other things besides sexual activity, I take for granted. If you prefer to put it that way, I am inquiring not into the sexuality which is common to us and the beasts or even common to all men but into one uniquely human variation of it which develops within “love”—what I call Eros. The carnal or animally sexual element within Eros, I intend (following an old usage) to call Venus. And I mean by Venus what is sexual not in some cryptic or rarefied sense—such as a depth-psychologist might explore—but in a perfectly obvious sense; what is known to be sexual by those who experience it; what could be proved to be sexual by the simplest observations.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Sexuality may operate without Eros or as part of Eros. Let me hasten to add that I make the distinction simply in order to limit our inquiry and without any moral implications. I am not at all subscribing to the popular idea that it is the absence or presence of Eros which makes the sexual act “impure” or “pure,” degraded or fine, unlawful or lawful. If all who lay together without being in the state of Eros were abominable, we all come of tainted stock. The times and places in which marriage depends on Eros are in a small minority. Most of our ancestors were married off in early youth to partners chosen by their parents on grounds that had nothing to do with Eros. They went to the act with no other “fuel,” so to speak, than plain animal desire. And they did right; honest Christian husbands and wives, obeying their fathers and mothers, discharging to one another their “marriage debt,” and bringing up families in the fear of the Lord. Conversely, this act, done under the influence of a soaring and iridescent Eros which reduces the role of the senses to a minor consideration, may yet be plain adultery, may involve breaking a wife’s heart, deceiving a husband, betraying a friend, polluting hospitality and deserting your children. It has not pleased God that the distinction between a sin and a duty should turn on fine feelings. This act, like any other, is justified (or not) by far more prosaic and definable criteria; by the keeping or breaking of promises, by justice or injustice, by charity or selfishness, by obedience or disobedience. My treatment rules out mere sexuality—sexuality without Eros—on grounds that have nothing to do with morals; because it is irrelevant to our purpose.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">To the evolutionist Eros (the human variation) will be something that grows out of Venus, a late complication and development of the immemorial biological impulse. We must not assume, however, that this is necessarily what happens within the consciousness of the individual. There may be those who have first felt mere sexual appetite for a woman and then gone on at a later stage to “fall in love with her.” But I doubt if this is at all common. Very often what comes first is simply a delighted pre-occupation with the Beloved—a general, unspecified pre-occupation with her in her totality. A man in this state really hasn’t leisure to think of sex. He is too busy thinking of a person. The fact that she is a woman is far less important than the fact that she is herself. He is full of desire, but the desire may not be sexually toned. If you asked him what he wanted, the true reply would often be, “To go on thinking of her.” He is love’s contemplative. And when at a later stage the explicitly sexual element awakes, he will not feel (unless scientific theories are influencing him) that this had all along been the root of the whole matter. He is more likely to feel that the incoming tide of Eros, having demolished many sand-castles and made islands of many rocks, has now at last with a triumphant seventh wave flooded this part of his nature also—the little pool of ordinary sexuality which was there on his beach before the tide came in. Eros enters him like an invader, taking over and reorganizing, one by one, the institutions of a conquered country. It may have taken over many others before it reaches the sex in him; and it will reorganize that too.</td></tr>

We use a most unfortunate idiom when we say, of a lustful man prowling the streets, that he “wants a woman.” Strictly speaking, a woman is just what he does not want. He wants a pleasure for which a woman happens to be the necessary piece of apparatus. How much he cares about the woman as such may be gauged by his attitude to her five minutes after fruition (one does not keep the carton after one has smoked the cigarettes). Now Eros makes a man really want, not a woman, but one particular woman. In some mysterious but quite indisputable fashion the lover desires the Beloved herself, not the pleasure she can give. No lover in the world ever sought the embraces of the woman he loved as the result of a calculation, however unconscious, that they would be more pleasurable than those of any other woman. If he raised the question he would, no doubt, expect that this would be so. But to raise it would be to step outside the world of Eros altogether. The only man I know of who ever did raise it was Lucretius, and he was certainly not in love when he did. It is interesting to note his answer. That austere voluptuary gave it as his opinion that love actually impairs sexual pleasure. The emotion was a distraction. It spoiled the cool and critical receptivity of his palate.

		<td class="en">It has been widely held in the past, and is perhaps held by many unsophisticated people to-day, that the spiritual danger of Eros arises almost entirely from the carnal element within it; that Eros is “noblest” or “purest” when Venus is reduced to the minimum. The older moral theologians certainly seem to have thought that the danger we chiefly had to guard against in marriage was that of a soul-destroying surrender to the senses. It will be noticed, however, that this is not the Scriptural approach. St. Paul, dissuading his converts from marriage, says nothing about that side of the matter except to discourage prolonged abstinence from Venus (I *Cor.* VII, 5). What he fears is pre-occupation, the need of constantly “pleasing”—that is, considering—one’s partner, the multiple distractions of domesticity. It is marriage itself, not the marriage bed, that will be likely to hinder us from waiting uninterruptedly on God. And surely St. Paul is right? If I may trust my own experience, it is (within marriage as without) the practical and prudential cares of this world, and even the smallest and most prosaic of those cares, that are the great distraction. The gnat-like cloud of petty anxieties and decisions about the conduct of the next hour have interfered with my prayers more often than any passion or appetite whatever. The great, permanent temptation of marriage is not to sensuality but (quite bluntly) to avarice. With all proper respect to the medieval guides, I cannot help remembering that they were all celibates, and probably did not know what Eros does to our sexuality; how, far from aggravating, he reduces the nagging and addictive character of mere appetite. And that not simply by satisfying it. Eros, without diminishing desire, makes abstinence easier. He tends, no doubt, to a pre-occupation with the Beloved which can indeed be an obstacle to the spiritual life; but not chiefly a sensual pre-occupation.</td></tr>

It is a useful, sturdy, lazy, obstinate, patient, lovable and infuriating beast; deserving now the stick and now a carrot; both pathetically and absurdly beautiful. So the body. There’s no living with it till we recognise that one of its functions in our lives is to play the part of buffoon. Until some theory has sophisticated them, every man, woman and child in the world knows this. The fact that we have bodies is the oldest joke there is. Eros (like death, figure-drawing, and the study of medicine) may at moments cause us to take it with total seriousness. The error consists in concluding that Eros should always do so and permanently abolish the joke. But this is not what happens. The very faces of all the happy lovers we know make it clear. Lovers, unless their love is very short-lived, again and again feel an element not only of comedy, not only of play, but even of buffoonery, in the body’s expression of Eros. And the body would frustrate us if this were not so. It would be too clumsy an instrument to render love’s music unless its very clumsiness could be felt as adding to the total experience its own grotesque charm—a sub-plot or antimasque miming with its own hearty rough-and-tumble what the soul enacts in statelier fashion. (Thus in old comedies the lyric loves of the hero and heroine are at once parodied and corroborated by some much more earthy affair between a Touchstone and an Audrey or a valet and a chambermaid.) The highest does not stand without the lowest. There is indeed at certain moments a high poetry in the flesh itself; but also, by your leave, an irreducible element of obstinate and ludicrous un-poetry.

In us all the masculinity and femininity of the world, all that is assailant and responsive, are momentarily focused. The man does play the Sky-Father and the woman the Earth-Mother; he does play Form, and she Matter. But we must give full value to the word *play*.

		<td class="en">Some will think it strange I should find an element of ritual or masquerade in that action which is often regarded as the most real, the most unmasked and sheerly genuine, we ever do. Are we not our true selves when naked? In a sense, no. The word naked was originally a past participle; the *naked* man was the man who had undergone a process of *naking*, that is, of stripping or peeling (you used the verb of nuts and fruit). Time out of mind the naked man has seemed to our ancestors not the natural but the abnormal man; not the man who has abstained from dressing but the man who has been for some reason undressed. And it is a simple fact—anyone can observe it at a men’s bathing place—that nudity emphasises common humanity and soft-pedals what Is Individual. In that way we are “more ourselves” when clothed. By nudity the lovers cease to be solely John and Mary; the universal He and She are emphasised. You could almost say they *put* on nakedness as a ceremonial robe—or as the costume for a charade. For we must still beware—and never more than when we thus partake of the Pagan sacrament in our love-passages—of being serious in the wrong way. The Sky-Father himself is only a Pagan dream of One far greater than Zeus and far more masculine than the male. And a mortal man is not even the Sky- Father, and cannot really wear his crown. Only a copy of it, done in tinselled paper. I do not call it this in contempt. I like ritual; I like private theatricals; I even like charades.

		<td class="en">But I dare not mention this Pagan sacrament without turning aside to guard against any danger of confusing it with an incomparably higher mystery. As nature crowns man in that brief action, so the Christian law has crowned him in the permanent relationship of marriage, bestowing—or should I say, inflicting?—a certain “headship” on him. This is a very different coronation. And as we could easily take the natural mystery too seriously, so we might take the Christian mystery not seriously enough. Christian writers (notably Milton) have sometimes spoken of the husband’s headship with a complacency to make the blood run cold. We must go back to our Bibles. The husband is the head of the wife just in so far as he is to her what Christ is to the Church. He is to love her as Christ loved the Church—read on—*and give his life for her* (*Eph. V*, 25). This headship, then, is most fully embodied not in the husband we should all wish to be but in him whose marriage is most like a crucifixion; whose wife receives most and gives least, is most unworthy of him, is—in her own mere nature—least lovable. For the Church has no beauty but what the Bride-groom gives her; he does not find, but makes her, lovely. The chrism of this terrible coronation is to be seen not in the joys of any man’s marriage but in its sorrows, in the sickness and sufferings of a good wife or the faults of a bad one, in his unwearying (never paraded) care or his inexhaustible forgiveness: forgiveness, not acquiescence. As Christ sees in the flawed, proud, fanatical or lukewarm Church on earth that Bride who will one day be without spot or wrinkle, and labours to produce the latter, so the husband whose headship is Christ-like (and he is allowed no other sort) never despairs. He is a King Cophetua who after twenty years still hopes that the beggar-girl will one day learn to speak the truth and wash behind her ears.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">From Venus, the carnal ingredient within Eros, I now turn to Eros as a whole. Here we shall see the same pattern repeated. As Venus within Eros does not really aim at pleasure, so Eros does not aim at happiness. We may think he does, but when he is brought to the test it proves otherwise. Everyone knows that it is useless to try to separate lovers by proving to them that their marriage will be an unhappy one. This is not only because they will disbelieve you. They usually will, no doubt. But even if they believed, they would not be dissuaded. For it is the very mark of Eros that when he is in us we had rather share unhappiness with the Beloved than be happy on any other terms. Even if the two lovers are mature and experienced people who know that broken hearts heal in the end and can clearly foresee that, if they once steeled themselves to go through the present agony of parting, they would almost certainly be happier ten years hence than marriage is at all likely to make them—even then, they would not part. To Eros all these calculations are irrelevant—just as the coolly brutal judgment of Lucretius is irrelevant to Venus. Even when it becomes clear beyond all evasion that marriage with the Beloved can not possibly lead to happiness—when it cannot even profess to offer any other life than that of tending an incurable invalid, of hopeless poverty, of exile, or of disgrace—Eros never hesitates to say, “Better this than parting. Better to be miserable with her than happy without her. Let our hearts break provided they break together.” If the voice within us does not say this, it is not the voice of Eros.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">There have been schools of thought which accepted the voice of Eros as something actually transcendent and tried to justify the absoluteness of his commands. Plato will have it that “falling in love” is the mutual recognition on earth of souls which have been singled out for one another in a previous and celestial existence. To meet the Beloved is to realise “We loved before we were born.” As a myth to express what lovers feel this is admirable. But if one accepted it literally one would be faced by an embarrassing consequence. We should have to conclude that in that heavenly and forgotten life affairs were no better managed than here.

		<td class="en">A theory more likely to be accepted in our own day is what we may call Shavian—Shaw himself might have said “metabiological”—Romanticism. According to Shavian Romanticism the voice of Eros is the voice of the *élan vital* or Life Force, the “evolutionary appetite.” In overwhelming a particular couple it is seeking parents (or ancestors) for the superman. It is indifferent both to their personal happiness and to the rules of morality because it aims at something which Shaw thinks very much more important: the future perfection of our species. But if all this were true it hardly makes clear whether—and if so, why—we should obey it. All pictures yet offered us of the superman are so unattractive that one might well vow celibacy at once to avoid the risk of begetting him. And secondly, this theory surely leads to the conclusion that the Life Force does not very well understand its (or her? or his?) own business. So far as we can see the existence or intensity of Eros between two people is no warrant that their offspring will be especially satisfactory, or even that they will have offspring at all. Two good “strains” (in the stockbreeders’ sense), not two good lovers, is the recipe for fine children. And what on earth was the Life Force doing through all those countless generations when the begetting of children depended very little on mutual Eros and very much on arranged marriages, slavery, and rape? Has it only just thought of this bright idea for improving the species?</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Neither the Platonic nor the Shavian type of erotic transcendentalism can help a Christian. We are not worshippers of the Life Force and we know nothing of previous existences. We must not give unconditional obedience to the voice of Eros when he speaks most like a god. Neither must we ignore or attempt to deny the god-like quality. This love is really and truly like Love Himself. In it there is a real nearness to God (by Resemblance); but not, therefore and necessarily, a nearness of Approach. Eros, honoured so far as love of God and charity to our fellows will allow, may become for us a means of Approach. His total commitment is a paradigm or example, built into our natures, of the love we ought to exercise towards God and Man. As nature, for the nature-lover, gives a content to the word *glory*, so this gives a content to the word *Charity*. It is as if Christ said to us through Eros, “Thus—just like this—with this prodigality—not counting the cost—you are to love me and the least of my brethren.” Our conditional honour to Eros will of course vary with our circumstances. Of some a total renunciation (but not a contempt) is required. Others, with Eros as their fuel and also as their model, can embark on the married life. Within which Eros, of himself, will never be enough—will indeed survive only in so far as he is continually chastened and corroborated by higher principles.</td></tr>

So does the Affection in which Eros is almost invariably clothed. Even in courtship I question whether anyone who has felt the thirst for the Uncreated, or even dreamed of feeling it, ever supposed that the Beloved could satisfy it. As a fellow-pilgrim pierced with the very same desire, that is, as a Friend, the Beloved may be gloriously and helpfully relevant; but as an object for it—well (I would not be rude), ridiculous.

The idolatry I speak of can be seen in the popular misinterpretation of Our Lord’s words “Her sins, which are many, are forgiven her, for she loved much” (*Luke* VII, 47). From the context, and especially from the preceding parable of the debtors, it is clear that this must mean: “The greatness of her love for Me is evidence of the greatness of the sins I have forgiven her.” (The *for* here is like *the* for in “He can’t have gone out,*for* his hat is still hanging in the hall”; the presence of the hat is not the cause of his being in the house but a probable proof that he is). But thousands of people take it quite differently. They first assume, with no evidence, that her sins were sins against chastity, though, for all we know, they may have been usury, dishonest shop keeping, or cruelty to children. And they then take Our Lord to be saying, “I forgive her unchastity because she was so much in love.” The implication is that a great Eros extenuates—almost sanctions— almost sanctifies—any actions it leads to.</td></tr>

He builds his own religion round the lovers. Benjamin Constant has noticed how he creates for them, in a few weeks or months, a joint past which seems to them immemorial. They recur to it continually with wonder and reverence, as the Psalmists recur to the history of Israel. It is in fact the Old Testament of Love’s religion; the record of love’s judgments and mercies towards his chosen pair up to the moment when they first knew they were lovers.

If you want to see the difference between its contribution and the gardener’s, put the commonest weed it grows side by side with his hoes, rakes, shears, and packet of weed killer; you have put beauty, energy and fecundity beside dead, sterile things. Just so, our “decency and common sense” show grey and deathlike beside the geniality of love. And when the garden is in its full glory the gardener’s contributions to that glory will still have been in a sense paltry compared with those of nature. Without life springing from the earth, without rain, light and heat descending from the sky, he could do nothing. When he has done all, he has merely encouraged here and discouraged there, powers and beauties that have a different source. But his share, though small, is indispensable and laborious. When God planted a garden He set a man over it and set the man under Himself. When He planted the garden of our nature and caused the flowering, fruiting loves to grow there, He set our will to “dress” them. Compared with them it is dry and cold. And unless His grace comes down, like the rain and the sunshine, we shall use this tool to little purpose. But its laborious—and largely negative—services are indispensable. If they were needed when the garden was still Paradisal, how much more now when the soil has gone sour and the worst weeds seem to thrive on it best? But heaven forbid we should work in the spirit of prigs and Stoics. While we hack and prune we know very well that what we are hacking and pruning is big with a splendour and vitality which our rational will could never of itself have supplied. To liberate that splendour, to let it become fully what it is trying to be, to have tall trees instead of scrubby tangles, and sweet apples instead of crabs, is part of our purpose.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But only part. For now we must face a topic that I have long postponed. Hitherto hardly anything has been said in this book about our natural loves as rivals to the love of God. Now the question can no longer be avoided. There were two reasons for my delay.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个原因是——我已经暗示出来了——我们大多数人不需要从这个问题入手。一开始，它就很少“切合我们的处境”。对于我们大多数人而言，真正的对手存在于自我和他者之间，而不是存在于他者和上帝之间。当一个人真正的困难在于其尘世之爱尚且不够，把超越尘世之爱的责任强加到他身上，是很危险的。较少地爱我们的同类还幻想这是因为我们正学着去更多地爱上帝，毫无疑问这是非常容易的，但真正的原因可能完全不是这样。我们或许仅仅把“人类本性的衰退错当成了美德的增加”。许多人并不觉得憎恨他们自己的妻子或母亲真的那么难。在一幕杰出的戏剧场景中，莫里亚克描绘了其他门徒对上帝这个奇怪的诫命感到惊讶和迷惑，但犹大没有。他欣然接受了。</td>
		<td class="en">One—already hinted—is that this question is not the place at which most of us need begin. It is seldom, at the outset, “addressed to our condition.” For most of us the true rivalry lies between the self and the human Other, not yet between the human Other and God. It is dangerous to press upon a man the duty of getting beyond earthly love when his real difficulty lies in getting so far. And it is no doubt easy enough to love the fellow-creature less and to imagine that this is happening because we are learning to love God more, when the real reason may be quite different. We may be only “mistaking the decays of nature for the increase of Grace.” Many people do not find it really difficult to hate their wives or mothers. M. Mauriac, in a fine scene, pictures the other disciples stunned and bewildered by this strange command, but not Judas. He laps it up easily.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是从另一个方面讲，如果这本书较早地强调这种敌对关系也将会是草率的。轻率地宣称我们的爱具备神性，这种说法无需我们如此深刻地讨论也会被驳倒。这些爱证明它们是不配去取代上帝的，因为事实是，没有上帝的帮助，它们甚至不能保持自身，或完成它们所承诺的事情。一个没有了皇帝的支持，甚至无法保全自己较低一等的王位，连小省半年的和平都维持不了的小王子，我们有何必要去证明他不是合法的皇帝呢？即使为了它们自己的缘故，如果想要继续保持它们想要保持的特性，这些爱必须屈从于次要的地位。它们真实的自由存在于这种束缚中；它们“鞠躬时会更高大”。因为当上帝在人的心里占统治地位时，尽管有时不得不完全去除一些他本有的权威，但是他经常继续在这些地方保持他其他的权威，而且，通过让它们的权威屈服于自己的权威，上帝第一次赋予它一个坚实的基础。爱默生说过：“半神半人消失了以后，神灵就到了。”这是一个非常令人怀疑的格言。更好的说法是：“当上帝来临（而且只有那时），半神半人才能够继续存在”。让他们自己决定，他们要么消失，要么变成魔鬼。只有以上帝之名，他们才能够带着美好和安全“挥舞他们小小的三叉戟”。反叛性的标语“一切为了爱”事实上却是爱的死亡令（只是处死的日期暂时还未确定）。</td>
		<td class="en">But to have stressed the rivalry earlier in this book would have been premature in another way also. The claim to divinity which our loves so easily make can be refuted without going so far as that. The loves prove that they are unworthy to take the place of God by the fact that they cannot even remain themselves and do what they promise to do without God’s help. Why prove that some petty princeling is not the lawful Emperor when without the Emperor’s support he cannot even keep his subordinate throne and make peace in his little province for half a year? Even for their own sakes the loves must submit to be second things if they are to remain the things they want to be. In this yoke lies their true freedom; they “are taller when they bow.” For when God rules in a human heart, though He may sometimes have to remove certain of its native authorities altogether, he often continues others in their offices and, by subjecting their authority to His, gives it for the first time a firm basis. Emerson has said, “When half-gods go, the gods arrive.” That is a very doubtful maxim. Better say, “When God arrives (and only then) the half-gods can remain.” Left to themselves they either vanish or become demons. Only in His name can they with beauty and security “wield their little tridents.” The rebellious slogan “All for love” is really love’s death warrant (date of execution, for the moment, left blank).</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >竞争的问题，由于以上原因而拖延了这么久，现在必须加以探讨。在以往任何时期，除了十九世纪，关于爱的书自始至终都突出竞争这一主题。如果维多利亚时代的人需要有人提醒说爱是不够的，那么更老的神学家总是大声地说（自然的）爱可能太多了。对我们同伴的爱太少了这一危险相比于像崇拜偶像一样爱他们的危险，他们考虑更多的是后者。在每个妻子、母亲、孩子和朋友身上，他们看到了上帝的可能的对手。当然我们的上帝也看到了（《路加福音》，10：26）。</td>
		<td class="en">But the question of the rivalry, for these reasons long postponed, must now be treated. In any earlier period, except the nineteenth century, it would have loomed large throughout a book on this subject. If the Victorians needed the reminder that love is not enough, older theologians were always saying very loudly that (natural) love is likely to be a great deal too much. The danger of loving our fellow-creatures too little was less present to their minds than that of loving them idolatrously. In every wife, mother, child and friend they saw a possible rival to God.

Who could even include it among the grounds for loving? Would you choose a wife or a Friend—if it comes to that, would you choose a dog—in this spirit?

Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket—safe, dark, motionless, airless—it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable.

		<td class="en">I believe that the most lawless and inordinate loves are less contrary to God’s will than a self-invited and self-protective lovelessness. It is like hiding the talent in a napkin and for much the same reason. “I knew thee that thou wert a hard man.” Christ did not teach and suffer that we might become, even in the natural loves, more careful of our own happiness. If a man is not uncalculating towards the earthly beloveds whom he has seen, he is none the more likely to be so towards God whom he has not. We shall draw nearer to God, not by trying to avoid the sufferings inherent in all loves, but by accepting them and offering them to Him; throwing away all defensive armour.

		<td class="en">It remains certainly true that all natural loves can be inordinate. *Inordinate* does not mean “insufficiently cautious.” Nor does it mean “too big.” It is not a quantitative term. It is probably impossible to love any human being simply “too much.” We may love him too much *in proportion* to our love for God; but it is the smallness of our love for God, not the greatness of our love for the man, that constitutes the inordinacy. But even this must be refined upon. Otherwise we shall trouble some who are very much on the right road but alarmed because they cannot feel towards God so warm a sensible emotion as they feel for the earthly Beloved. It is much to be wished—at least I think so—that we all, at all times, could. We must pray that this gift should be given us. But the question whether we are loving God or the earthly Beloved “more” is not, so far as concerns our Christian duty, a question about the comparative intensity of two feelings.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是我们该如何理解*恨*这个词呢？上帝之爱竟然命令我们做通常用恨来表达的事——命令我们珍爱憎恨的感情，嘲笑其他人的苦难，为伤害他而感到高兴——这几乎是一种明确的矛盾。我认为基督说“退到我后边去吧”时，从这里所暗含的意义上讲，他“恨”圣彼特。恨一个人就是当所爱的人，不管多么甜蜜、多么可怜地说出恶魔般的建议时，要拒绝，要坚决反对，不做任何让步。耶稣说，一个人要想服务于两个主人，将会“恨”其中一个而“爱”另一个。可以肯定地说，这里谈论的不仅是憎恨和喜欢的情感。他会忠于、赞成、效力于其中一个而不顾另一个。再考虑一下这句话，“我爱雅各布，我*恨*以扫”（《玛拉基书》，1：2-3）。被称为上帝对以扫的*恨*是如何表现在真实的故事中的呢？一点儿都不像我们可能预料的那样。当然没有任何理由假定以扫没有好的结局，并且成了一个迷失的灵魂；《圣经·旧约》关于这一点和其他地方一样，对于这些事情都没有解释。而且就我们所知，以扫的尘世生活，从每一个普通意义上讲，都远远比雅各布的生活受到更多的祝福。正是雅各布有着一切的失望、羞耻、恐惧和丧亲之痛。但他也拥有以扫所没有的一些东西。他是元老。他将希伯来人的传统延续下来，传递上帝的使命和祝福，成为基督的先辈。对雅各布的“爱”似乎意味着为了更高的使命而接受雅各布；对以扫的“恨”，是对他的拒绝。他被“拒绝”，没有“达到需要的标准”，他在达到目的上被认为是无用的。所以最终我们必须拒绝我们最亲近的人或者取消他们的资格，一旦他们夹在我们和我们对上帝的顺从之间时。天知道，这在他们看来完全就像是恨。我们不能按照我们感觉到的怜悯行事；我们必须对眼泪视而不见，对恳求充耳不闻。</td>
		<td class="en">But how are we to understand the word *hate*? That Love Himself should be commanding what we ordinarily mean by hatred—commanding us to cherish resentment, to gloat over another’s misery, to delight in injuring him—is almost a contradiction in terms. I think Our Lord, in the sense here intended, “hated” St. Peter when he said, “Get thee behind me.” To hate is to reject, to set one’s face against, to make no concession to, the Beloved when the Beloved utters, however sweetly and however pitiably, the suggestions of the Devil. A man, said Jesus, who tries to serve two masters, will “hate” the one and “love” the other. It is not, surely, mere feelings of aversion and liking that are here in question. He will adhere to, consent to, work for, the one and not for the other. Consider again, “I loved Jacob and I *hated* Esau” (Malachi I, 2-3). How is the thing called God’s “hatred” of Esau displayed in the actual story? Not at all as we might expect. There is of course no ground for assuming that Esau made a bad end and was a lost soul; the Old Testament, here as elsewhere, has nothing to say about such matters. And, from all we are told, Esau’s earthly life was, in every ordinary sense, a good deal more blessed than Jacob’s. It is Jacob who has all the disappointments, humiliations, terrors, and bereavements. But he has something which Esau has not. He is a patriarch. He hands on the Hebraic tradition, transmits the vocation and the blessing, becomes an ancestor of Our Lord. The “loving” of Jacob seems to mean the acceptance of Jacob for a high (and painful) vocation; the “hating” of Esau, his rejection. He is “turned down,” fails to “make the grade,” is found useless for the purpose. So, in the last resort, we must turn down or disqualify our nearest and dearest when they come between us and our obedience to God. Heaven knows, it will seem to them sufficiently like hatred. We must not act on the pity we feel; we must be blind to tears and deaf to pleadings.</td></tr>

He does not need to “hate” her, to set his face against her, for he and she acknowledge the same law. They have agreed and understood each other on this matter long before. The task of converting her to a belief in Honour is not now—now, when the decision is upon them—to be undertaken. It is this prior agreement which is so necessary when a far greater claim than that of Honour is at stake. It is too late, when the crisis comes, to begin telling a wife or husband or mother or friend, that your love all along had a secret reservation—“under God” or “so far as a higher Love permits.” They ought to have been warned; not, to be sure, explicitly, but by the implication of a thousand talks, by the principle revealed in a hundred decisions upon small matters. Indeed, a real disagreement on this issue should make itself felt early enough to prevent a marriage or a Friendship from existing at all. The best love of either sort is not blind. Oliver Elton, speaking of Carlyle and Mill, said that they differed about justice, and that such a difference was naturally fatal “to any friendship worthy of the name.” If “All”—quite seriously all—“for love” is implicit in the Beloved’s attitude, his or her love is not worth having.

We begin at the real beginning, with love as the Divine energy. This primal love is Gift-love. In God there is no hunger that needs to be filled, only plenteousness that desires to give. The doctrine that God was under no necessity to create is not a piece of dry scholastic speculation. It is essential. Without it we can hardly avoid the conception of what I can only call a “managerial” God; a Being whose function or nature is to “run” the universe, who stands to it as a head-master to a school or a hotelier to a hotel. But to be sovereign of the universe is no great matter to God. In Himself, at home in “the land of the Trinity,” he is Sovereign of a far greater realm. We must keep always before our eyes that vision of Lady Julian’s in which God carried in His hand a little object like a nut, and that nut was “all that is made.” God, who needs nothing, loves into existence wholly superfluous creatures in order that He may love and perfect them. He creates the universe, already foreseeing—or should we say “seeing”? there are no tenses in God—the buzzing cloud of flies about the cross, the flayed back pressed against the uneven stake, the nails driven through the mesial nerves, the repeated incipient suffocation as the body droops, the repeated torture of back and arms as it is time after time, for breath’s sake, hitched up. If I may dare the biological image, God is a “host” who deliberately creates His own parasites; causes us to be that we may exploit and “take advantage of” Him. Herein is love. This is the diagram of Love Himself, the inventor of all loves.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">God, as Creator of nature, implants in us both Gift-loves and Need-loves. The Gift-loves are natural images of Himself; proximities to Him by resemblance which are not necessarily and in all men proximities of approach. A devoted mother, a beneficent ruler or teacher, may give and give, continually exhibiting the likeness, without making the approach. The Need-loves, so far as I have been able to see, have no resemblance to the Love which God is. They are rather correlatives, opposites; not as evil is the opposite of good, of course, but as the form of the blancmange is an opposite to the form of the mould.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >上帝给人一份自己的赠予之爱。这与上帝早已根植于人的本性中的赠予之爱是不同的。这些本性中的赠予之爱绝不会仅仅为了对象自身的利益而为被爱对象谋求好处。他们倾向于他们自己能够给予的好处，或者是那些他们自己最想要的好处，或者偏爱那些其生活符合他们的预先规划的被爱对象。但神圣的赠予之爱——在人身上起作用的上帝之爱——对这些完全不感兴趣，它只渴望那些对所爱之物最有用的东西。再者，自然的赠予之爱永远是关注一些物体，喜欢的人觉得这些物体从某种方式上讲本身就非常可爱——那些物体吸引他的地方是慈爱、情爱或一个共同的看法，或者如果这些地方不吸引他，就会吸引感恩的人和应受奖赏的人，或许还会吸引到那些无助的人，他们引人注意，赢得同情。但是在人身上的上帝的赠予之爱可以让他爱本来不可爱的人：麻风病人、罪犯、敌人、蠢人、坏脾气的人、自命不凡的人、嘲笑别人的人。最后，通过复杂的自相矛盾，上帝使得人拥有一种对上帝的赠予之爱。当然，认为没有人可以给上帝任何不是上帝已经有了的东西是有一定道理的；而如果它早已是上帝的，那么你给了他什么呢？但是既然我们已经很明显能够从上帝那里保留我们自己，保留我们的意志和心灵，从那种意义上讲，我们也能够献出这些。原本属于上帝的东西，如果不再属于他，就不会再存在（就像歌曲是属于歌唱家的），虽然如此，上帝也已经通过这样一个方式创造了我们的东西，以至于我们能够自由地把它献回给上帝。“为了使他们成为你的，我们的意志是我们的。”正如所有的基督徒都知道的，仍有另一种献给上帝的方式；我们给饭吃或者给衣服穿的每个陌生人都是基督。很明显的，无论我们知道与否，这就是对上帝的赠予之爱。上帝之爱能够在那些对上帝一无所知的人们身上起作用。在寓言中的“绵羊”，对隐藏在那些他们曾访问过的囚犯中的上帝或者对他们访问时隐藏在他们自身当中的上帝都一无所知。（我把整个寓言当作是对异教徒的审判。因为在希腊语中它开始说的是，上帝将会召集“万民”来到他的面前——大概是那些异邦人，即那些*外邦人*。）</td>
		<td class="en">He communicates to men a share of His own Gift-love. This is different from the Gift-loves He has built into their nature. These never quite seek simply the good of the loved object for the object’s own sake. They are biased in favour of those goods they can themselves bestow, or those which they would like best themselves, or those which fit in with a pre-conceived picture of the life they want the object to lead. But Divine Gift-love—Love Himself working in a man—is wholly disinterested and desires what is simply best for the beloved. Again, natural Gift-love is always directed to objects which the lover finds in some way intrinsically lovable—objects to which Affection or Eros or a shared point of view attracts him, or, failing that, to the grateful and the deserving, or perhaps to those whose helplessness is of a winning and appealing kind. But Divine Gift-love in the man enables him to love what is not naturally lovable; lepers, criminals, enemies, morons, the sulky, the superior and the sneering. Finally, by a high paradox, God enables men to have a Gift-love towards Himself. There is of course a sense in which no one can give to God anything which is not already His; and if it is already His what have you given? But since it is only too obvious that we can withhold ourselves, our wills and hearts, from God, we can, in that sense, also give them. What is His by right and would not exist for a moment if it ceased to be His (as the song is the singer’s), He has nevertheless made ours in such a way that we can freely offer it back to Him. “Our wills are ours to make them Thine.” And as all Christians know there is another way of giving to God; every stranger whom we feed or clothe is Christ. And this apparently is Gift-love to God whether we know it or not. Love Himself can work in those who know nothing of Him. The “sheep” in the parable had no idea either of the God hidden in the prisoner whom they visited or of the God hidden in themselves when they made the visit. (I take the whole parable to be about the judgment of the heathen. For it begins by saying, in the Greek, that the Lord will summon all “the nations” before Him—presumably, the Gentiles, the *Goyim*.)</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >每个人都会同意，这种来自上帝恩典的赠予之爱应该被称作仁爱。但是我不得不加些东西，这些东西或许不会如此简单地得到认可。在我看来上帝给予了两份其他的礼物；一种是对上帝的超自然的需求之爱，另一种是对彼此的超自然的需求之爱。谈到第一种需求之爱，我不是指对上帝的欣赏之爱，即崇拜的礼物。对那个更高级的（实际上是最高级的）话题，我要说的非常少，将会在后面展开。我指的是这样一种爱，它不会梦想公正无私，那不过是无尽的贫穷。就像一条小河自己开凿了河道，就像一杯魔幻的酒，当被倒出来时，它同时创造了那个要盛酒的玻璃杯，上帝把我们对他的需要转化成了对他的需求之爱。更加奇怪的是上帝赋予我们一种超乎自然的对来自同伴的仁爱的接纳能力。需求是如此的接近贪婪而且我们已经如此贪婪以至于贪婪似乎是一种奇怪的美德。但是我不能从我脑海里去除这种想法：这就是所发生的事情。</td>
		<td class="en">That such a Gift-love comes by Grace and should be called Charity, everyone will agree. But I have to add something which will not perhaps be so easily admitted. God, as it seems to me, bestows two other gifts; a supernatural Need-love of Himself and a supernatural Need-love of one another. By the first I do not mean the Appreciative love of Himself, the gift of adoration. What little I have to say on that higher—that highest—subject will come later. I mean a love which does not dream of disinterestedness, a bottomless indigence. Like a river making its own channel, like a magic wine which in being poured out should simultaneously create the glass that was to hold it, God turns our need of Him into Need-love of Him. What is stranger still is that He creates in us a more than natural receptivity of Charity from our fellow-men. Need is so near greed and we are so greedy already that it seems a strange grace. But I cannot get it out of my head that this is what happens.</td></tr>

No sooner do we believe that God loves us than there is an impulse to believe that He does so, not because He is Love, but because we are intrinsically lovable. The Pagans obeyed this impulse unabashed; a good man was “dear to the gods” because he was good. We, being better taught, resort to subterfuge. Far be it from us to think that we have virtues for which God could love us. But then, how magnificently we have repented! As Bunyan says, describing his first and illusory conversion, “I thought there was no man in England that pleased God better than I.” Beaten out of this, we next offer our own humility to God’s admiration. Surely He’ll like *that*? Or if not that, our clear-sighted and humble recognition that we still lack humility. Thus, depth beneath depth and subtlety within subtlety, there remains some lingering idea of our own, our very own, attractiveness. It is easy to acknowledge, but almost impossible to realise for long, that we are mirrors whose brightness, if we are bright, is wholly derived from the sun that shines upon us. Surely we must have a little—however little—native luminosity? Surely we can’t be *quite* creatures?</td></tr>

		<td class="en">For this tangled absurdity of a Need, even a Need-love, which never fully acknowledges its own neediness, Grace substitutes a full, childlike and delighted acceptance of our Need, a joy in total dependence.

And he is not sorry at all for the innocent Need that is inherent in his creaturely condition. For all the time this illusion to which nature clings as her last treasure, this pretence that we have anything of our own or could for one hour retain by our own strength any goodness that God may pour into us, has kept us from being happy. We have been like bathers who want to keep their feet—or one foot—or one toe—on the bottom, when to lose that foothold would be to surrender themselves to a glorious tumble in the surf.

The first hint that anyone is offering us the highest love of all is a terrible shock. This is so well recognised that spiteful people will pretend to be loving us with Charity precisely because they know that it will wound us. To say to one who expects a renewal of Affection, Friendship, or Eros, “I forgive you as a Christian” is merely a way of continuing the quarrel. Those who say it are of course lying.

		<td class="en">How difficult it is to receive, and to go on receiving, from others a love that does not depend on our own attraction can be seen from an extreme case. Suppose yourself a man struck down shortly after marriage by an incurable disease which may not kill you for many years; useless, impotent, hideous, disgusting; dependent on your wife’s earnings; impoverishing where you hoped to enrich; impaired even in intellect and shaken by gusts of uncontrollable temper, full of unavoidable demands. And suppose your wife’s care and pity to be inexhaustible. The man who can take this sweetly, who can receive all and give nothing without resentment, who can abstain even from those tiresome self-depreciations which are really only a demand for petting and reassurance, is doing something which Need-love in its merely natural condition could not attain. (No doubt such a wife will also be doing something beyond the reach of a natural Gift-love, but that is not the point at present.) In such a case to receive is harder and perhaps more blessed than to give. But what the extreme example illustrates is universal. We are all receiving Charity. There is something in each of us that can not be naturally loved. It is no one’s fault if they do not so love it. Only the lovable can be naturally loved. You might as well ask people to like the taste of rotten bread or the sound of a mechanical drill. We can be forgiven, and pitied, and loved in spite of it, with Charity; no other way. All who have good parents, wives, husbands, or children, may be sure that at some times—and perhaps at all times in respect of some one particular trait or habit—they are receiving Charity, are loved not because they are lovable but because Love Himself is in those who love them.</td></tr>

This is of course not the only thing that can happen. He may come on what seems to us a more dreadful mission and demand that a natural love be totally renounced. A high and terrible vocation, like Abraham’s, may constrain a man to turn his back on his own people and his father’s house. Eros, directed to a forbidden object, may have to be sacrificed. In such instances, the process, though hard to endure, is easy to understand.

		<td class="en">One difficulty is that here, as usual, we can take a wrong turn. A Christian—a somewhat too vocally Christian—circle or family, having grasped this principle, can make a show, in their overt behaviour and especially in their words, of having achieved the thing itself—an elaborate, fussy, embarrassing and intolerable show. Such people make every trifle a matter of explicitly spiritual importance—out loud and to one another (to God, on their knees, behind a closed door, it would be another matter). They are always unnecessarily asking, or insufferably offering, forgiveness. Who would not rather live with those ordinary people who get over their tantrums (and ours) unemphatically, letting a meal, a night’s sleep, or a joke mend all? The real work must be, of all our works, the most secret. Even as far as possible secret from ourselves. Our right hand must not know what our left is doing. We have not got far enough if we play a game of cards with the children “merely” to amuse them or to show that they are forgiven. If this is the best we can do we are right to do it.

		<td class="en">We are, however, much helped in this necessary work by that very feature of our experience at which we most repine. The invitation to turn our natural loves into Charity is never lacking. It is provided by those frictions and frustrations that meet us in all of them; unmistakable evidence that (natural) love is not going to be “enough”—unmistakable, unless we are blinded by egotism. When we are, we use them absurdly. “If only I had been more fortunate in my children (that boy gets more like his father every day) I could have loved them perfectly.” But every child is sometimes infuriating; most children are not infrequently odious. “If only my husband were more considerate, less lazy, less extravagant” ... “If only my wife had fewer moods and more sense, and were less extravagant” ... “If my father wasn’t so infernally prosy and close-fisted.” But in everyone, and of course in ourselves, there is that which requires forbearance, tolerance, forgiveness. The necessity of practising these virtues first sets us, forces us, upon the attempt to turn—more strictly, to let God turn—our love into Charity. These frets and rubs are beneficial. It may even be that where there are fewest of them the conversion of natural love is most difficult. When they are plentiful the necessity of rising above it is obvious. To rise above it when it is as fully satisfied and as little impeded as earthly conditions allow—to see that we must rise when all seems so well already—this may require a subtler conversion and a more delicate insight. In this way also it may be hard for “the rich” to enter the Kingdom.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过，我相信，这种转化的必要性是不可改变的。至少，如果我们的自然之爱要进入天堂的生活中，就会是这样；它们能够进入天堂，事实上我们大多数人都相信这一点。我们或许希望肉体的复活也意味着我们所说的“更伟大肉体”的复活；即我们一般尘世生命构造的复活，连带着它的情感和关系。但是仅仅在一个条件下；不是上帝随意规定的一个条件，而必须是在天堂的特征中所固有的一个条件：不能成为神圣的东西都不会进入天堂。“血肉之躯”，纯粹的自然，不能继承那个王国。人能够升入天堂，仅仅是因为已经死去并升入天堂的基督是“在他身上形成的”。难道我们不能设想人的爱也是同样的吗？只有那些被上帝之爱渗入的爱才会升华为上帝之爱。只有当他们从某种程度和形式上与基督共担死亡；当他们身上的自然因素已经年复一年地被消磨殆尽了，或者经过某种突然的创伤而变化了，这些才能够和基督一起被升华。这个世界的方式才会消失。自然这个名字意味着暂时性。自然之爱希望永恒，仅仅当它们已经允许自己被带到仁爱的永恒之中时才行；至少是已经允许这个过程在尘世这里开始，在没有人能工作的黑夜来临之前。这个过程将永远含有一种死亡。无一例外。在我对妻子或朋友的爱中，唯一永恒的元素是向上帝之爱转化的存在。通过这种存在，其他的元素如果有什么希望的话，它们或许希望，就像我们的肉体所希望的，是从死亡中复活。因为只这一点在他们身上是神圣的，只这一点是上帝。</td>
		<td class="en">And yet, I believe, the necessity for the conversion is inexorable; at least, if our natural loves are to enter the heavenly life. That they can enter it most of us in fact believe. We may hope that the resurrection of the body means also the resurrection of what may be called our “greater body”; the general fabric of our earthly life with its affections and relationships. But only on a condition; not a condition arbitrarily laid down by God, but one necessarily inherent in the character of Heaven: nothing can enter there which cannot become heavenly. “Flesh and blood,” mere nature, cannot inherit that Kingdom. Man can ascend to Heaven only because the Christ, who died and ascended to Heaven, is “formed in him.” Must we not suppose that the same is true of a man’s loves? Only those into which Love Himself has entered will ascend to Love Himself. And these can be raised with Him only if they have, in some degree and fashion, shared His death; if the natural element in them has submitted—year after year, or in some sudden agony—to transmutation. The fashion of this world passes away. The very name of nature implies the transitory. Natural loves can hope for eternity only in so far as they have allowed themselves to be taken into the eternity of Charity; have at least allowed the process to begin here on earth, before the night comes when no man can work. And the process will always involve a kind of death. There is no escape. In my love for wife or friend the only eternal element is the transforming presence of Love Himself. By that presence, if at all, the other elements may hope, as our physical bodies hope, to be raised from the dead. For this only is holy in them, this only is the Lord.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >神学家有时问我们是否会在天堂里“认识彼此”，以及在尘世中存在的独特的爱的关系到那里是否会继续具有意义。这样回答似乎是合理的：“这或许取决于它在尘世曾变成，或者将会变成何种爱。”因为，可以肯定的是，在永恒的世界里碰见那个人，而你在这里对他的爱，无论多么强烈，都仅仅是自然之爱，因此这甚至都称不上是一件令人感兴趣的事情。你在成年的时候，遇到小学时由于共同的兴趣或业余活动，而似乎成为你好朋友的人，这难道不像是那种情形吗？如果没有更多的东西，如果他和你是不同血缘，那么他现在就将成为一个完全陌生的人。你们两个人现在谁都不玩康克戏。你不再想要他用法语练习作业来换取你的帮助，用你的算术作业来换取他的帮助。在天堂里，我怀疑，那种从未体现上帝之爱的爱将同样是无关紧要的。因为自然已经消失了。所有非永恒的东西都已经永远过时了。</td>
		<td class="en">Theologians have sometimes asked whether we shall “know one another” in Heaven, and whether the particular love-relations worked out on earth would then continue to have any significance. It seems reasonable to reply: “It may depend what kind of love it had become, or was becoming, on earth.” For, surely, to meet in the eternal world someone for whom your love in this, however strong, had been merely natural, would not be (on that ground) even interesting. Would it not be like meeting in adult life someone who had seemed to be a great friend at your preparatory school solely because of common interests and occupations? If there was nothing more, if he was not a kindred soul, he will now be a total stranger. Neither of you now plays conkers. You no longer want to swop your help with his French exercise for his help with your arithmetic. In Heaven I suspect, a love that had never embodied Love Himself would be equally irrelevant. For Nature has passed away. All that is not eternal is eternally out of date.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是我不能以这种语调来结束这本书，我不敢——至少是因为我自己的渴望和恐惧促使我这样做的——使任何丧失亲人和孤独的读者同意这普遍的幻想，即与已经过世的爱人重聚是基督徒生活的目标。否定这个或许在那些心碎的人听起来很刺耳且不真实，但是这必须要否定。</td>
		<td class="en">But I must not end on this note, I dare not—and all the less because longings and terrors of my own prompt me to do so—leave any bereaved and desolate reader confirmed in the widespread illusion that reunion with the loved dead is the goal of the Christian life. The denial of this may sound harsh and unreal in the ears of the broken hearted, but it must be denied.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你为了你自己创造了我们”，圣奥古斯丁说，“而我们的心却没有停息，直到它走向你。”在圣坛前面，或者在四月的小树林里半祈祷、半沉思的时候，这还容易使人相信一会儿，但在一个临终的人旁边听起来就像是嘲弄。但是我们会更加真实地被嘲弄，如果我们放弃这种方式，把安慰寄托于将来某天，再次与尘世所爱的人一起享受快乐，永不分离，除此之外，不再想别的——甚至可能借助于降神会和召魂术。很难让人不去想象这样一种无限延长的尘世幸福将会使人完全地满足。</td>
		<td class="en">“Thou hast made us for thyself,” said St. Augustine, “and our heart has no rest till it comes to Thee.” This, so easy to believe for a brief moment before the altar or, perhaps, half-praying, half-meditating in an April wood, sounds like mockery beside a deathbed. But we shall be far more truly mocked if, casting this way, we pin our comfort on the hope—perhaps even with the aid of *séance* and necromancy—of some day, this time forever, enjoying the earthly Beloved again, and no more. It is hard not to imagine that such an endless prolongation of earthly happiness would be completely satisfying.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，如果我可以相信自己的经验，我们会立刻得到一个严厉的警告说某些方面是错的。我们试图为了这个目的在另一个世界里使用我们的信仰的时候，那种信仰就会变弱。在我生命里信仰的确很强烈的那些时刻都正是上帝在我的思想中占核心地位的时候。相信上帝，那么我就能够把天堂当作一个必然的结果来相信。但是反过来——首先相信与爱人的重聚，接着为了重聚而相信有天堂，最后，因为天堂而相信上帝——这是行不通的。一个人当然能胡思乱想，但是一个自我批判的人不久就会不断意识到是他自己的幻想正在起作用；他知道他只是在编织一个幻想。思维较简单的灵魂会发现，他们所依赖的幻象缺少安慰和营养，只能通过可怜的自我催眠，或者卑劣的图画、诗歌、（更糟的是）巫术，才能激发出来些微真实。</td>
		<td class="en">But, if I may trust my own experience, we get at once a sharp warning that there is something wrong. The moment we attempt to use our faith in the other world for this purpose, that faith weakens. The moments in my life when it was really strong have all been moments when God Himself was central in my thoughts. Believing in Him, I could then believe in Heaven as a corollary. But the reverse process—believing first in reunion with the Beloved, and then, for the sake of that reunion, believing in Heaven, and finally, for the sake of Heaven, believing in God—this will not work. One can of course imagine things. But a self-critical person will soon be increasingly aware that the imagination at work is his own; he knows he is only weaving a fantasy. And simpler souls will find the phantoms they try to feed on void of all comfort and nourishment, only to be stimulated into some semblance of reality by pitiful efforts of self-hypnotism, and perhaps by the aid of ignoble pictures and hymns and (what is worse) witches.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因此我们通过经验发现，将尘世的安慰应用到天堂是没有好处的。天堂能够给予天堂的安慰；不能给其他的安慰。然而尘世也并不能给予尘世的安慰。不存在长久的尘世的安慰。</td>
		<td class="en">We find thus by experience that there is no good applying to Heaven for earthly comfort. Heaven can give heavenly comfort; no other kind. And earth cannot give earthly comfort either. There is no earthly comfort in the long run.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因为，在一个纯粹由人类的爱组成的天堂里找到我们被创造出来的目的的梦想不可能成真，除非我们整个信仰都是错误的。我们为上帝而被创造。仅仅通过从某些方面像上帝，仅仅通过成为上帝美丽、慈爱、智慧或美德的表现形式，任何尘世的爱人才激发了我们的爱。不是我们太爱他们了，而是我们不太明白我们所爱的是什么。不是上帝要求我们离开这样熟悉的爱人，而转向一个陌生人。当我们看到了上帝的面孔，我们就会知道我们一直是认识他的。他一直是我们在尘世中经历的纯真之爱的一部分，一直创造，保持这些经验并且不停地在里面活动。他们里面所有真实的爱，即便在尘世也是上帝的而不是我们的，之所以是我们的也仅仅因为是他的。在天堂里，将不会有背弃我们尘世里的爱人所要受的痛苦和承担的责任。首先，因为我们早已离开了；从画像转到本人，从溪流转到泉眼，从他创造的可爱的生物转到上帝本身。第二，因为我们会发现他们都存在于上帝本身之中。通过爱上帝多于爱他们，我们将比现在更爱他们。</td>
		<td class="en">For the dream of finding our end, the thing we were made for, in a Heaven of purely human love could not be true unless our whole Faith were wrong. We were made for God. Only by being in some respect like Him, only by being a manifestation of His beauty, lovingkindness, wisdom or goodness, has any earthly Beloved excited our love. It is not that we have loved them too much, but that we did not quite understand what we were loving. It is not that we shall be asked to turn from them, so dearly familiar, to a Stranger. When we see the face of God we shall know that we have always known it. He has been a party to, has made, sustained and moved moment by moment within, all our earthly experiences of innocent love. All that was true love in them was, even on earth, far more His than ours, and ours only because His. In Heaven there will be no anguish and no duty of turning away from our earthly Beloveds. First, because we shall have turned already; from the portraits to the Original, from the rivulets to the Fountain, from the creatures He made lovable to Love Himself. But secondly, because we shall find them all in Him. By loving Him more than them we shall love them more than we now do.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，所有那些都远在“三位一体的领地里”，而不在这里，不在哭泣的山谷里，不在被放逐的途中。在这尘世里，全都是丧亲和抛弃。丧亲的目的（它至今也影响着我们）可能已经强加于我们身上了。然后我们被迫努力去相信我们尚无法感觉到的东西，即相信上帝是我们真正所爱的人。这就是为何丧亲从某些方面对非信徒要比对我们更容易接受。非信徒能够咆哮、大发脾气、对宇宙挥拳，而且（如果他是个天才）会写出像豪斯曼和哈代一样的诗歌。但是我们，在最低潮的时候，当最少的努力对我们来说看起来都是太多的时候，我们必须开始去尝试那些看上去不可能的东西。</td>
		<td class="en">But all that is far away in “the land of the Trinity,” not here in exile, in the weeping valley. Down here it is all loss and renunciation. The very purpose of the bereavement (so far as it affects ourselves) may have been to force this upon us. We are then compelled to try to believe, what we cannot yet feel, that God is our true Beloved. That is why bereavement is in some ways easier for the unbeliever than for us. He can storm and rage and shake his fist at the universe, and (if he is a genius) write poems like Housman’s or Hardy’s. But we, at our lowest ebb, when the least effort seems too much for us, must begin to attempt what seem impossibilities.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“爱上帝容易吗？”一位老作家问道。“是很简单的，”他回答说，“对于那些爱上帝的人。”我使用的仁爱这个词包含上帝的两个恩典。但是上帝能够给出第三个。他能唤醒人对他的一种超自然的欣赏之爱。这是人类在所有礼物中最渴望得到的。这种欣赏之爱，不是在我们的自然之爱里，甚至也不是在道德规范里，而是存在于所有人和天使生活的真正中心。有了这个，一切皆有可能。</td>
		<td class="en">“Is it easy to love God?” asks an old author. “It is easy,” he replies, “to those who do it.” I have included two Graces under the word Charity. But God can give a third. He can awake in man, towards Himself, a supernatural Appreciative love. This is of all gifts the most to be desired. Here, not in our natural loves, nor even in ethics, lies the true centre of all human and angelic life. With this all things are possible.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一本更好的书会从这里开始，而我的书必须在这里结束。我不敢再继续写下去了。上帝知道，而我不知道，我是否已经品尝过了这种爱。或许我仅仅是想象曾经品尝过吧。那些像我一样拥有的想象力远远超过他们的顺从的人们，会易于受到公正的惩罚；我们能够轻易地想象远远高于我们能够真正达到的境界。如果把想象过的东西描绘出来，我们或许会使其他人，还有我们自己相信，我们真的曾经到过那里。如果我仅仅想象过这个，这是不是一个错觉呢？那种想象甚至曾在某些时候使得所有其他的欲望——是的，甚至是和平、甚至是不再恐惧——看起来像是破碎的玩具和凋零的花朵。或许吧。或许，对我们中的很多人来说，所有的体验不过是解释了（可以这么说）我们对上帝的爱是何等的欠缺。这是不够的。但这种体验有它的意义。如果我们不能“体验到上帝的存在”，那么体验上帝的不存在也是有意义的，我们逐渐意识到自己的无意识，直到我们感觉到自己像是站在一个巨大的瀑布旁边，却听不到任何声音；或者像一个故事里的人，朝镜子里看却看不到脸，或者像一个梦中的人，伸手去抓能看到的东西却没有触摸的感觉。知道一个人在做梦，就不再完全是沉睡。但是要想知道完全清醒的世界的消息，你必须向比我更好的人请教。</td>
		<td class="en">And with this, where a better book would begin, mine must end. I dare not proceed. God knows, not I, whether I have ever tasted this love. Perhaps I have only imagined the tasting. Those like myself whose imagination far exceeds their obedience are subject to a just penalty; we easily imagine conditions far higher than any we have really reached. If we describe what we have imagined we may make others, and make ourselves, believe that we have really been there. And if I have only imagined it, is it a further delusion that even the imagining has at some moments made all other objects of desire—yes, even peace, even to have no more fears—look like broken toys and faded flowers? Perhaps. Perhaps, for many of us, all experience merely defines, so to speak, the shape of that gap where our love of God ought to be. It is not enough. It is something. If we cannot “practice the presence of God,” it is something to practice the absence of God, to become increasingly aware of our unawareness till we feel like men who should stand beside a great cataract and hear no noise, or like a man in a story who looks in a mirror and finds no face there, or a man in a dream who stretches out his hand to visible objects and gets no sensation of touch. To know that one is dreaming is to be no longer perfectly asleep. But for news of the fully waking world you must go to my betters. </td></tr>
