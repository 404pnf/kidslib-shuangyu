		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >**梁**：谈到我跟蒋，我要从头说起了。还比较早的时候，我在山东做我的乡村建设工作。刚好啊，蒋本人住在武汉，他叫做“剿匪总司令部”——“匪”嘛就是共产党。因为他自己驻军在武汉，他就把武汉省政府改组，原来的省政府他认为不大满意，他就改组。改组嘛，他就用一个姓朱的，叫做朱经农，也是留美的，学教育的。他就改组湖北省政府，湖北省政府里头有教育厅了，他就用这个朱经农做湖北教育厅厅长。可是朱呢，原来是在山东济南做齐鲁大学的校长，齐鲁大学是个教会办的学校，所以他需要辞齐鲁大学校长，来接任湖北教育厅长，所以他就从武汉回济南。回济南的时候，蒋就对朱经农说：“你认不认识那个梁某某人呢？”朱说：“认识呀。”他说：“你替我说一句话，希望梁到武汉来跟我见面。”那么这个朱经农他回去，到济南交卸齐鲁大学校长，在济南看到我，他就把蒋的话传达给我。我说：“好，我知道了。”但是我不去，我不能够因为他派人传这么一句话，我就自己去呀，我不去。这是头一次。</td>
		<td class="en">**Liang**: If we are going to talk about Chiang Kai-shek and me, we must start from an earlier period. I was in Shandong doing rural reconstruction at the time that Chiang was in Wuhan in what he called his Bandit Extermination General Headquarters. The “bandits” referred to the Communist Party. As he was stationing troops in Wuhan, he reorganized the Wuhan Provincial Government. He wasn’t very satisfied with the original administration, [so he] had Zhu Jingnong appointed as the Superintendent of Education for Hubei. Zhu had studied in the U.S., and had specialized in education. But Zhu was the president of Cheeloo (Qilu) University in Jinan, Shandong. A church ran this university. He had to resign his position as president and then take up the position as Superintendent of Education. So, he went from Wuhan back to Jinan. Chiang asked him if he knew Liang Shuming. Zhu answered that he did know me. Chiang said, “When you go back to Jinan, ask him to come to Wuhan to meet me.” Zhu returned to Jinan and resigned his university presidency. He saw me in Jinan, and relayed Chiang’s invitation to me. I told him, “OK, I have the message.” But I didn’t go. I couldn’t bring myself to go just because he had sent someone with this one sentence. This was the first contact that I had with Chiang.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >后来，刚好在南京开第二届内政会议，讨论全国的内政，这个是归南京的内政部召集的。这个时候内政会议的部长是广西人，叫黄绍。那么他很想办一件新的，采取新的方针、新的政策，他就要搞在乡村建设之上的、而又包含乡村建设的，他叫做县政建设——一个县，县以下是乡村了，所以是县政建设，县政建设是包含乡村建设的。所以他开这个内政会议要提出这个方案来，就把我们搞乡村建设的人——也包含了我，包含了我们山东的朋友，还包含了晏阳初——都找到南京来，作为是一种专家，参加他那个内政会议，来把县政建设的计划搞好。这个时候我到了南京了，为这个事情到了南京了。</td>
		<td class="en">I had contact with him next in Nanjing, when the Second Interior AffairsConference was held to discuss the internal affairs of the whole nation. The Ministry of Interior Affairs convened this conference. The Minister was a Guangxi native, Huang Shaohong. He was eager to adopt innovative and new programs and policies. He wanted to use measures superior to and also inclusive of rural reconstruction, which he called county government reconstruction. This would include the county level and the countryside below the county. At this conference he presented his plans. So he invited me and my colleagues working in Shandong, as well as Yan Yangchu, to attend as specialists this conference in Nanjing to help his program of county government reconstruction. So, because of this matter I traveled to Nanjing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >到了南京呢，这个时候的南京市的市长是我一个老朋友。这个人（指石瑛）是老资格，他跟孙中山是朋友，岁数很大，比我们都大，他是一个在清朝已经中了清朝的举人的，念那个老书啊，中了举人的。中了举人呢，年纪还很轻，他只有19岁，他又到英国去留学，到英国去留学，学化学；学化学回来之后，蔡元培蔡先生请他在北京大学做教授，做理科化学教授。他在国外很帮助孙中山，跟孙中山是一辈的老朋友。这个时候做南京市的市长，跟我也是朋友，我们在北京大学在一起。他到中央饭店、旅馆来看我，他说：你既然到了南京了，以前蒋介石想跟你见面你不去，那你到了南京了，你不可以不跟他见面了。我说好，那么这个样子他作为市长跟蒋的秘书、副官通电话，约好了时间，某一天的晚上，事先是坐着汽车接我一同到“委员长官邸”，去跟蒋见面。这个时候是我第一次跟蒋见面。</td>
		<td class="en">At that time, the mayor of Nanjing city was an old friend of mine. This man [Shi Ying], was a veteran, an old friend of Sun Yat-sen’s. He was old, quite a bit older than I. When only 19 years old, he won the *Juren*degree, and after that studied chemistry in England. Mr. Cai Yuanpei engaged him as a professor of chemistry at Peking University. He had helped Sun Yat-sen while abroad, an old friend of Sun’s. At the time he was mayor of Nanjing city, and also a friend of mine, since we had both been teaching at Peking University. Mr. Shi came to see me at the Central Hotel [where I was staying]. He said, “Chiang Kai-shek had wanted to meet you and you didn’t come. Now that you are already here in Nanjing, you must see him.” I answered that I would see him. Mr. Shi was mayor, so later he called Chiang’s secretary to arrange a time, the evening of a certain day. Mr. Shi came in his car to pick me up for the appointment at Chiang’s official residence. This was the first time I met Chiang Kai-shek.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可一见面我印象就不好。怎么样不好呢？就是他虚假。他不是以前因为我的有名，要和我见面，要我去我又不去？这次嘛，石先生陪着我来看他了，约好了见面了，他怎么样子虚假呢？他就手里拿一个笔，也是自来水笔，手里拿个本子，谈话的时候——当然随便谈了，我不知道我怎么样子提起来，那个时候啊江北——江苏北部，包括安徽——有水灾，灾情很重，我一个朋友就在那儿做救灾工作，不知道怎样提到这个事情。提到这个事情，我就提到负责救灾工作的那个人的名字了，他就说：“哦？很好，你这个朋友叫什么名字啊？”他把那个本子、笔递给我：“你写下来。”我当然给他写下来了。他这个人就看出来有一种虚假，虚假就是“谦恭下士”，很谦恭的样子：你的话我很注意，你说那个人名，你写给我看。自己拿着本子、自己拿着笔，好像听不清楚，你再写一下。其实他另外有个秘书啊，坐得稍微远一点，也记了，不一定他再记。大体上说这次是头一次见面，头一次见面就是我感觉他虚假。</td>
		<td class="en">Even from the very outset, at this first meeting, I didn’t like him. Why? He was insincere and false. He had heard, he said, that I was very famous and had wanted to meet me. He wanted me to come see him, but I had been unwilling. This time Mr. Shi had made the arrangements and brought me to see him, and so on. How was he insincere and false? He held a pen in his hand—a fountain pen, and also a little notebook. When we were talking—naturally we were just talking at random—I do not remember how I happened to bring it up, that at the time the Jiangbei area—northern part of Jiangsu and part of Anhui—had suffered a great flood, and the damage was quite heavy. A friend of mine was doing relief work in the area. I just don’t remember how it came up but I did mention this man’s name and his work in disaster relief. As soon as he heard this, Chiang said, “Very good. What is the name of your friend?” He handed his pen and his notebook to me and said, “Write his name down.” Of course I wrote my friend’s name. It looked very insincere to me, a show of, as we say, “being modest and respectful before a scholar” [lowering oneself before the scholars]. It had the appearance of modesty and respect, of paying great attention to what I said. Sitting there and acting as though he didn’t hear the name clearly—so you “write his name down.” Actually, his secretary was sitting there in any case, he also wrote down the name. He didn’t have to have it written down for him. So, in general, this first meeting with Chiang left me with a very bad impression, and gave me the feeling that he was insincere and false.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >以后就见面机会很多，因为这个时候日本人还没有来中国、侵略中国，后来不是抗日了？抗日一起来，北方就是“卢沟桥七七事变”，南方是“八一三”，这个时候蒋被逼迫着不得不抗战了。不是有个“西安事变”？他决定放弃内战，抗日。那么“八一三”打起来了，国民政府感觉到需要广大社会支持政府，不能单单是政府抗日啊，需要广大社会的支持啊，所以就在“国防最高会议”之内成立一个“参议会”，请社会方面的人，能够代表社会的、在社会上有资望的，来做参议会的参议员，那么我就被聘当参议。</td>
		<td class="en">After this, of course, I met him many times. At the time of this first meeting, the Japanese hadn’t invaded China yet. Later, the War of Resistance began. In the North it was the Marco Polo Bridge Incident of July 7 and in the South the August 13 Incident, which forced Chiang to resist Japan. He had no choice. It was with the Xi’an Incident that he decided to abandon the civil war and resist the Japanese. The national government felt the need for the support of society as a whole. The government itself could not resist Japan all alone. So it established a Political Consultative Conference within the Supreme National Defense Conference and invited persons from non-official circles who could represent society, people of some prestige, to be members of this body. I was also appointed to this body.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个时候可以说一句话，就是我跟周恩来第一次见面就在这个地方，因为这个时候算是国共合作、一同抗日。本来是中共要求抗日嘛，不要打内战，共同抗日，可是中共方面并没有参加国民政府，怎么样子两党能够携手抗战？就是在这个参议会，在国防最高会议里头参与抗日的事情。这个时候名单上发表的有毛泽东，而毛没有来，周来，所以我跟周公第一次见面 是在这个地方见的面。</td>
		<td class="en">The first time I met Premier Zhou Enlai was at these meetings of this body. At this time, there was in principle a cooperative union between the CCP and the Nationalist Party for resistance against Japan. Actually, it was the CCP that was advocating for resistance against Japan with no more civil war at the beginning. But the Chinese Communists did not by any means participate in the national government, so how did the two parties join hands to resist Japan? It was in this consultative conference and the Supreme National Defense Conference. At this time the name list of the conference had Mao’s name on it, but Mao never attended. Zhou attended. So, the first time I met Mr. Zhou was there at those meetings.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那么参议会里头找来的还有些个什么人呢？有黄炎培，在上海一带很有名的；有刚刚放出来的沈钧儒，沈钧儒是救国会了，救国会就是主张赶紧抗日、不要打内战的，本来他都是把沈钧儒扣在苏州监狱里边，他认为你们是跟共产党跑的，可是这个时候两党合作都要抗日了，所以把沈钧儒（等）“七君子”都放出来，放出来也参加这个参议会；还有社会有名的人——胡适、天津南开大学的张伯苓，还有一个有名的军事学家叫蒋方震，还有北大学生里头很出名的傅斯年，如此之类。他还找一些通习外交的人，这个时候抗日根据国际（形势）要采取联系，所以他就把颜惠庆、还有一个施肇基都请来。国民党的老辈，久已跟南京政府很疏远了，可是国民党的老辈，像是那个马君武，广西人，都请来，这个就叫做“国防最高会议参议会”。</td>
		<td class="en">Who else participated in the meetings? Huang Yanpei, who was famous in the  Shanghai region. Shen Junru, who had just been released from detention, was also there. Shen was a member of the National Salvation Society, which advocated for an end to civil war and resistance to Japan. He had been arrested and kept in prison  in Suzhou, for Chiang had felt that “you were all going with the Communists.” But at this time, the two parties had started to cooperate, so the “Seven Gentlemen,” Shen included, were released, and they participated in the Political Consultative Conference. Hu Shi also participated, and so did Zhang Boling of Nankai University, the great military scholar Jiang Fangzhen and the famous Peking University scholar Fu Sinian, and so on. They also found people familiar with diplomacy, for linking up internationally with allies against Japanese. So, because of this, they asked Yan Huiqing and Shi Zhaoji to participate too. They also asked several Nationalist Party veterans who had long been alienated from the Nanjing government, such as Ma Junwu, a Guangxi native. All were asked to participate in the Political Consultative Conference under the Supreme National Defense Conference.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个时候是我跟蒋接触稍微多一点的时候，从这儿来的。我现在就是在这个会议上，蒋嘛因为他要指挥军事了，军事上忙得很，所以这个会是汪做主席。我们开会都是在夜间开会，为什么呢？因为日本的飞机都来轰炸了。因为汪主持这个会，蒋自己忙军事，很忙，就在我们开会的时候，蒋派一个人，派一个他的秘书吧，来在我们散会的时候看我，说蒋委员长请梁先生明天早晨几点钟，比如8点钟，到官邸见面。那么我当然答应了。这个时候我刚好从会里跟蒋方震一起出来，蒋方震当然就知道我明天要见蒋了，蒋方震就对我说，明天你去跟蒋见面的时候，你替我说，我愿意去山东，去山东看一看山东的防务、国防。我说好，所以等到我跟蒋见面的时候，我就替蒋方震说了这个话。他说很好，就请你——就请我啊，你陪着蒋百里先生（蒋方震字百里）去山东视察。</td>
		<td class="en">At this time, my contact with Chiang increased somewhat from this conference on. Chiang was busy with directing military operations, however, and so Wang Jingwei was chairman of the conference. We held all of our meetings at night, because the Japanese planes were bombing. Wang presided over meetings, as Chiang was very busy with military affairs. At the end of a meeting, Chiang dispatched a secretary of his to see me, and said that Chairman Chiang [as Chair of the Military Affairs Committee] invited me to go to his official residence the next morning at a certain time to talk, e.g., 8 o’clock. I agreed to see him, of course. The secretary approached me right as I was coming out of the meeting hall together with Jiang Fangzhen, so Jiang Fangzhen knew that I would be seeing Chiang the next morning. So he said to me, “When you see Chiang tomorrow, tell him that I want to go to Shandong to inspect matters related to defense.” I agreed. So, when I was meeting with Chiang, I told him this on behalf of Mr. Jiang Fangzhen. Chiang agreed, and asked me to go together with Jiang Baili [Jiang Fangzhen’s sobriquet] to Shandong.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >**梁**：那么很好了，我就要陪着蒋百里先生去山东了，蒋百里先生就问我，说有一个人呢，想同你见面，你可以不可以见他啊？我说是谁啊？他说是蒋介石的一个大将，叫胡宗南。我说是什么人都可以见，特别这个时候要共同抗日嘛，那么大家越能够联合、越能够团结越好嘛。他说那么样子，我明天从南京坐火车路过徐州——胡宗南正驻在徐州，我们在徐州下车，同他见面谈一谈。后来果然我们一同坐火车路过徐州的时候，胡宗南带着他的参谋长，带着旁的什么秘书长，很多人，在车站等候，接我们。我跟蒋百里就一同到他的司令部，住一夜，谈话。然后第二天，火车在同一个钟点再过来的时候，我们上车去山东。后来我跟胡宗南还有一些接触，后来在陕西西安有些接触。胡宗南他是一个在政治上有野心的人，他并不是想单做一个军人，所以他愿意同我们交朋友。</td>
		<td class="en">**Liang**: It was pretty good that I would go to Shandong with Jiang Baili. [Later] Jiang Baili told me that there was someone who wanted to meet me, and asked me if I was willing to see him. I asked him who it was. He answered that it was one of Chiang’s generals, Hu Zongnan. I answered that I was willing to meet with anyone, no matter whom, especially at this critical moment for the War of Resistance. The greater the degree of solidarity, the greater the chance of success in resisting Japan. He said, “Alright, tomorrow we will pass through Xuzhou (Hu Zongnan was stationed in Xuzhou). We’ll go together to have a talk with Hu.” The next day, we went by railroad through Xuzhou. Hu Zongnan, his chief of staff, and his secretary general were all waiting at the station for us. We went to Hu’s headquarters and talked the whole night. The next day the same train, at the same time, passed through Xuzhou and we boarded and went on to Shandong. Later in Xi’an, I had some further contact with Hu. He was a politically ambitious man. He didn’t want to be just a military man so he wanted to make friends with us.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >跟蒋的部下、蒋的很信任的人，比如陈诚，陈诚也同我有往来，那是退守武汉的时候了。退守武汉的时候，陈诚他住在武汉大学里头，武汉大学那个地名叫珞珈山，他自己住在珞珈山武汉大学里边，他请我到他家里头吃饭、谈话，他算是蒋下面很有力量的一个人。车来接我们，我当然就坐车去了。到他住的地方珞珈山武汉大学里边——学校是停了，他没回来，可是坐了有刚刚几分钟他就回来了。回来了他就谈话了，他老是谈话，老是说他的话，老是骂人、批评人，特别批评那个内政部长黄绍竑，他说那是个草包，这个样子。几乎没有空让我说话，我插不上话去，因为他老说、老说，话说得很乱，气很盛。后来伺候的人来报告，说是要开晚饭了，请进去吃饭，吃饭的时候嘛，不能多说话了，他也还不闲着，吃完饭后还是说话，我想跟他说的话，几乎没有空说。</td>
		<td class="en">I also had contact with the subordinate that Chiang Kai-shek trusted most, Chen Cheng. This was at the time of the retreat back to defend Wuhan. Chen Cheng was living at Wuhan University. Wuhan University was located in Luojiashan. Chen lived there. He asked me to his house for dinner and to talk. He was one of the most powerful of Chiang Kai-shek’s subordinates. A car was sent to pick us up. So we got in and went to his house at Luojiashan within Wuhan University campus — the university had been closed. He was not in. But after a few minutes of sitting there waiting, he came in. He talked, but talked about his own topic continually — criticizing, maligning and berating the Minister of the Interior, Huang Shaohong. He said that Huang was a big dummy. He kept talking continually and didn’t let me get a word in edgewise. He just kept on, in a very disorganized manner, very angrily. Later one of his staff came in to report that it was time for dinner. So he invited us to go in to dinner. Now, during the time he was eating, of course, he couldn’t talk much, but he was by no means quiet. After he finished eating, he continued his non-stop diatribe, giving me no chance at all to say anything.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">I took the opportunity when he was speaking relatively slowly to say something because I wanted to say something about the condition of my people. We had brought out some men and rifles from Shandong, over 800 men and more than 800 rifles. We also had tens of thousands of silver dollars in cash. As the administrative commissioner and the county magistrate, we brought out the cash and the armed militia. So I told him that we wanted to go back to Shandong. The militia wanted to fight its way back home. Finally, after much effort, I brought up thematter by cutting off his tirade. So, after this experience with him I felt that he wasn’t a man of great ability; he was too shallow and superficial. This is an example of the contact I had with people on Chiang’s side.

I couldn’t speak English, so a friend of mine, Ye Duyi, interpreted for me. I felt that General Marshall was a truly good person. He was a devoutly religious man. Chiang Kai-shek was really bothered by him. Didn’t Chiang go hide himself off at Lushan? At the time, the weather was not really all that hot. Of course, Lushan was a cool place, but he didn’t go off there to escape the heat. He wanted to hide from Marshall. This put General Marshall in a bad position. He repeatedly went to Lushan.

Was it just because he wanted to maintain his dictatorial powers that he refused to be reasonable? (Liang: Right.) Because he thought that he had more troops, had good weapons, (Liang: He had U.S. backing.) he had an air force, the CCP didn’t have an air force—no matter what, the Nationalist was much stronger than the CCP. (Liang: Many conditions were stronger.) So because of this, he then refused. (Liang: He looked down upon the CCP.) He looked down on the CCP.

So, one time Premier Zhou came to him with a proposal that was a concession on the CCP’s part, and thought that this would satisfy him. But Chiang came back and said that there was still a problem, and this problem called for a further concession from the CCP. So he kept pressing them continually. The CCP knew quite well that it did not have as much power as Chiang did, and knew that it didn’t have international recognition as the government of China as Chiang did, or have American help. So, the situation was like, as the saying in ancient Chinese goes, “troops full of righteous indignation will certainly prevail; troops full of pride will certainly be defeated.” It was the CCP’s troops that had been continually pressed and filled with righteous indignation.</td></tr>

In ancient Chinese, the best person was called a “paragon,” and I totally regarded Mr. Zhou as a paragon. There was nothing you could find fault with, no matter whether in his public or private morals. For example, he and Deng Yingchao had no children. Madame Deng seemed to have said that he could take another woman, but he didn’t want to do so. In this area of marital relations, which was a private matter, he was very clean. In his work, he helped Chairman Mao in dealing with both internal matters of China and with the international area. One could say that before and especially after the founding of the state, if Premier Zhou was not handling things internal and foreign, well, Mao alone could not have handled it and would have failed; he relied on Zhou for both. Zhou worked like blazes. Everyone knows that he sometimes did not eat; he had no time to eat, so he was given something in the car and had a few bites, and immediately took off. He would work into the night. He received many foreigners, straight into the night, and slept very little, and didn’t care much about food.

But he [Zhou] himself had very few specific opinions. He went along with Mao completely. One could say that he was Mao’s best assistant. He was number two, never the first in command. An old Chinese saying is “a sage ruler and a worthy prime minister.” He was the virtuous prime minister. When Zhou died, people from all sides, even the common people… There was no one who didn’t miss him, admire him and grieve for him. Even when Mao died, it wasn’t like this.

That was because after the Japanese came, the entire country collapsed. For example, right after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, in the South in Shanghai, on August 13, a battle started. But we didn’t have any capacities of resistance. Shanghai fell, and we pulled back to Nanjing. Nanjing fell and we pulled back to Wuhan. In the North, Beijing and Tianjin fell. All of Shandong fell.

So, I thought I’d go see if the Communist Party had any way of dealing with the situation. So, with this mind, I went to see Mao, and found that Mao was not the least bit pessimistic. He told me, “China must undergo this great disaster. But the Japanese should not be joyful too soon. I expect they will be defeated.” At the time I went to see him, he was in the midst of writing “On Protracted War,” so he told me in effect the contents of his essay. He said that the Japanese had overrated their own strength. They were dreaming vainly of swallowing up China. A vain dream, a joke. China was a big country, too big, and Japan was just too small. Moreover, it wasn’t just a Sino-Japanese question. The world powers would not stand idly by and watch Japan annex China. “An unjust cause draws meager support. A just cause draws myriad support.” Later the world powers all stood againt Japan.</td></tr>

These distinctions were not like classes in the West, which were fixed and fully formed. In China, society and social groups were loose, unorganized and fluid. Because of this mobility, society was fluid and unorganized, and so the struggles were not all that intense or sharp. It was not a situation of two opposing classes—aristocrats versus serfs, as in the Western Middle Ages, or capitalists versus workers in capitalist society. China didn’t have any such thing. Chinese like harmony and compromise. Yes, there was struggle, but it was not habitual, nor did it have any great dynamic force.</td></tr>

Finally he said, “Mr. Liang, you are overly emphasizing the peculiar, distinctive nature of Chinese society, but Chinese society is still a human society, and so still has its qualities which it shares with all human societies.” I answered, “I completely agree with you. I completely agree with you that Chinese society has qualities in common with other human societies, but I insist that its peculiar or distinctive features are more important. For example, let’s say we are speaking of a person. You say, I ‘know’ that person. Only if you can say what the special characteristicof that person is, what is distinctive about him, can you then say you ‘know’ him. If you speak about the person only from the aspect of his characteristics that he has in common with others—that he is a male, middle-aged, and so on, it won’t do. You must speak of his special features as an individual, and only then can you really know him.” So, I told Chairman Mao, “Your approach is not as good as mine.

Almost all the others vainly hoped for the establishment of British-style rule by political parties. That is, in the national assembly, there would be two large parties; when one was in power, the other would supervise the governance. If the party in power made any mistakes, or did something that was objectionable to the party out of power, the latter would then take power. So the two parties would take turns being in power. This is the situation in England, and to an extent, in the U.S.A. So the others all dreamed of establishing this kind of government. I said that this kind of government did not meet the needs of China, because economically, industrially in particular, China was so different from the Western countries. China was not an industrialized, developed country, so this kind of government would not work. China’s most urgent task was to develop economically as quickly as possible. In order to accomplish this, China needed a truly national, central politica authority to adopt a fixed, definite guiding principle, a fixed course of action. This fixing of a definite course of action would be through a national governmental power or regime, and should maintain stability for several decades. Only in this way would China be able to develop economically and catch up with the foreign countries. So, I felt and feel that this alternating of political parties in power simply would not work because the national course of action would change whenever the other political party out of power came into power. So, today one policy, tomorrow another. That just won’t work.</td></tr>

The CCP took power and did accomplish some things in these years. It’s too bad that during those decades of control, there were several periods of political and social turmoil. But now, it looks as though these periods of turmoil are over and will not recur, so that from now on China can stride forward rapidly. So, as I said, I am very optimistic about the future.

My own feeling was that China didn’t need any new political party, like America or England. So, although I founded the Democratic League, my purpose was for this organization to represent society in general, in between the two major parties, and to make the two parties compromise with each other and to further the war against Japan and the building of the nation.
