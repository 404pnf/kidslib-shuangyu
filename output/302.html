		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一位故去已久的朋友，曾在作者写作生涯的最初期提供了这部文学作品主题的灵感。之后，作者发现，大致于本世纪初发表的一部作品集收录了相同的故事。他认为该故事最有可能是柏林霍夫曼民间传说，或许在德国年鉴里出现过，但是在作品集出版的时候被删去了。对于作者而言，以《人间喜剧》的丰富原创性，承认这篇无意抄袭也并非大事。正如多有贵人扶助的拉封丹把无意中听到的老故事用自己的方式讲述出来一般。1830年的时候，作家们为了取悦年轻的妇人们而撰写自己的“恐怖故事”，而此作却不同于那些流行的糊弄人的故事。若是你了解唐璜华丽弑父的缘由，请尝试设想一下，那些在十九世纪抢夺他人钱财，并因为担心得感冒而承诺给受害人养老金以及租房给时日不多的老太太的正派人士，同样的事情就不会发生吗？他们会让那些财产的原本持有者复活吗？我想恳请有良心的行家思考一下唐璜和那些把自己子女作为攀豪门筹码的家长有多少相似之处。某些哲学家声称人性是在不断进步的，那等待他人的死亡以从中获利的艺术是否是人性进步的方向呢？关于这门艺术，我们需要许多靠死人吃饭的正派专业。有些人完全把希望寄托在某个人适时死亡之上，他们纠结于某人的死期，就如每天清晨蜷伏在尸体上，而那具尸体到了晚上便可以作为枕头。这类人有主教助理、临时工、养老金储金会会员等，诸如此类。许多慎行之人也可以纳入此类，他们渴望不择手段获得地产，一丝不苟、无情地计算着年过八十或九十的父亲或是继母的死期，并告诉自己：“三年之后财产肯定就归我了，到时候——”我们厌恶间谍甚于厌恶杀人犯。杀人犯可能是因为一时冲动，或许会忏悔、赎罪；但是间谍终究是个间谍，不论日夜、就寝用餐或行于他国，恶劣的品质总是贯穿于其人生的每个细节。那么若是你人生的每个瞬间都被谋杀所污染，生命意义何在？难道我们不是在承认我们之中的大多数人在法律、风俗以及居住习惯所影响之下时刻期盼亲人的死吗？有人脑子里一边想着棺材，一边为妻子的开司米披肩讨价还价，走上剧院台阶，想着看小丑表演，想买辆马车。他们是思想上的杀人犯，而他们的至亲像孩子一般无辜地抬起额头等待着他们的亲吻和晚安。每时每刻当他们的眼神撞上亲人的凝视，他们也会假装凝视以示亲近，他们的双眼每个清晨依旧沐着日光，就像这部作品中的贝尔维代罗一样。只有上帝知道有多少人内心有弑父的想法。试想一下这样一种思想状态：一个人必须为了年金伺候一位素不相识的老太太，他们隔着一条小溪，居于乡村，两人都恨透对方却相敬如宾。这种传统之下，兄弟之间都好似戴上了面具，兄长获得了继承权，弟弟获得了合法身份。整个欧洲文明都建立在世袭继承的基石之上，世袭便是中枢，颠覆这一基石显得很疯狂，但我们难道不能在这样一个以机械发明为骄傲的年代，完善这个被称为社会机械的最重要的部分吗？</td>
		<td class="en">At the very outset of the writer’s literary career, a friend, long since dead, gave him the subject of this Study.Later on he found the same story in a collection published about the beginning of the present century.To the best of his belief, it is some stray fancy of the brain of Hoffmann of Berlin; probably it appeared in some German almanac, and was omitted in the published editions of his collected works. @The Comedie Humaine@ is sufficiently rich in original creations for the author to own to this innocent piece of plagiarism; when, like the worthy La Fontaine, he has told unwittingly, and after his own fashion, a tale already related by another.This is not one of the hoaxes in vogue in the year 1830, when every author wrote his “tale of horror” for the amusement of young ladies.When you have read the account of Don Juan’s decorous parricide, try to picture to yourself the part which would be played under very similar circumstances by honest folk who, in this nineteenth century, will take a man’s money and undertake to pay him a life annuity on the faith of a chill, or let a house to an ancient lady for the term of her natural life!Would they be for resuscitating their clients?I should dearly like a connoisseur in consciences to consider how far there is a resemblance between a Don Juan and fathers who marry their children to great expectations.Does humanity, which, according to certain philosophers, is making progress, look on the art of waiting for dead men’s shoes as a step in the right direction?To this art we owe several honorable professions, which open up ways of living on death.There are people who rely entirely on an expected demise; who brood over it, crouching each morning upon a corpse, that serves again for their pillow at night.To this class belong bishops’ coadjutors, cardinals’ supernumeraries, tontiniers, and the like.Add to the list many delicately scrupulous persons eager to buy landed property beyond their means, who calculate with dry logic and in cold blood the probable duration of the life of a father or of a step-mother, some old man or woman of eighty or ninety, saying to themselves, “I shall be sure to come in for it in three years’ time, and then—”A murderer is less loathsome to us than a spy.The murderer may have acted on a sudden mad impulse; he may be penitent and amend; but a spy is always a spy, night and day, in bed, at table, as he walks abroad; his vileness pervades every moment of his life.Then what must it be to live when every moment of your life is tainted with murder?And have we not just admitted that a host of human creatures in our midst are led by our laws, customs, and usages to dwell without ceasing on a fellow-creature’s death?There are men who put the weight of a coffin into their deliberations as they bargain for Cashmere shawls for their wives, as they go up the staircase of a theatre, or think of going to the Bouffons, or of setting up a carriage; who are murderers in thought when dear ones, with the irresistible charm of innocence, hold up childish foreheads to be kissed with a “Good-night, father!”Hourly they meet the gaze of eyes that they would fain close for ever, eyes that still open each morning to the light, like Belvidero’s in this Study.God alone knows the number of those who are parricides in thought.Picture to yourself the state of mind of a man who must pay a life annuity to some old woman whom he scarcely knows; both live in the country with a brook between them, both sides are free to hate cordially, without offending against the social conventions that require two brothers to wear a mask if the older will succeed to the entail, and the other to the fortune of a younger son.The whole civilization of Europe turns upon the principle of hereditary succession as upon a pivot; it would be madness to subvert the principle; but could we not, in an age that prides itself upon its mechanical inventions, perfect this essential portion of the social machinery?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果作者在一个他极力展示各种文学形式的作品之前保留了“致读者”的传统写作风格，那么这是为了说出适用于此作品集的话语，尤其是这段故事。他的所有作品都基于这些或多或少能称得上“新”的观念之上，在他本人看来，这需要文学的形式来表达，他承认某些形式和某些观念在之前已经涉足文学领域，在某些情况之下已经成为了共同的财富。因此每个故事的首次出版日期并不会成为那些欣然评判他的读者们对他漠视的控诉。</td>
		<td class="en">If the author has preserved the old-fashioned style of address @To the Reader@ before a work wherein he endeavors to represent all literary forms, it is for the purpose of making a remark that applies to several of the Studies, and very specially to this.Every one of his compositions has been based upon ideas more or less novel, which, as it seemed to him, needed literary expression; he can claim priority for certain forms and for certain ideas which have since passed into the domain of literature, and have there, in some instances, become common property; so that the date of the first publication of each Study cannot be a matter of indifference to those of his readers who would fain do him justice.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">A banquet in those times was a marvelous spectacle which only royal wealth or the power of a mightly lord could furnish forth.Seated about a table lit up with perfumed tapers, seven laughter-loving women were interchanging sweet talk.The white marble of the noble works of art about them stood out against the red stucco walls, and made strong contrasts with the rich Turkey carpets.Clad in satin, glittering with gold, and covered with gems less brilliant than their eyes, each told a tale of energetic passions as diverse as their styles of beauty.They differed neither in their ideas nor in their language; but the expression of their eyes, their glances, occasional gestures, or the tones of their voices supplied a commentary, dissolute, wanton, melancholy, or satirical, to their words.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">A third, a neophyte at these banquets, was inclined to blush.“I feel remorse in the depths of my heart!I am a Catholic, and afraid of hell.But I love you, I love you so that I can sacrifice my hereafter to you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第四位妇人将希俄斯酒一饮而尽。她嚷嚷着：“我要快乐的生活！对我来说每个黎明都是新的开始。往事如过眼云烟，昨日的狂欢放纵仍历历在目，我把人生一饮而尽——一个完整的充满快乐与爱意的人生。”</td>
		<td class="en">The fourth drained a cup of Chian wine.“Give me a joyous life!” she cried; “I begin life afresh each day with the dawn.Forgetful of the past, with the intoxication of yesterday’s rapture still upon me, I drink deep of life—a whole lifetime of pleasure and of love!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >坐在贝尔维代罗旁边的妇人注视着他，目光明亮而炽热。然而她并没有说话。接着她说道——“若是我的情人抛弃了我，我才不会雇人对他下毒手呢！”最终她喊着笑着，痉挛的手把一个精美的金制容器打破了。</td>
		<td class="en">The woman who sat next to Juan Belvidero looked at him with a feverish glitter in her eyes.She was silent.Then—“I should need no hired bravo to kill my lover if he forsook me!” she cried at last, and laughed, but the marvelously wrought gold comfit box in her fingers was crushed by her convulsive clutch.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您何时才是大公呢？”第六位问道。她眼中流露出一个酗酒的女人对酒的狂热，嘴角挂着恶毒的微笑，嘴唇间露出的牙齿闪闪发光。</td>
		<td class="en">“When are you to be Grand Duke?” asked the sixth.There was the frenzy of a Bacchante in her eyes, and her teeth gleamed between the lips parted with a smile of cruel glee.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是啊，您父亲何时才会死啊？”第七位妇人边问边魅惑而顽皮地把自己的花束扔向唐璜。她天真无邪，并不信牛鬼蛇神之说。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >七位来自的费拉拉姑娘，唐璜的友人，以及受邀而来的亲王，发出惊恐的叹息。两百年后，在路易十五的年代，上流人士或许会嘲笑这俏皮话。还是说，在狂欢之初会有些许不寻常的清醒呢？除却烛火之光、感官喧嚣、金银闪烁、酒香扑鼻和美人之色，在他们被美酒冲昏头脑之前，心底或许还挣扎地闪烁着对神圣事物的敬意和人性。然而终究花儿还是谢了，眼神逐渐呆滞，用拉伯雷的话来说，就是“从头到脚被醉意占据”。</td>
		<td class="en">The seven Ferrarese, Don Juan’s friends, the Prince himself, gave a cry of horror.Two hundred years later, in the days of Louis XV., people of taste would have laughed at this witticism.Or was it, perhaps, that at the outset of an orgy there is a certain unwonted lucidity of mind?Despite the taper light, the clamor of the senses, the gleam of gold and silver, the fumes of wine, and the exquisite beauty of the women, there may perhaps have been in the depths of the revelers’ hearts some struggling glimmer of reverence for things divine and human, until it was drowned in glowing floods of wine!Yet even then the flowers had been crushed, eyes were growing dull, and drunkenness, in Rabelais’ phrase, had “taken possession of them down to their sandals.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >短暂的停顿之后门开了，就好似伯沙撒的宴会上上帝显灵了一样，不过这次的上帝似乎是个白发苍苍的老仆，蹒跚而至，愁容满面地盯着桌边的人们。他目光暗淡地瞥了一眼花冠，金杯，堆叠如金字塔般的水果，宴会上炫目的灯光，被吓得通红的面容，女子白皙的手臂压着的垫子色调。</td>
		<td class="en">During that brief pause a door opened; and as once the Divine presence was revealed at Belshazzar’s feast, so now it seemed to be manifest in the apparition of an old white-haired servant, who tottered in, and looked sadly from under knitted brows at the revelers.He gave a withering glance at the garlands, the golden cups, the pyramids of fruit, the dazzling lights of the banquet, the flushed scared faces, the hues of the cushions pressed by the white arms of the women.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“少爷，老爷不行了！”他沙哑地说着那些庄严的词汇，给狂野的笑声披上了一层黑色的面纱。</td>

		<td class="en">Does it so seldom happen that a father’s death surprises youth in the full-blown splendor of life, in the midst of the mad riot of an orgy?Death is as unexpected in his caprice as a courtesan in her disdain; but death is truer—Death has never forsaken any man.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >唐璜关上了宴会大厅的门，当他走下清冷阴暗的长走廊时，他企图使自己像个熟练的戏子。当他想到这个角色时，他暂时抛开了快乐的情绪，就好像扔掉餐巾一样。夜色漆黑。沉默的仆人带他前往垂危之人的寝室，灯光昏暗，死神在凄冷、静默、黑暗的协助下，抑或醉酒的本能反应，让这个挥金如土的年轻人有了清醒思考的机会。他检视一生，若有所思，就像一个在前往法庭路上的被告。</td>
		<td class="en">Don Juan closed the door of the banqueting-hall; and as he went down the long gallery, through the cold and darkness, he strove to assume an expression in keeping with the part he had to play; he had thrown off his mirthful mood, as he had thrown down his table napkin, at the first thought of this role.The night was dark.The mute servitor, his guide to the chamber where the dying man lay, lighted the way so dimly that Death, aided by cold, silence, and darkness, and it may be by a reaction of drunkenness, could send some sober thoughts through the spendthrift’s soul.He examined his life, and became thoughtful, like a man involved in a lawsuit on his way to the Court.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >唐璜的父亲巴托洛梅奥·贝尔维代罗是一位年过九十的老人，终其一生都执着于经商。他曾在许多次去东方的魔幻般的旅行之中获得了大量财富和知识，因此据说，就他而言，知识可比黄金钻石有价值多了，后者对他而言已经逐渐失去意义。</td>
		<td class="en">Bartolommeo Belvidero, Don Juan’s father, was an old man of ninety, who had devoted the greatest part of his life to business pursuits.He had acquired vast wealth in many a journey to magical Eastern lands, and knowledge, so it was said, more valuable than the gold and diamonds, which had almost ceased to have any value for him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“比起红宝石，我倒宁愿嘴里能多颗牙。”他有时笑着说。这位爱子心切的父亲喜欢听唐璜叙说年轻人狂野的行为。“只要你乐意，好孩子——”他总会边笑着说边把钱扔给儿子。人老了看到年轻人总是难免高兴，这位慈爱的父亲看着年轻而充满活力的生命就会忘记自己已至暮年。</td>
		<td class="en">“I would give more to have a tooth in my head than for a ruby,” he would say at times with a smile.The indulgent father loved to hear Don Juan’s story of this and that wild freak of youth.“So long as these follies amuse you, dear boy—” he would say laughingly, as he lavished money on his son.Age never took such pleasure in the sight of youth; the fond father did not remember his own decaying powers while he looked on that brilliant young life.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >巴托洛梅奥·贝尔维代罗在六十岁时曾与一位娴静美丽的天使坠入爱河。唐璜则是这段短暂迟暮之爱的全部结晶。这位鳏夫为失去挚爱的朱安娜哀悼了十五年，而对于迟暮的悲伤，他的爱子及不计其数的管家认为是因此而产生怪癖的结果。他把自己关在宫殿里最不舒适的角落，足不出户，甚至连唐璜在看望父亲之前都必须先得到允许。如果这位不羁的隐者出入于自己的宫殿或是费拉拉的街巷，他步履好似梦游，兀自陶醉，仿佛在同记忆抗争，同自己的思绪扭打着。</td>
		<td class="en">Bartolommeo Belvidero, at the age of sixty, had fallen in love with an angel of peace and beauty.Don Juan had been the sole fruit of this late and short-lived love.For fifteen years the widower had mourned the loss of his beloved Juana; and to this sorrow of age, his son and his numerous household had attributed the strange habits that he had contracted.He had shut himself up in the least comfortable wing of his palace, and very seldom left his apartments; even Don Juan himself must first ask permission before seeing his father.If this hermit, unbound by vows, came or went in his palace or in the streets of Ferrara, he walked as if he were in a dream, wholly engrossed, like a man at strife with a memory, or a wrestler with some thought.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >年轻的唐璜在举行盛大的宴会，宫殿里喧嚣欢笑绕梁，马儿受惊扰似的踏着后院的土地，侍者在台阶上掷起了骰子，争吵不休，但巴托洛梅奥每天只是就着水吃七盎司的面包。他偶尔会吃点儿禽类，只是为了他那条忠实的黑毛犬朋友能吃着骨头。他从不抱怨吵闹。若是猎户的号角和狗吠不适时地惊扰了他的睡梦，他只会说：“啊！唐璜回家了。”从来没有一位父亲能如此不计较、如此宠爱他的孩子；所以其子在与其交谈时已习惯了吊儿郎当，也养成了一个被宠坏了的孩子所有的毛病。他对待父亲就像娇纵的交际花对待一位年长的追求者；即便再任性放肆，对方也只会百依百顺的用笑容和幽默讨自己欢心。</td>
		<td class="en">The young Don Juan might give princely banquets, the palace might echo with clamorous mirth, horses pawed the ground in the courtyards, pages quarreled and flung dice upon the stairs, but Bartolommeo ate his seven ounces of bread daily and drank water.A fowl was occasionally dressed for him, simply that the black poodle, his faithful companion, might have the bones.Bartolommeo never complained of the noise.If the huntsmen’s horns and baying dogs disturbed his sleep during his illness, he only said, “Ah! Don Juan has come back again.”Never on earth has there been a father so little exacting and so indulgent; and, in consequence, young Belvidero, accustomed to treat his father unceremoniously, had all the faults of a spoiled child.He treated old Bartolommeo as a wilful courtesan treats an elderly adorer; buying indemnity for insolence with a smile, selling good-humor, submitting to be loved.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >唐璜不住想起年少的情景，发现要从父亲的溺爱之中挑出毛病可真是太难了。他内心深处感到了一丝前所未有的悔意，几乎要原谅这位行将就木的父亲如此长命了。他好似记起了孝道，正如贼在熟练偷得百万财产之后又想回归正派。</td>
		<td class="en">Don Juan, beholding scene after scene of his younger years, saw that it would be a difficult task to find his father’s indulgence at fault.Some new-born remorse stirred the depths of his heart; he felt almost ready to forgive this father now about to die for having lived so long.He had an accession of filial piety, like a thief’s return in thought to honesty at the prospect of a million adroitly stolen.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >走了不久，唐璜穿过又高又冷的父亲居住的房间，潮湿浑浊的空气侵入他的皮肤，老旧的毯子散发的霉味充斥着他的嗅觉，沾满灰尘的压具映入他的眼帘，而现在他站在老人古朴的房间，在死气沉沉的炉火旁边放着那张令人不悦的死者之床。哥特式桌子上闪烁的灯光忽明忽暗，摇摆不定，光线掠过床前，老人脸上的表情也显得变幻莫测。寒风呼啸，吹过歪斜的窗沿的缝隙，雪花抽打着窗户发出窒息的声音。眼前凄厉的场景和声音与唐璜之前宴会的场面大相径庭，令他忍不住打冷颤。当他走向床边，阵风骤然吹亮了灯火，父亲的脸在突如其来的亮光之下显得糜烂而扭曲，周围映着骨头的轮廓形容枯槁，在白色枕头的映衬下分外恐怖，他不禁感到寒冷。唇边的肌肉痛苦地抽动着，没了牙齿，那闭不紧的可怖的双唇呻吟着，与屋外哀嚎的风呼应着。</td>
		<td class="en">Before long Don Juan had crossed the lofty, chilly suite of rooms in which his father lived; the penetrating influences of the damp close air, the mustiness diffused by old tapestries and presses thickly covered with dust had passed into him, and now he stood in the old man’s antiquated room, in the repulsive presence of the deathbed, beside a dying fire.A flickering lamp on a Gothic table sent broad uncertain shafts of light, fainter or brighter, across the bed, so that the dying man’s face seemed to wear a different look at every moment.The bitter wind whistled through the crannies of the ill-fitting casements; there was a smothered sound of snow lashing the windows.The harsh contrast of these sights and sounds with the scenes which Don Juan had just quitted was so sudden that he could not help shuddering.He turned cold as he came towards the bed; the lamp flared in a sudden vehement gust of wind and lighted up his father’s face; the features were wasted and distorted; the skin that cleaved to their bony outlines had taken wan livid hues, all the more ghastly by force of contrast with the white pillows on which he lay.The muscles about the toothless mouth had contracted with pain and drawn apart the lips; the moans that issued between them with appalling energy found an accompaniment in the howling of the storm without.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >除却死亡来临之前的表情，脸部最突出的特点就是出奇的有力。与死神较量的并非普通的精神力量。眼睛一动不动地睁着，眼眶像是患了病似的空洞。似乎巴托洛梅奥在尝试用临死前专注的眼神杀死床脚边的敌人。由于枕头上的脑袋像医院里的颅骨标本一样一动不动，那种停滞又无情的眼神显得更为可怕。被单下的身躯更加死板而僵硬，他像死人那样躺着，把残喘之力留给了那对眼睛。口中的呻吟兀自成声。唐璜对带着交际花赠与的花束，宴会的芬芳与酒香来到父亲的床边感到些许的羞愧。</td>
		<td class="en">In spite of every sign of coming dissolution, the most striking thing about the dying face was its incredible power.It was no ordinary spirit that wrestled there with Death.The eyes glared with strange fixity of gaze from the cavernous sockets hollowed by disease.It seemed as if Bartolommeo sought to kill some enemy sitting at the foot of his bed by the intent gaze of dying eyes.That steady remorseless look was the more appalling because the head that lay upon the pillow was passive and motionless as a skull upon a doctor’s table.The outlines of the body, revealed by the coverlet, were no less rigid and stiff; he lay there as one dead, save for those eyes.There was something automatic about the moaning sounds that came from the mouth.Don Juan felt something like shame that he must be brought thus to his father’s bedside, wearing a courtesan’s bouquet, redolent of the fragrance of the banqueting-chamber and the fumes of wine.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Even as he spoke the pure high notes of a woman’s voice, sustained by the sound of the viol on which she accompanied her song, rose above the rattle of the storm against the casements, and floated up to the chamber of death.Don Juan stopped his ears against the barbarous answer to his father’s speech.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Late comers who remained without saw afar, through the three great open doorways, a scene of which the theatrical illusions of modern opera can give but a faint idea.The vast church was lighted up by thousands of candles, offered by saints and sinners alike eager to win the favor of this new candidate for canonization, and these self-commending illuminations turned the great building into an enchanted fairyland.The black archways, the shafts and capitals, the recessed chapels with gold and silver gleaming in their depths, the galleries, the Arab traceries, all the most delicate outlines of that delicate sculpture, burned in the excess of light like the fantastic figures in the red heart of a brazier.At the further end of the church, above that blazing sea, rose the high altar like a splendid dawn.All the glories of the golden lamps and silver candlesticks, of banners and tassels, of the shrines of the saints and votive offerings, paled before the gorgeous brightness of the reliquary in which Don Juan lay.The blasphemer’s body sparkled with gems, and flowers, and crystal, with diamonds and gold, and plumes white as the wings of seraphim; they had set it up on the altar, where the pictures of Christ had stood.All about him blazed a host of tall candles; the air quivered in the radiant light.The worthy Abbot of San-Lucar, in pontifical robes, with his mitre set with precious stones, his rochet and golden crosier, sat enthroned in imperial state among his clergy in the choir.Rows of impassive aged faces, silver-haired old men clad in fine linen albs, were grouped about him, as the saints who confessed Christ on earth are set by painters, each in his place, about the throne of God in heaven.The precentor and the dignitaries of the chapter, adorned with the gorgeous insignia of ecclesiastical vanity, came and went through the clouds of incense, like stars upon their courses in the firmament.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >重要的时刻到来了，钟声在远处荒原中回响，庞大的人群唱起了圣歌，对上帝进行最初的膜拜。崇高的歌声！高昂而纯粹的音调、疯狂的妇人们的声音、夹杂着男士严肃、低沉的嗓音，千万人声盖过了大风琴的低沉共鸣。唱诗班男童的尖细嗓音和绕梁不绝的浑厚的男低音唤醒了美好的联想，比如童年及壮年，在令人喜悦的和声之中升起，充满着爱意。</td>
		<td class="en">When the hour of triumph arrived, the bells awoke the echoes far and wide, and the whole vast crowd raised to God the first cry of praise that begins the Te Deum.A sublime cry!High, pure notes, the voices of women in ecstasy, mingled in it with the sterner and deeper voices of men; thousands of voices sent up a volume of sound so mighty, that the straining, groaning organ-pipes could not dominate that harmony.But the shrill sound of children’s singing among the choristers, the reverberation of deep bass notes, awakened gracious associations, visions of childhood, and of man in his strength, and rose above that entrancing harmony of human voices blended in one sentiment of love.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The chant went up from the black masses of men and women kneeling in the cathedral, like a sudden breaking out of light in darkness, and the silence was shattered as by a peal of thunder.The voices floated up with the clouds of incense that had begun to cast thin bluish veils over the fanciful marvels of the architecture, and the aisles were filled with splendor and perfume and light and melody.Even at the moment when that music of love and thanksgiving soared up to the altar, Don Juan, too well bred not to express his acknowledgments, too witty not to understand how to take a jest, bridled up in his reliquary, and responded with an appalling burst of laughter.Then the Devil having put him in mind of the risk he was running of being taken for an ordinary man, a saint, a Boniface, a Pantaleone, he interrupted the melody of love by a yell, the thousand voices of hell joined in it.Earth blessed, Heaven banned.The church was shaken to its ancient foundations.</td></tr>
