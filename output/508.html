		<td class="en">Within was seen the forge, now blazing up and illuminating the high and dusky roof, and now confining its lustre to a narrow precinct of the coal-strewn floor, according as the breath of the bellows was puffed forth or again inhaled into its vast leathern lungs.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Moving about in this red glare and alternate dusk was the figure of the blacksmith, well worthy to be viewed in so picturesque an aspect of light and shade, where the bright blaze struggled with the black night, as if each would have snatched his comely strength from the other.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不一会儿，他从煤炭中抽出一根白热的铁条，放在铁砧上，挥起他力大无比的胳膊，用铁锤一下下敲打起来，黑暗中，顷刻间火花四溅，铁匠整个人裹在其中。</td>
		<td class="en">Anon he drew a white-hot bar of iron from the coals, laid it on the anvil, uplifted his arm of might, and was soon enveloped in the myriads of sparks which the strokes of his hammer scattered into the surrounding gloom.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">A watchmaker gets his brain puzzled by his wheels within a wheel, or loses his health or the nicety of his eyesight, as was my case, and finds himself at middle age, or a little after, past labor at his own trade and fit for nothing else, yet too poor to live at his ease.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“And what says Miss Annie to that doctrine?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她呀，我猜，肯定认为比起打马蹄铁或做烤肉架，修修小姐们的手表这类活儿要体面多了。”</td>
		<td class="en">She, I suppose, will think it a genteeler business to tinker up a lady’s watch than to forge a horseshoe or make a gridiron.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >安妮没等她父亲回话，赶紧拽着他向前走。</td>
		<td class="en">Annie drew her father onward without giving him time for reply.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过我们还得回到欧文·沃兰德的店铺，好好琢磨一番他的经历和性格，尽管彼得·霍文顿，或其女儿安妮，又或者欧文的老同学罗伯特·丹福思可能都觉得这些不值一提。</td>
		<td class="en">But we must return to Owen Warland’s shop, and spend more meditation upon his history and character than either Peter Hovenden, or probably his daughter Annie, or Owen’s old school-fellow, Robert Danforth, would have thought due to so slight a subject.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从他那小小的手指能握住一把小折刀时起，欧文就已表现出一种非凡的精巧灵动。有时他会用木头做出一些漂亮的玩意，主要是一些花儿鸟儿，有时又似乎致力于对机械奥秘的探究。</td>
		<td class="en">From the time that his little fingers could grasp a penknife, Owen had been remarkable for a delicate ingenuity, which sometimes produced pretty shapes in wood, principally figures of flowers and birds, and sometimes seemed to aim at the hidden mysteries of mechanism.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过，他做这些都是基于美观的目的，而从来都没有做出任何实用的东西。</td>
		<td class="en">But it was always for purposes of grace, and never with any mockery of the useful.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他并不像学校里的那些小能手们，在谷仓的屋角上装些小风车或是在附近的小溪上架些水磨。</td>
		<td class="en">He did not, like the crowd of school-boy artisans, construct little windmills on the angle of a barn or watermills across the neighboring brook.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那些发现这个小男孩的这种怪癖的人们，认为值得仔细观察他一番，有时还真能看出点儿缘由来，他好像在尝试着去模仿大自然中的美丽动作，譬如鸟儿的飞翔或小动物的活动。</td>
		<td class="en">Those who discovered such peculiarity in the boy as to think it worth their while to observe him closely, sometimes saw reason to suppose that he was attempting to imitate the beautiful movements of Nature as exemplified in the flight of birds or the activity of little animals.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >事实上，这似乎是爱美之心的一种新的发展，这发展可能会使他成为一位诗人、画家或雕塑家；而且，它至善至美，毫无功利主义的半点儿粗俗，存在于所有精美艺术之中。</td>
		<td class="en">It seemed, in fact, a new development of the love of the beautiful, such as might have made him a poet, a painter, or a sculptor, and which was as completely refined from all utilitarian coarseness as it could have been in either of the fine arts.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他看起来特别厌恶普通机械的这种刻板僵化的运动过程。</td>
		<td class="en">He looked with singular distaste at the stiff and regular processes of ordinary machinery.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >曾经有人带他去看过一次蒸汽机，本以为会满足他对机械原理的直觉性理解力，结果却看到他脸色发白、恶心不适，好像眼前是什么丑陋且不自然的东西一般。</td>
		<td class="en">Being once carried to see a steam-engine, in the expectation that his intuitive comprehension of mechanical principles would be gratified, he turned pale and grew sick, as if something monstrous and unnatural had been presented to him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这种恐惧的部分原因是由于这个铁家伙庞大的体积和惊人的能量吓到了他，因为欧文心思细腻，自然而然地专注于一些纤小细微的东西，这与他矮小的体型和纤细灵活的手指完全一致。</td>
		<td class="en">This horror was partly owing to the size and terrible energy of the iron laborer; for the character of Owen’s mind was microscopic, and tended naturally to the minute, in accordance with his diminutive frame and the marvellous smallness and delicate power of his fingers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他对美的感受倒不是因此而降低为对美丽小巧东西的偏爱。</td>
		<td class="en">Not that his sense of beauty was thereby diminished into a sense of prettiness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >美的概念与事物的大小无关，无论是小到只能进行微观细查的极小空间还是大到唯有彩虹的弧形才能丈量的广阔草地，美都能完美显现。</td>
		<td class="en">The beautiful idea has no relation to size, and may be as perfectly developed in a space too minute for any but microscopic investigation as within the ample verge that is measured by the arc of the rainbow.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但无论如何，他关注的目标和造诣一贯都是这么细致入微，这使得本可能赏识欧文·沃兰德天才的人们反而更加不会鉴别了。</td>
		<td class="en">But, at all events, this characteristic minuteness in his objects and accomplishments made the world even more incapable than it might otherwise have been of appreciating Owen Warland’s genius.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >男孩的家人们无计可施——也许是万般无奈——只好逼着他去做了钟表匠的学徒，巴望着他这种奇怪的天分能因此得到调教从而用在比较实用的正事上。</td>
		<td class="en">The boy’s relatives saw nothing better to be done—as perhaps there was not—than to bind him apprentice to a watchmaker, hoping that his strange ingenuity might thus be regulated and put to utilitarian purposes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >彼得·霍文顿对于他的这位徒弟的看法前面已经提到过。</td>
		<td class="en">Peter Hovenden’s opinion of his apprentice has already been expressed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他对这小伙子已无能为力了。</td>
		<td class="en">He could make nothing of the lad.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >的确，欧文对这行当的诀窍接受起来快得令人难以置信，但是他完全忘记了或者根本就蔑视钟表这一行当的重要目的，对计时漠不关心，就好像时间已成为永恒。</td>
		<td class="en">Owen’s apprehension of the professional mysteries, it is true, was inconceivably quick; but he altogether forgot or despised the grand object of a watchmaker’s business, and cared no more for the measurement of time than if it had been merged into eternity.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，只要他处在师傅的管教之下，欧文也不是那种强硬的人，这就使得他这种富有创造力的古怪脾性在师傅的严格命令和严密监视下并没有出格；可是当他学徒期满，接手了因彼得·霍文顿视力衰弱而不得不放弃的小店时，人们发现由欧文·沃兰德引领又老又瞎的时光老人沿着日常轨迹前行是多么不合适。</td>
		<td class="en">So long, however, as he remained under his old master’s care, Owen’s lack of sturdiness made it possible, by strict injunctions and sharp oversight, to restrain his creative eccentricity within bounds; but when his apprenticeship was served out, and he had taken the little shop which Peter Hovenden’s failing eyesight compelled him to relinquish, then did people recognize how unfit a person was Owen Warland to lead old blind Father Time along his daily course.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他所做的最明智的研究之一，就是在他那些钟表上都加了一个音乐装置，于是生活中所有不和谐的噪音都变成了美妙的旋律，每一瞬间也犹如金光璀璨的露珠，和谐悦耳地落入往昔的深渊。</td>
		<td class="en">One of his most rational projects was to connect a musical operation with the machinery of his watches, so that all the harsh dissonances of life might be rendered tuneful, and each flitting moment fall into the abyss of the past in golden drops of harmony.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >若是哪家把座钟搬来让他修理——就是那种古老高大的座钟，因为记录了许多代人的生命时光而似乎通了人性——他就会自作主张地在那古老庄重的钟面装上一队跳舞或送葬的小人，以此代表十二个快乐或忧伤的时刻。</td>
		<td class="en">If a family clock was intrusted to him for repair,—one of those tall, ancient clocks that have grown nearly allied to human nature by measuring out the lifetime of many generations,—he would take upon himself to arrange a dance or funeral procession of figures across its venerable face, representing twelve mirthful or melancholy hours.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这种怪异之举不出几次就彻底毁了这位年轻钟表匠的名声，因为镇上那些循规蹈矩、讲求实效的人们认为，对待时光可是怠慢不得的，无论它是作为现世荣华富贵的手段还是作为来生的准备。</td>
		<td class="en">Several freaks of this kind quite destroyed the young watchmaker’s credit with that steady and matter-of-fact class of people who hold the opinion that time is not to be trifled with, whether considered as the medium of advancement and prosperity in this world or preparation for the next.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不久，小店的顾客越来越少——真是不幸，可欧文·沃兰德却把这事当作意外的好运，因为近来他越来越沉迷于一件神秘的工作，此事吸引了他全部的专业知识和灵巧技艺，同时也充分展现了他那独特的天赋。</td>
		<td class="en">His custom rapidly diminished—a misfortune, however, that was probably reckoned among his better accidents by Owen Warland, who was becoming more and more absorbed in a secret occupation which drew all his science and manual dexterity into itself, and likewise gave full employment to the characteristic tendencies of his genius.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这项爱好已使他耗费了数月时光。</td>

		<td class="en">After the old watchmaker and his pretty daughter had gazed at him out of the obscurity of the street, Owen Warland was seized with a fluttering of the nerves, which made his hand tremble too violently to proceed with such delicate labor as he was now engaged upon.</td></tr>
