		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >要学会如何销售，能够销售，并去销售。人们通常不会想到巴黎的繁华在多大程度上取决于这个问题的这三方面。商店光耀夺目的陈列就像1789年之前的贵族沙龙一样豪华；咖啡馆的华丽使得而且非常容易使得如今的凡尔赛宫黯然失色；橱窗的摆设美轮美奂，每个早上都是新的，但是晚上就被拆除；年轻男子与漂亮的顾客交流时流露出高贵和典雅；年轻姑娘那迷人的脸庞和着装一定能吸引来男顾客；（尤其是最近）老板把各种商品聚集起来形成垄断的商店，商店规模宏大、占地面积广，门廊有着巴比伦式的奢华——这些都不算什么。至今，做这一切只为了满足一个感官，一个从罗马帝国时代就已经发展起来的、人类最挑剔也最疲倦的器官，直到当代，由于世界上最讲究的文明的功劳，这器官的要求变得越来越无止境了。这个器官就是“巴黎之眼”。</td>
		<td class="en">To know how to sell, to be able to sell, and to sell.People generally do not suspect how much of the stateliness of Paris is due to these three aspects of the same problem.The brilliant display of shops as rich as the salons of the noblesse before 1789; the splendors of cafes which eclipse, and easily eclipse, the Versailles of our day; the shop-window illusions, new every morning, nightly destroyed; the grace and elegance of the young men that come in contact with fair customers; the piquant faces and costumes of young damsels, who cannot fail to attract the masculine customer; and (and this especially of late) the length, the vast spaces, the Babylonish luxury of galleries where shopkeepers acquire a monopoly of the trade in various articles by bringing them all together,—all this is as nothing.Everything, so far, has been done to appeal to a single sense, and that the most exacting and jaded human faculty, a faculty developed ever since the days of the Roman Empire, until, in our own times, thanks to the efforts of the most fastidious civilization the world has yet seen, its demands are grown limitless.That faculty resides in the “eyes of Paris.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那些眼睛需要看价值十万法郎的灯饰，还有几英里长、六十英尺高的镶着彩色玻璃的豪华建筑；每晚，它们一定会在大约十四个剧场中享受一场梦幻剧，看一系列艺术极品的展出；为了满足这些眼睛，整个世界的灾难和痛苦以及整个宇宙的欢乐都要在林阴大道上或在巴黎街道上消散；为了满足这些眼睛，每年都会新出许多狂欢节的俗艳服饰和二十几本插图书本，更不用说数以百计的漫画，和数以千计的小插画、平版画和版画了。为了取悦巴黎人的眼睛，每晚要燃烧价值一万五千法郎的燃气；在此总结一下，为了它们享乐，这个伟大的城市每年要花费几百万法郎来开拓景点和种植树木。然而这还不算什么——这仅是这个问题的物质方面；事实上，与大约六万店员和四万柜台少女运用的才智相比，这算不上什么。他们运用招法的能力可以与莫里哀笔下的人物相比，他们紧盯着顾客的钱包，就像塞纳河上成群的小鲱鱼盯着吃河上意外漂过的面包屑一样。</td>
		<td class="en">Those eyes require illuminations costing a hundred thousand francs, and many-colored glass palaces a couple of miles long and sixty feet high; they must have a fairyland at some fourteen theatres every night, and a succession of panoramas and exhibitions of the triumphs of art; for them a whole world of suffering and pain, and a universe of joy, must resolve through the boulevards or stray through the streets of Paris; for them encyclopaedias of carnival frippery and a score of illustrated books are brought out every year, to say nothing of caricatures by the hundred, and vignettes, lithographs, and prints by the thousand.To please those eyes, fifteen thousand francs’ worth of gas must blaze every night; and, to conclude, for their delectation the great city yearly spends several millions of francs in opening up views and planting trees.And even yet this is as nothing—it is only the material side of the question; in truth, a mere trifle compared with the expenditure of brain power on the shifts, worthy of Moliere, invented by some sixty thousand assistants and forty thousand damsels of the counter, who fasten upon the customer’s purse, much as myriads of Seine whitebait fall upon a chance crust floating down the river.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >商场的戈迪萨尔至少和他卓越的同姓人一样，而这些同姓人现在已经成了典型的旅行推销员。如果离开他的商店和业务，他就像一只瘪了的气球；只有在那成堆的货物中他的各种才能才会发挥出来，就像一个演员只有在舞台上才令人赞叹。法国店员要比欧洲其他国家的同行人受教育程度高；必要时他能就沥青、玛比尔舞厅、波尔卡舞、文学、插图本、铁路、政治、议会以及革命问题高谈阔论；如果让他离开，离开他的商店、他的尺子和他伪装的优雅，他会笨得让人不敢相信；但如果是在自己的舞台上，站在如紧绷的钢丝绳一样的柜台前，他会花言巧语地展示披肩，眼睛盯着顾客，让伟大的塔列朗都黯然失色；他可以和蒙罗斯和莫里哀相媲美。塔列朗在自己的剧院比戈迪萨尔聪明，但在商店里情况就相反了。</td>
		<td class="en">Gaudissart in the mart is at least the equal of his illustrious namesake, now become the typical commercial traveler.Take him away from his shop and his line of business, he is like a collapsed balloon; only among his bales of merchandise do his faculties return, much as an actor is sublime only upon the boards.A French shopman is better educated than his fellows in other European countries; he can at need talk asphalt, Bal Mabille, polkas, literature, illustrated books, railways, politics, parliament, and revolution; transplant him, take away his stage, his yardstick, his artificial graces; he is foolish beyond belief; but on his own boards, on the tight-rope of the counter, as he displays a shawl with a speech at his tongue’s end, and his eye on his customer, he puts the great Talleyrand into the shade; he is a match for a Monrose and a Moliere to boot.Talleyrand in his own house would have outwitted Gaudissart, but in the shop the parts would have been reversed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一件事情就可以解释这个悖论。</td>
		<td class="en">An incident will illustrate the paradox.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两位迷人的公爵夫人正在和上文提到的这位了不起的外交家聊天。女士们想要一只手镯；此时她们正在等待从巴黎有名的珠宝商那里来的店员。一位戈迪萨尔适时带来了三只工艺精湛的手镯。女士们拿不定主意了。选择就是脑海中的灵光一闪；犹豫的话——没什么可说的了，你们一定会选错。在鉴赏力方面的灵感不会出现两次。最后，十分钟过去了，王子被请了进来。他看到两位夫人在手镯上千个刻面上反复斟酌，在两件首饰突出的优点上难以取舍，而第三件首饰已经很快就被放在一旁了。王子没有放下书本，也没有去看手镯，而是端详着珠宝店员。</td>
		<td class="en">Two charming duchesses were chatting with the above-mentioned great diplomatist.The ladies wished for a bracelet; they were waiting for the arrival of a man from a great Parisian jeweler.A Gaudissart accordingly appeared with three bracelets of marvelous workmanship.The great ladies hesitated.Choice is a mental lightning flash; hesitate—there is no more to be said, you are at fault.Inspiration in matters of taste will not come twice.At last, after about ten minutes the Prince was called in.He saw the two duchesses confronting doubt with its thousand facets, unable to decide between the transcendent merits of two of the trinkets, for the third had been set aside at once.Without leaving his book, without a glance at the bracelets, the Prince looked at the jeweler’s assistant.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你会为你的爱人选择哪个呢？”他问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Which would you choose for your sweetheart?” asked he.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >年轻店员指了指其中的一件。</td>
		<td class="en">The young man indicated one of the pair.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那样的话，选另一件吧，您会让两位夫人都高兴，”头脑敏捷的现代外交家回答道，“年轻人，以我的名义，也会让您的爱人高兴。”</td>
		<td class="en">“In that case, take the other, you will make two women happy,” said the subtlest of modern diplomatists, “and make your sweetheart happy too, in my name.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两位漂亮的女士笑了，而年轻店员带着王子的礼物高兴地离开了，同时为自己的品味得到赞赏而高兴。</td>
		<td class="en">The two fair ladies smiled, and the young shopman took his departure, delighted with the Prince’s present and the implied compliment to his taste.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一位女士从她华丽的马车上下来，停在维维恩街上一家卖披肩的高档商店前。她不是自己来的；女士们出行总是成双结对的；她们总是逛完十个商店才能拿定主意，在从一个商店走到另一个商店的间歇中嘲笑那些店员为了利润而闹出的小喜剧。让我们来看一下谁扮演得最到位——是有教养的买主还是卖主？在这场小型杂耍中谁表演得更好呢？</td>
		<td class="en">A woman alights from her splendid carriage before one of the expensive shops where shawls are sold in the Rue Vivienne.She is not alone; women almost always go in pairs on these expeditions; always make the round of half a score of shops before they make up their minds, and laugh together in the intervals over the little comedies played for their benefit.Let us see which of the two acts most in character—the fair customer or the seller, and which has the best of it in such miniature vaudevilles?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果您想要描述销售，这个巴黎商业活动的核心内容，如果您想要指出这件事情的要旨，您就得义不容辞地给出一个典型。为此，顾客在购买一件价值三千法郎的披肩或腰带时会比买一块价值三百法郎的细麻布或衣服要挑剔得多。但是，啊，要知道，如果是来自新旧大陆的外国游客（如果您已经仔细阅读了这个有关发票生理学的研究报告），那么在男子服饰用品商店里无论是买两法郎一码的巴勒吉纱罗还是四法郎一码的平纹细布，都会上演同样的喜剧。</td>
		<td class="en">If you attempt to describe a sale, the central fact of Parisian trade, you are in duty bound, if you attempt to give the gist of the matter, to produce a type, and for this purpose a shawl or a chatelaine costing some three thousand francs is a more exacting purchase than a length of lawn or dress that costs three hundred.But know, oh foreign visitors from the Old World and the New (if ever this study of the physiology of the Invoice should be by you perused), that this selfsame comedy is played in haberdashers’ shops over a barege at two francs or a printed muslin at four francs the yard.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不管您是公主还是平民太太，无论是什么身份，您怎能不相信那有着坦白无邪的眼神、长着如覆盖着绒毛的鲜桃一般脸蛋的帅气少年呢？他的穿着体面得几乎和您的——举个例子说，表亲一样。他的音调和摊在您面前的毛料一样轻柔。像他这样的还有三四位。有一位长着一双深色的眼睛，表情坚定，说话时口气专横：“这就是您想要的。”另一位年轻人长着蓝色的眼睛，举止腼腆，语言柔和，让人想说：“可怜的孩子！他就不是做生意的料。”第三位留着浅褐色头发，长着笑眯眯的褐色的眼睛，有着南方人的生动的幽默、活力和快乐；第四位长着红褐色头发，留着扇形胡子；他煞有介事地打着领结，神色严肃庄重，说话简短，就像共产主义者一样粗鲁。</td>
		<td class="en">And you, princess, or simple citizen’s wife, whichever you may be, how should you distrust that good-looking, very young man, with those frank, innocent eyes, and a cheek like a peach covered with down?He is dressed almost as well as your—cousin, let us say.His tones are soft as the woolen stuffs which he spreads before you.There are three or four more of his like.One has dark eyes, a decided expression, and an imperial manner of saying, “This is what you wish”; another, that blue-eyed youth, diffident of manner and meek of speech, prompts the remark, “Poor boy! he was not born for business”; a third, with light auburn hair, and laughing tawny eyes, has all the lively humor, and activity, and gaiety of the South; while the fourth, he of the tawny red hair and fan-shaped beard, is rough as a communist, with his portentous cravat, his sternness, his dignity, and curt speech.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这些不同类型的店员针对的是几类主要的女性顾客，可以说是店主（头）的臂膀。店主面容成熟，身材矮胖，前额半秃，胸部的尺寸足以去做一个执政内阁支持者的代表。有时店主会佩戴荣誉军团的勋带，那是为奖励他维护法国布商权杖的威严而颁发的。从他体形优美的曲线您可以看出他有妻子和家庭，有乡间别墅，还有法国银行的存折。每当店员有棘手的问题需要立刻解决的时候，店主便会出其不意地出场解围。女顾客的四周被雅致、青春、礼貌、微笑和玩笑所包围；最看似简单的文明的产物都在这里了，它们全都经过精心分类以便应付各种需求。</td>
		<td class="en">These varieties of shopmen, corresponding to the principal types of feminine customers, are arms, as it were, directed by the head, a stout personage with a full-blown countenance, a partially bald forehead, and a chest measure befitting a Ministerialist deputy.Occasionally this person wears the ribbon of the Legion of Honor in recognition of the manner in which he supports the dignity of the French drapers’ wand.From the comfortable curves of his figure you can see that he has a wife and family, a country house, and an account with the Bank of France.He descends like a deux ex machina, whenever a tangled problem demands a swift solution.The feminine purchasers are surrounded on all sides with urbanity, youth, pleasant manners, smiles, and jests; the most seeming-simple human products of civilization are here, all sorted in shades to suit all tastes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >仅仅是关于建筑、视觉以及房屋装修的自然效果的一个词；一个简短的、果断的、极端的词语，是当场即兴而发的，却能带来很大改变。包含这句有指导意义的话的教科书的一页在黎塞留大街76号店出售。在一家精美的商店上方，有一个夹层楼面，里面挂满了白色、金色和深红色天鹅绒，灯光甚至是日光从梅纳尔大街直直地照射进来，纯净而明亮，就像照进画家的工作室一样。街上哪位无所事事的人没有见过这位波斯人？这位亚洲君王曾激怒这座城市，他在证券交易所街和黎塞留街的交界处的门的正上方向全城宣布：“统治这里比统治拉奥更从容。”要不是因为这不朽的分析研究，五百年后的考古学家也许会开始绞尽脑汁研究他，并着手撰写带插图的四开本的书了（就像卡特勒梅尔先生描写奥林匹斯山的朱庇特主神的著作一样），来证明拿破仑在成为“法国皇帝”之前在东方就像国王一样了。之后，豪华的商店就设在这间狭小寒酸的夹层里；经过一番钱币的轰炸，终于入驻并成为所有者了。人间喜剧被开士米喜剧取代了。波斯人用王冠上的一两颗钻石买了如此必要的阳光；因为阳光可以衬托出颜色的作用，充分展现一件披肩的魅力，使其价格翻倍；这是无法抗拒的光；的确，它是金色的光。从这个事实中您就可以做出判断，为了达到一定效果，商店之间会相隔多远。</td>
		<td class="en">Just one word as to the natural effects of architecture, optical science, and house decoration; one short, decisive, terrible word, of history made on the spot.The work which contains this instructive page is sold at number 76 Rue de Richelieu, where above an elegant shop, all white and gold and crimson velvet, there is an entresol into which the light pours straight from the Rue de Menars, as into a painter’s studio—clean, clear, even daylight.What idler in the streets has not beheld the Persian, that Asiatic potentate, ruffling it above the door at the corner of the Rue de la Bourse and the Rue de Richelieu, with a message to deliver urbi et orbi, “Here I reign more tranquilly than at Lahore”?Perhaps but for this immortal analytical study, archaeologists might begin to puzzle their heads about him five hundred years hence, and set about writing quartos with plates (like M. Quatremere’s work on Olympian Jove) to prove that Napoleon was something of a Sofi in the East before he became “Emperor of the French.”Well, the wealthy shop laid siege to the poor little entresol; and after a bombardment with banknotes, entered and took possession.The Human Comedy gave way before the comedy of cashmeres.The Persian sacrificed a diamond or two from his crown to buy that so necessary daylight; for a ray of sunlight shows the play of the colors, brings out the charms of a shawl, and doubles its value; ’tis an irresistible light; literally, a golden ray.From this fact you may judge how far Paris shops are arranged with a view to effect.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >再回到年轻的店员身上，回到那位被法国国王设宴接待的佩戴勋带的四十岁男子身上，回到专横的红胡子领班身上。这些老练的戈迪萨尔们每星期和不计其数的奇怪念头打交道，他们知道开士米绒线在女人心中掀起的每个涟漪。不管是夫人、年轻女人，年轻的居家母亲、尊贵的商人的太太、轻浮女子、公爵夫人、不知羞耻的芭蕾舞者、天真少女还是过分天真的外国女人，都可能光顾商店，但是从她把手放在店门把手上那一刻起就在被观察之列了。她的品味一眼就被七八个店员估摸到了。这些店员站在窗户边、柜台旁、门口、墙角以及店中央，从表面看上去像是在策划周末假日的狂饮闹宴。你看着他们时会不自觉地问自己：“他们在想什么呢？”一眨眼的功夫，女人的钱包、愿望、意图和念头全都被搜了出来，比在边境花一小时三刻钟搜查一辆旅游马车来得还要彻底。这些精明的无赖什么都不会落下。他们站在那里严肃得像尊贵的神父站在台上一样，审视着顾客着装的每一个细节；小靴上不显眼的泥点，过时的帽檐，弄脏的或不搭配的帽带，服装的样式，手套使用的年头。他们能看出这件礼服是否出自维多利亚四世（注：一个女裁缝的绰号）手下灵巧的剪刀；他们能认出时髦的小饰品或弗罗芒·默里斯商店的首饰。总而言之，凡是能显露妇女的特点、财富以及性格的细节都不会被遗漏。</td>
		<td class="en">But to return to the young assistants, to the beribboned man of forty whom the King of the French receives at his table, to the red-bearded head of the department with his autocrat’s air.Week by week these meritus Gaudissarts are brought in contact with whims past counting; they know every vibration of the cashmere chord in the heart of woman.No one, be she lady or lorette, a young mother of a family, a respectable tradesman’s wife, a woman of easy virtue, a duchess or a brazen-fronted ballet-dancer, an innocent young girl or a too innocent foreigner, can appear in the shop, but she is watched from the moment when she first lays her fingers upon the door-handle.Her measure is taken at a glance by seven or eight men that stand, in the windows, at the counter, by the door, in a corner, in the middle of the shop, meditating, to all appearance, on the joys of a bacchanalian Sunday holiday.As you look at them, you ask yourself involuntarily, “What can they be thinking about?”Well, in the space of one second, a woman’s purse, wishes, intentions, and whims are ransacked more thoroughly than a traveling carriage at a frontier in an hour and three-quarters.Nothing is lost on these intelligent rogues.As they stand, solemn as noble fathers on the stage, they take in all the details of a fair customer’s dress; an invisible speck of mud on a little shoe, an antiquated hat-brim, soiled or ill-judged bonnet-strings, the fashion of the dress, the age of a pair of gloves.They can tell whether the gown was cut by the intelligent scissors of a Victorine IV.; they know a modish gewgaw or a trinket from Froment—Meurice.Nothing, in short, which can reveal a woman’s quality, fortune, or character passes unremarked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在他们面前您会感到焦虑。由店主领导这些戈迪萨尔组成的最高议院从来没有失误过。此外，他们彼此之间以电报的速度交流结论，只要一个眼神，一个微笑，肌肉的一抽，嘴唇的一拉。看着他们您会想起黄昏时香榭丽舍大街路灯突然亮起的样子；但燃气从点燃一个路灯到下一个路灯的速度远没有店员之间用眼神传递信息的速度快。</td>
		<td class="en">Tremble before them.Never was the Sanhedrim of Gaudissarts, with their chief at their head, known to make a mistake.And, moreover, they communicate their conclusions to one another with telegraphic speed, in a glance, a smile, the movement of a muscle, a twitch of the lip.If you watch them, you are reminded of the sudden outbreak of light along the Champs-Elysees at dusk; one gas-jet does not succeed another more swiftly than an idea flashes from one shopman’s eyes to the next.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果进来的是位英国女士，那位皮肤黝黑、神秘莫测、装腔作势的戈迪萨尔就会立刻走上前来，像拜伦诗歌里浪漫的主人公一样。</td>
		<td class="en">At once, if the lady is English, the dark, mysterious, portentous Gaudissart advances like a romantic character out of one of Byron’s poems.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果进来的是位都市女性，最年长的店员就会上前去招呼她。一刻钟内他便能拿出上百条披肩；他展示各种色彩和样式，引得顾客的头随它们转来转去；他为女士每展示一条披肩，就像风筝在不幸的兔子周围划出一个圆圈；半小时过后，顾客感到头晕目眩，自己完全拿不定主意了。尊贵的女士的所有想法都得到了迎合，只有把问题交给店员，而这位店员立即把她带入到一个两难境地，就是从两条同样难以拒绝的围巾中选出一条。</td>
		<td class="en">If she is a city madam, the oldest is put forward.He brings out a hundred shawls in fifteen minutes; he turns her head with colors and patterns; every shawl that he shows her is like a circle described by a kite wheeling round a hapless rabbit, till at the end of half an hour, when her head is swimming and she is utterly incapable of making a decision for herself, the good lady, meeting with a flattering response to all her ideas, refers the question to the assistant, who promptly leaves her on the horns of a dilemma between two equally irresistible shawls.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“夫人，这条披肩非常漂亮——苹果绿，本季的流行色；不过，潮流也一直在变；而这条黑白披肩，可别错过好机会，它从来不会过时，而且和任何衣服都可以搭配。”</td>

		<td class="en">“You would not believe how much eloquence is wanted in that beastly line,” the head Gaudissart of this particular establishment remarked quite lately to two acquaintances (Duronceret and Bixiou) who had come trusting in his judgment to buy a shawl.“Look here; you are artists and discreet, I can tell you about the governor’s tricks, and of all the men I ever saw, he is the cleverest.I do not mean as a manufacturer, there M. Fritot is first; but as a salesman.He discovered the ‘Selim shawl,’ AN ABSOLUTELY UNSALABLE article, yet we never bring it out but we sell it.We keep always a shawl worth five or six hundred francs in a cedar-wood box, perfectly plain outside, but lined with satin.It is one of the shawls that Selim sent to the Emperor Napoleon.It is our Imperial Guard; it is brought to the front whenever the day is almost lost; il se vend et ne meurt pas—it sells its life dearly time after time.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">As he spoke, an Englishwoman stepped from her jobbed carriage and appeared in all the glory of that phlegmatic humor peculiar to Britain and to all its products which make believe they are alive.The apparition put you in mind of the Commandant’s statue in Don Juan, it walked along, jerkily by fits and starts, in an awkward fashion invented in London, and cultivated in every family with patriotic care.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“An Englishwoman!” he continued for Bixiou’s ear.“An Englishwoman is our Waterloo.There are women who slip through our fingers like eels; we catch them on the staircase.There are lorettes who chaff us, we join in the laugh, we have a hold on them because we give credit.There are sphinx-like foreign ladies; we take a quantity of shawls to their houses, and arrive at an understanding by flattery; but an Englishwoman!—you might as well attack the bronze statue of Louis Quatorze!That sort of woman turns shopping into an occupation, an amusement.She quizzes us, forsooth!”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Madame is fastidious, like all persons of taste,” said the head of the establishment, coming forward with that tradesman’s suavity in which pomposity is agreeably blended with subservience.The Englishwoman took up her eyeglass and scanned the manufacturer from head to foot, unwilling to understand that the man before her was eligible for Parliament and dined at the Tuileries.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我还有最后一条披肩，”店主继续说道，“但我从来没给人看过。这条披肩不符合一般人的品味，它非常特别。我原打算送给我妻子的。自1805年起，我们就一直保存着它；它曾属于约瑟芬皇后。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I have only one shawl left,” he continued, “but I never show it.It is not to everybody’s taste; it is quite out of the common.I was thinking of giving it to my wife.We have had it in stock since 1805; it belonged to the Empress Josephine.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >店主小心翼翼地拿出一把极小的钥匙打开了一个雪松木方盒。那种谨慎可能连德累斯顿的绿穹博物馆的看守也会称赞。盒子的外形和朴素的风格给英国妇女留下了非常深刻的印象。店主从这个带有黑色缎子内衬的盒子里拿出一条价值约一千五百法郎的披肩，金黄色底上有黑色图案，只有印第安人用其惊人的想象力造就出的彩绘才能胜过这鲜艳的色彩。</td>
		<td class="en">With precautions, which a custodian of the Dresden Grune Gewolbe might have admired, he took out an infinitesimal key and opened a square cedar-wood box.The Englishwoman was much impressed with its shape and plainness.From that box, lined with black satin, he drew a shawl worth about fifteen hundred francs, a black pattern on a golden-yellow ground, of which the startling color was only surpassed by the surprising efforts of the Indian imagination.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“太好了，”女士用法语和英语的混合口音说，“这真是太漂亮了。它就是我想要的披肩，非常华丽。”余下的话都淹没在她故作太太的姿态中，目的是为了展示她那双自以为很漂亮却冷冰冰的眼睛。</td>
		<td class="en">“Splendid,” said the lady, in a mixture of French and English, “it is really handsome.Just my ideal (ideol) of a shawl; it is very magnificent.”The rest was lost in a madonna’s pose assumed for the purpose of displaying a pair of frigid eyes which she believed to be very fine.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“十分偏爱。”英国妇女用她那英国口音重复道。接着把披肩披在自己的肩上，看着镜子中的自己。店主又把披肩拿到光亮处，团在手里，然后铺平，展示披肩的光彩，动作好似李斯特在弹钢琴。</td>
		<td class="en">“A great favorite,” repeated she with her English accent.Then she arranged the shawl about her shoulders and looked at herself in the glass.The proprietor took it to the light, gathered it up in his hands, smoothed it out, showed the gloss on it, played on it as Liszt plays on the pianoforte keys.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“夫人，我有一条非常漂亮的披肩，”店主依旧很平静地说，“它曾是俄国一位公主的，那兹科夫公主；她把这披肩留给我用来抵付从我这儿拿走的商品。如果夫人愿意去看一下，您一定会感到非常惊异的。这披肩是新的，总共用了不超过十天，这类披肩在巴黎仅此一条。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I have a very handsome one, madame,” said the proprietor with unshaken composure; “it belonged to a Russian princess, the Princess Narzicof; she left it with me in payment for goods received.If madame would like to see it, she would be astonished.It is new; it has not been in use altogether for ten days; there is not its like in Paris.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Oh, I saw what she was, an eccentric woman that loves to be conspicuous.As soon as she saw that every one stared at her, she said, ‘Keep your carriage, monsieur, my mind is made up; I will take the shawl.’While M. Bigorneau (indicating the romantic-looking assistant) was serving, I watched her carefully; she kept one eye on you all the time to see what you thought of her; she was thinking more about you than of the shawls.Englishwomen are peculiar in their DISTASTE (for one cannot call it taste); they do not know what they want; they make up their minds to be guided by circumstances at the time, and not by their own choice.I saw the kind of woman at once, tired of her husband, tired of her brats, regretfully virtuous, craving excitement, always posing as a weeping willow....”</td></tr>
