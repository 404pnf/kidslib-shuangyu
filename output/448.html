		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从前，在一个遥远的东方国家住着一位国王，他十分喜欢打猎，一旦发现鹿，他就会不顾自身安危，前去追赶。</td>
		<td class="en">Once upon a time, far away in the east country, there lived a king who loved hunting so much that, when once there was a deer in sight, he was careless of his own safety.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >事实上，他尤其喜欢独自一人去冒险，所以他常常会撇下自己的贵族和随从们，独自行动。</td>
		<td class="en">Indeed, he often became quite separated from his nobles and attendants, and in fact was particularly fond of lonely adventures.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的另一个爱好则是放出消息说自己身体不好，不能接见任何人。只有他忠诚的大臣瓦齐尔知道，他会把自己打扮成一个小商贩，牵着一头驮着便宜货物的驴子四处游走。</td>
		<td class="en">Another of his favourite amusements was to give out that he was not well, and could not be seen; and then, with the knowledge only of his faithful Grand Wazeer, to disguise himself as a pedlar, load a donkey with cheap wares, and travel about.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这样他就能知道平民百姓对他的评价，还有他的法官和地方官员任务完成得如何。</td>
		<td class="en">In this way he found out what the common people said about him, and how his judges and governors fulfilled their duties.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天，他的王后为他生下了一个如黎明般漂亮的女儿。国王高兴极了，有整整一个星期都忘记了打猎，同民众和家人共同欢庆女儿的诞生。</td>
		<td class="en">One day his queen presented him with a baby daughter as beautiful as the dawn, and the king himself was so happy and delighted that, for a whole week, he forgot to hunt, and spent the time in public and private rejoicing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而没过多久，他又出去追捕在森林深处发现的一些鹿了。</td>
		<td class="en">Not long afterwards, however, he went out after some deer which were to be found in a far corner of his forests.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在捕猎过程中，他的猎狗惊扰了一只美丽的雄鹿，它浑身像雪一样白。国王一看见它，就下定决心无论如何都要抓到它。</td>
		<td class="en">In the course of the beat his dogs disturbed a beautiful snow-white stag, and directly he saw it the king determined that he would have it at any cost.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是他挥鞭策马，全速追赶它。</td>
		<td class="en">So he put the spurs to his horse, and followed it as hard as he could gallop.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当然他所有的随从都以最快的速度跟在他身后，但是国王骑术高超，鹿的速度也非常快，所以一个小时后，国王发现只有他和自己心爱的猎犬还在追赶，其他人都被甩在后面，不见人影了。</td>
		<td class="en">Of course all his attendants followed at the best speed that they could manage; but the king was so splendidly mounted, and the stag was so swift, that, at the end of an hour, the king found that only his favourite hound and himself were in the chase; all the rest were far, far behind and out of sight.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，国王仍然毫不畏惧地继续追赶，直到他发现自己进入了一个四周都是岩石的山谷。这时他的马已经十分劳累了，每走一步都在颤抖。</td>
		<td class="en">Nothing daunted, however, he went on and on, till he perceived that he was entering a valley with great rocky mountains on all sides, and that his horse was getting very tired and trembled at every stride.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >更糟的是，天色已经渐渐暗了下来，太阳很快就要落山了。</td>
		<td class="en">Worse than all evening was already drawing on, and the sun would soon set.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他向漂亮的雄鹿射了一箭又一箭，但那都是徒劳。</td>
		<td class="en">In vain had he sent arrow after arrow at the beautiful stag.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >射出的箭离目标不是太近，就是太远，最后天色完全暗了下来，他也完全看不到雄鹿的踪迹了。</td>
		<td class="en">Every shot fell short, or went wide of the mark; and at last, just as darkness was setting in, he lost sight altogether of the beast.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >此时，他的马已经累得迈不开步子了，他的猎犬也喘着粗气，一瘸一拐地跟在他身边。他闯入了以前从未到过的大山中，已经完全迷了路，也看不见任何人迹和住所。</td>
		<td class="en">By this time his horse could hardly move from fatigue, his hound staggered panting along beside him, he was far away amongst mountains where he had never been before, and had quite missed his way, and not a human creature or dwelling was in sight.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管情况很糟糕，但是国王并不在意，只是因为没猎到美丽的雄鹿而感到懊恼。</td>
		<td class="en">All this was very discouraging, but the king would not have minded if he had not lost that beautiful stag.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管那使他感到懊恼，但是他从不为自己无能为力的事而忧虑。于是他翻身下马，用手臂拽着缰绳，牵着马沿着崎岖的小道行走，希望能发现一个牧羊人的小屋，或者至少找到一个可以勉强过夜的山洞或是岩石下的休息处。</td>
		<td class="en">That troubled him a good deal, but he never worried over what he could not help, so he got down from his horse, slipped his arm through the bridle, and led the animal along the rough path in hopes of discovering some shepherd’s hut, or, at least, a cave or shelter under some rock, where he might pass the night.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不久他听见了哗哗的流水声，便朝着声音发出的方向走去。</td>
		<td class="en">Presently he heard the sound of rushing water, and made towards it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他吃力地爬过了山丘上一个陡峭的山肩，下方有一条小溪沿着险峻的峡谷奔流而下，而几乎在他脚下，溪水的表面有亮光闪烁，那是一盏灯发出的暗淡的灯光映在了水面上。</td>
		<td class="en">He toiled over a steep rocky shoulder of a hill, and there, just below him, was a stream dashing down a precipitous glen, and, almost beneath his feet, twinkling and flickering from the level of the torrent, was a dim light as of a lamp.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >国王牵着马和猎狗朝着灯光走去，沿着一个陡峭多石的小道踉踉跄跄地往下走。</td>
		<td class="en">Towards this light the king with his horse and hound made his way, sliding and stumbling down a steep, stony path.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在小道的尽头，国王发现小溪边上有一个狭窄的岩架，上面长满了青草，岩架的尽头有一个山洞，洞顶上挂着一盏简陋的灯笼，它发出的灯光忽明忽暗，照亮了一大片地方。</td>
		<td class="en">At the bottom the king found a narrow grassy ledge by the brink of the stream, across which the light from a rude lantern in the mount of a cave shed a broad beam of uncertain light.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >小溪边上坐着一位上了年纪的隐士，他蓄着长长的白胡子。当国王走近时，他既没有说话也没有移动，只是坐在那里，把散落在身边的干树叶捡起来扔进小溪里。</td>
		<td class="en">At the edge of the stream sat an old hermit with a long white beard, who neither spoke nor moved as the king approached, but sat throwing into the stream dry leaves which lay scattered about the ground near him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“愿你平安。”国王按照在乡下通常用的方式向他问好。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Peace be upon you,’ said the king, giving the usual country salutation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“也祝你平安。”隐士回答说，但是他始终没有抬头看国王，也没有停下手里的活。</td>
		<td class="en">‘And upon you peace,’ answered the hermit; but still he never looked up, nor stopped what he was doing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >国王在那里站了一两分钟，一直看着他。</td>
		<td class="en">For a minute or two the king stood watching him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他注意到，隐士每次会扔两片树叶，然后聚精会神地看着它们。</td>
		<td class="en">He noticed that the hermit threw two leaves in at a time, and watched them attentively.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有时两片树叶会很快被溪水冲走，有时只有一片树叶被冲走，而另一片则在水流的边缘慢慢地打转，然后围着一个漩涡转圈，最后又冲回隐者脚边。</td>
		<td class="en">Sometimes both were carried rapidly down by the stream; sometimes only one leaf was carried off, and the other, after whirling slowly round and round on the edge of the current, would come circling back on an eddy to the hermit’s feet.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >还有的时候，两片叶子都陷入反方向的漩涡中，无法进入哗哗直响的小溪。</td>
		<td class="en">At other times both leaves were held in the backward eddy, and failed to reach the main current of the noisy stream.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你在做什么？”国王终于问道。隐士回答说他在给人们算命，他说，每个人的命运一开始就是注定的，而且无论命运是什么，人们都无法逃脱。</td>
		<td class="en">‘What are you doing?’ asked the king at last, and the hermit replied that he was reading the fates of men; every one’s fate, he said, was settled from the beginning, and, whatever it were, there was no escape from it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >国王笑了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">The king laughed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我的命运如何，我倒是不在乎，”他说，“但是我很想知道我小女儿的命运。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘I care little,’ he said, ‘what my fate may be; but I should be curious to know the fate of my little daughter.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不能说。”隐士回答。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I cannot say,’ answered the hermit.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那就是你不知道了？”国王质问到。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Do you not know, then?’ demanded the king.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我或许知道，”隐士回答，“但是知道太多总是不明智的。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘I might know,’ returned the hermit, ‘but it is not always wisdom to know much.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是国王对这个回答并不满意，他开始劝老人说出知道的事情，可是劝了好久老人都不肯说。</td>
		<td class="en">But the king was not content with this reply, and began to press the old man to say what he knew, which for a long time he would not do.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >最后国王极力劝说他，他才肯说：</td>
		<td class="en">At last, however, the king urged him so greatly that he said:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“国王的女儿会嫁给一个穷苦女奴的儿子，她叫普鲁娜，是北土国王的奴隶。</td>
		<td class="en">‘The king’s daughter will marry the son of a poor slave-girl called Puruna, who belongs to the king of the land of the north.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这是无法逃离的命运。”</td>
		<td class="en">There is no escaping from Fate.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >国王听到这些话，简直要气疯了，但他实在太累了，所以他只是笑了笑，说不管怎样希望能有逃脱这个命运的办法。</td>
		<td class="en">The king was wild with anger at hearing these words, but he was also very tired; so he only laughed, and answered that he hoped there would be a way out of THAT fate anyhow.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >随后，他问隐士能不能留他和带来的牲畜住一晚，隐士答应了。于是国王很快给马饮足水，把它拴好，自己吃了面包和烤豆子当晚饭，然后躺在山洞里，让猎狗躺在他脚边，努力想要进入梦乡。</td>
		<td class="en">Then he asked if the hermit could shelter him and his beasts for the night, and the hermit said ‘Yes’; so, very soon the king had watered and tethered his horse, and, after a supper of bread and parched peas, lay down in the cave, with the hound at his feet, and tried to go to sleep.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是他躺在那里，想着隐士的预言，怎么也睡不着，而且他越想越生气，最后他咬牙切齿地说这绝对，绝对不会发生。</td>
		<td class="en">But instead of sleeping he only lay awake and thought of the hermit’s prophecy; and the more he thought of it the angrier he felt, until he gnashed his teeth and declared that it should never, never come true.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >天亮了，国王起了床，他脸色苍白、闷闷不乐。在问了隐士该走哪条路之后，他很快翻身上马，毫不费劲地找到了回家的路。</td>
		<td class="en">Morning came, and the king got up, pale and sulky, and, after learning from the hermit which path to take, was soon mounted and found his way home without much difficulty.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他一回到宫中就给北土国王写了封信，恳请他把女奴普鲁娜和她的儿子卖给他。他还在信中说，如果北土国王同意了，他会派一名信使到两国交界的河边接他们。</td>
		<td class="en">Directly he reached his palace he wrote a letter to the king of the land of the north, begging him, as a favour, to sell him his slave girl Puruna and her son, and saying that, if he consented, he would send a messenger to receive them at the river which divided the kingdoms.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他等回信等了有五天，这期间一直寝食难安，而且十分焦躁。</td>
		<td class="en">For five days he awaited the reply, and hardly slept or ate, but was as cross as could be all the time.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第五天，他的信使带来了回信，北土国王在信上说国王不必花钱来买女奴和她的儿子，他会把那对母子直接送给国王。</td>
		<td class="en">On the fifth day his messenger returned with a letter to say that the king of the land of the north would not sell, but he would give, the king the slave girl and her son.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >国王喜出望外。</td>
		<td class="en">The king was overjoyed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他找来大臣瓦齐尔，说他要独自一人出行，让瓦齐尔编个借口来解释他为什么不在宫中。</td>
		<td class="en">He sent for his Grand Wazeer and told him that he was going on one of his lonely expeditions, and that the Wazeer must invent some excuse to account for his absence.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后他化装成一名普通的信使，骑上一匹敏捷的骆驼，迅速赶往接女奴的地方。</td>
		<td class="en">Next he disguised himself as an ordinary messenger, mounted a swift camel, and sped away to the place where the slave girl was to be handed over to him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >到了那里后，他交给带来女奴的信使一封向北土国王表示感谢的信、一份给他们主人的丰厚礼物，还有给信使的奖赏。然后，他立马把那个可怜的女人和她的小婴儿抱上骆驼，向一片荒漠驶去。</td>
		<td class="en">When he got there he gave the messengers who brought her a letter of thanks and a handsome present for their master and rewards for themselves; and then without delay he took the poor woman and her tiny baby-boy up on to his camel and rode off to a wild desert.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在走了整整一天一夜后，他来到一个大洞穴，在那里把女人抱下马，把她和婴儿拽到洞里去，然后他拔出剑来，一剑砍下了她的脑袋。</td>
		<td class="en">After riding for a day and a night, almost without stopping, he came to a great cave where he made the woman dismount, and, taking her and the baby into the cave, he drew his sword and with one blow chopped her head off.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管他在怒火的驱使下能做出各种残忍可怕的事情，国王还是觉得不能杀死一个无助的婴儿。他深信这婴儿失去了母亲，很快就会死在这个荒无人烟的地方，于是他把婴儿留在了山洞里，然后骑上骆驼，飞快地回家了。</td>
		<td class="en">But although his anger made him cruel enough for anything so dreadful, the king felt that he could not turn his great sword on the helpless baby, who he was sure must soon die in this solitary place without its mother; so he left it in the cave where it was, and, mounting his camel, rode home as fast as he could.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在国王领土上的一个小村庄里，住着一个年迈的寡妇，她没有孩子，也没有任何亲人。</td>
		<td class="en">Now, in a small village in his kingdom there lived an old widow who had no children or relations of any kind.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">She made her living mostly by selling the milk of a flock of goats; but she was very, very poor, and not very strong, and often used to wonder how she would live if she got too weak or ill to attend to her goats.</td></tr>
