		<td class="en">CHAPTER I. TOM SEEKS NEW ADVENTURES </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >你是否认为汤姆·索耶在经历了之前的种种冒险之后会感到心满意足呢？我是指我们沿河经历的冒险，我们让黑人吉姆获得自由而汤姆腿部还中弹的那次。不，他尚未满足。那只能让他越陷越深。这就是之前那些冒险产生的全部效应。你知道，当我们三人经历了可以说是漫长的旅行并满载荣耀回到河流上游时，村民们擎着火炬、列队成行迎接我们时，他们议论纷纷，每个人都欢呼雀跃，这令我们成为英雄人物，而这也是汤姆·索耶一直梦寐以求的。</td>
		<td class="en">Do you reckon Tom Sawyer was satisfied after all them adventures?I mean the adventures we had down the river, and the time we set the darky Jim free and Tom got shot in the leg.No, he wasn’t.It only just p’isoned him for more.That was all the effect it had.You see, when we three came back up the river in glory, as you may say, from that long travel, and the village received us with a torchlight procession and speeches, and everybody hurrah’d and shouted, it made us heroes, and that was what Tom Sawyer had always been hankering to be.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有那么一阵子，他确实是心满意足的。每个人都很关注他，而他则扬着头，在镇上四处闲逛，好像他拥有这镇子一般。有人称呼他“旅行者汤姆·索耶”，而这恰好令他的虚荣心膨胀到快要爆炸了。如你所知，他远胜于我和吉姆，因为我们只不过是乘筏顺流而下再乘汽船回来，而汤姆往返都是乘坐汽船。男孩儿们非常羡慕我和吉姆，但是天哪！他们却直接拜倒在汤姆脚下。</td>
		<td class="en">For a while he WAS satisfied.Everybody made much of him, and he tilted up his nose and stepped around the town as though he owned it.Some called him Tom Sawyer the Traveler, and that just swelled him up fit to bust.You see he laid over me and Jim considerable, because we only went down the river on a raft and came back by the steamboat, but Tom went by the steamboat both ways.The boys envied me and Jim a good deal, but land!They just knuckled to the dirt before TOM.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >好吧，我说不好；要不是因为老纳特·帕森斯——那个身体健壮、身材修长、还算心地善良，但因为年纪大了也会犯糊涂的秃头邮政局长——这个我所见过最能说会道的老家伙，汤姆也许会感到满足的。在长达三十年的时间里，他是村里唯一一个享有名望的人——我是指身为旅行者而享有的名望，他自然对此颇为自豪，据估算，在那三十年间，他谈论他自己的旅行超过一百万次，并且每次都乐在其中。而现在，冒出一个不足十五岁的小男孩，他的旅行令所有人都瞠目结舌又羡慕不已，这恰好给这可怜的老人造成极大的打击。这使得他讨厌听汤姆说话，也讨厌听到人们感慨“我的天哪”、“不会吧”、“看在老天爷的份上！”等等诸如此类的话；但他就像后腿被牢牢黏在糖浆上的苍蝇一样，无法摆脱这一切。每当汤姆的故事告一段落，那可怜的老人就会趁机讲起他那些老套的旅行故事，并且尽可能把它们讲得精彩纷呈；但它们已全无新意，起不了什么作用，那场景看起来真叫人同情。接着又会轮到汤姆，然后又是那老人家——如此这般反复，要花上一个多小时，两人都试图击败对方。</td>
		<td class="en">Well, I don’t know; maybe he might have been satisfied if it hadn’t been for old Nat Parsons, which was postmaster, and powerful long and slim, and kind o’ good-hearted and silly, and bald-headed, on account of his age, and about the talkiest old cretur I ever see.For as much as thirty years he’d been the only man in the village that had a reputation—I mean a reputation for being a traveler, and of course he was mortal proud of it, and it was reckoned that in the course of that thirty years he had told about that journey over a million times and enjoyed it every time.And now comes along a boy not quite fifteen, and sets everybody admiring and gawking over HIS travels, and it just give the poor old man the high strikes.It made him sick to listen to Tom, and to hear the people say “My land” “Did you ever!” “My goodness sakes alive!” and all such things; but he couldn’t pull away from it, any more than a fly that’s got its hind leg fast in the molasses.And always when Tom come to a rest, the poor old cretur would chip in on HIS same old travels and work them for all they were worth; but they were pretty faded, and didn’t go for much, and it was pitiful to see.And then Tom would take another innings, and then the old man again—and so on, and so on, for an hour and more, each trying to beat out the other.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >你听听，帕森斯的旅行是这样的：当他初为邮政局长时，他对这一行很陌生，那时来了一封信，寄给一个他不知道的人，而村里也没有这个人。好吧，他不知该如何是好，也不知道如何采取措施，于是那封信就一直搁着，一周又一周，直到他只要看一眼那封信就会变得歇斯底里。信件的邮费尚未支付，这是另一件叫人担忧的事。那十美分无处收取，他想着政府可能让他对此负责，当他们发现他没有收取那些钱时，他可能会丢掉工作。好吧，最后他再也忍受不了了。他睡不着觉，也吃不下饭，消瘦不堪，然而他没有征求别人的建议，因为给他建议的那个人可能会背叛他，让政府知道那封信的事。他把那封信埋在地板下，但那样也无济于事；要是碰巧看见有人站在埋信的地方，他就会直打寒颤，心中充满怀疑，晚上不睡觉，等到镇上夜深人静时，他便会悄悄溜到那儿把信取出来，再埋到另一个地方。当然了，因为他观望的样子和做事的方式，人们逐渐开始回避他，摇头低语，他们判断他杀了人，或是做了什么他们不知道的可怕的事，如果他是个陌生人，他们早就动用私刑绞死他了。</td>
		<td class="en">You see, Parsons’ travels happened like this: When he first got to be postmaster and was green in the business, there come a letter for somebody he didn’t know, and there wasn’t any such person in the village.Well, he didn’t know what to do, nor how to act, and there the letter stayed and stayed, week in and week out, till the bare sight of it gave him a conniption.The postage wasn’t paid on it, and that was another thing to worry about.There wasn’t any way to collect that ten cents, and he reckon’d the gov’ment would hold him responsible for it and maybe turn him out besides, when they found he hadn’t collected it.Well, at last he couldn’t stand it any longer.He couldn’t sleep nights, he couldn’t eat, he was thinned down to a shadder, yet he da’sn’t ask anybody’s advice, for the very person he asked for advice might go back on him and let the gov’ment know about the letter.He had the letter buried under the floor, but that did no good; if he happened to see a person standing over the place it’d give him the cold shivers, and loaded him up with suspicions, and he would sit up that night till the town was still and dark, and then he would sneak there and get it out and bury it in another place.Of course, people got to avoiding him and shaking their heads and whispering, because, the way he was looking and acting, they judged he had killed somebody or done something terrible, they didn’t know what, and if he had been a stranger they would’ve lynched him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >好吧，如我刚才所说，事情变得令他再也无法忍受了，于是他下定决心离开镇子去华盛顿找美国总统将整件事和盘托出，然后他要交出那封信，把它放在政府官员面前说，“现在，信在这里了——我任凭你们处置，尽管天可以为我作证，我是无辜的，不应受到法律的制裁，丢下我那与此事毫无关系的一家老小，忍饥受饿，这就是全部真相，我可以发誓。”</td>
		<td class="en">Well, as I was saying, it got so he couldn’t stand it any longer; so he made up his mind to pull out for Washington, and just go to the President of the United States and make a clean breast of the whole thing, not keeping back an atom, and then fetch the letter out and lay it before the whole gov’ment, and say, “Now, there she is—do with me what you’re a mind to; though as heaven is my judge I am an innocent man and not deserving of the full penalties of the law and leaving behind me a family that must starve and yet hadn’t had a thing to do with it, which is the whole truth and I can swear to it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是他这么做了。</td>
		<td class="en">So he did it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他先是乘坐小型汽船，又坐了一段驿站马车，然后骑马走完剩下的路程，花了三周时间抵达华盛顿。他看到了广袤的土地、许多村庄，还有四座城市。他离开了将近八个星期，而当他回来的时候，那股骄傲劲是村里其他人都不曾有过的。他的旅行使他成为整个地区最伟大、也最为人们津津乐道的人物，人们从远在三十英里以外的乡村和伊利诺伊州低地来，仅仅为了见见他——他们站在那里呆呆地看着，而他则叽里咕噜地说个不停。你从未见过这样的场面。</td>
		<td class="en">He had a little wee bit of steamboating, and some stage-coaching, but all the rest of the way was horseback, and it took him three weeks to get to Washington.He saw lots of land and lots of villages and four cities.He was gone ’most eight weeks, and there never was such a proud man in the village as he when he got back.His travels made him the greatest man in all that region, and the most talked about; and people come from as much as thirty miles back in the country, and from over in the Illinois bottoms, too, just to look at him—and there they’d stand and gawk, and he’d gabble.You never see anything like it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >唉，现在还没有任何办法能确定谁是最伟大的旅行者，有人说是纳特，也有人说是汤姆。人人都承认纳特的旅行经度跨度最大，但他们又不得不妥协于，汤姆的旅行纬度和气候区的跨度弥补了其经度跨度较小的不足。双方几乎处于僵持状态，于是他们都不得不渲染其旅途的惊险，并试图以这种方式取得优势。应对汤姆腿上中弹留下的伤口对纳特·帕森斯而言，是件非常棘手的事情，但是他还是竭尽全力应对；然而也有对汤姆不利的情况，说句公道话，他不像料想中那样坐得住，而总是起来四处闲逛，每当纳特描绘他在华盛顿的冒险时，他就故意瘸着腿走过，因此，即使汤姆的腿已经痊愈，他也绝不正常地走路，他晚上在家练习，始终保持着受伤时走路的样子。</td>
		<td class="en">Well, there wasn’t any way now to settle which was the greatest traveler; some said it was Nat, some said it was Tom.Everybody allowed that Nat had seen the most longitude, but they had to give in that whatever Tom was short in longitude he had made up in latitude and climate.It was about a stand-off; so both of them had to whoop up their dangerous adventures, and try to get ahead THAT way.That bullet-wound in Tom’s leg was a tough thing for Nat Parsons to buck against, but he bucked the best he could; and at a disadvantage, too, for Tom didn’t set still as he’d orter done, to be fair, but always got up and sauntered around and worked his limp while Nat was painting up the adventure that HE had in Washington; for Tom never let go that limp when his leg got well, but practiced it nights at home, and kept it good as new right along.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >纳特的冒险就是如此；我不知道它的可信度有多高，也许他是从报纸上或是其它什么地方看来的，但我要为他说句话，那就是他确实知道如何来讲他的故事。当他讲故事时，他会脸色煞白，屏住呼吸，让所有的人都毛骨悚然，有时候，妇人和姑娘们听得发虚，甚至无法坚持把故事听完。嗯，我记得最近一次，他是这样说的。</td>
		<td class="en">Nat’s adventure was like this; I don’t know how true it is; maybe he got it out of a paper, or somewhere, but I will say this for him, that he DID know how to tell it.He could make anybody’s flesh crawl, and he’d turn pale and hold his breath when he told it, and sometimes women and girls got so faint they couldn’t stick it out.Well, it was this way, as near as I can remember: </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他骑着马大步跑向华盛顿，拴好马，带着信推推搡搡地来到总统府，人们告诉他总统在国会大厦，而且正准备前往费城——如果他想赶上总统，就一刻也不能耽搁。纳特几乎精疲力竭了，非常难受。他的马被拴起来了，他不知该如何是好。但就在此时，沿路来了个黑人，驾着一辆破旧的马车，他发现机会来了。他冲过去，喊道：“如果你在半小时之内把我送到国会大厦，我就给你50美分，如果你能在20分钟内送到，再加25美分！”</td>
		<td class="en">He come a-loping into Washington, and put up his horse and shoved out to the President’s house with his letter, and they told him the President was up to the Capitol, and just going to start for Philadelphia—not a minute to lose if he wanted to catch him.Nat ’most dropped, it made him so sick.His horse was put up, and he didn’t know what to do.But just then along comes a darky driving an old ramshackly hack, and he see his chance.He rushes out and shouts: “A half a dollar if you git me to the Capitol in half an hour, and a quarter extra if you do it in twenty minutes!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“成交！”那黑人说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Done!” says the darky.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >纳特跳上车，使劲关上车门，马车便在那条人们见过的最凹凸不平的路上横冲直撞地开走了，还发出吓人的声响。纳特将手臂穿过车把手，死死抓住，但一转眼，马车撞到了一块石头，飞到空中，车的底部脱落了，当车子着地后，纳特的脚也碰到了地面，他发现如果他跟不上马车，他就命悬一线了。他大吃一惊，拼命地跑，双手紧紧抓着把手，双脚都要飞起来了。他大声吼叫让车夫停下来，沿路的人们也喊着让车夫停下来，因为他们看到他的腿在马车下疾驰，透过车窗还能看见他的头和肩膀在车内乱晃，他的处境十分危险，但人们越是喊，那黑人就越是快马加鞭，嚷着：“别担心，我会让你赶到的，老板，我正这么做呢，驾！”你知道了吧，他以为大家都在催他快一点，当然了，马车的嘈杂声也让他什么都听不到。于是他们全速前进，所有人都看得目瞪口呆；当他们最终到达国会大厦时，所有人都说这是有史以来最快的旅行。马倒下了，纳特也精疲力尽地瘫倒在地，他满身尘土、衣衫褴褛，还光着脚；但他赶到了，刚刚好赶到，他追上总统，把信给他，一切都进展顺利，总统当场赦免了他，纳特额外给了那黑人50美分，而不是25美分，因为他知道要不是他搭上了这辆马车，他不可能及时赶到这里，怕是连离这里不远的地方都到不了。</td>
		<td class="en">Nat he jumped in and slammed the door, and away they went a-ripping and a-tearing over the roughest road a body ever see, and the racket of it was something awful.Nat passed his arms through the loops and hung on for life and death, but pretty soon the hack hit a rock and flew up in the air, and the bottom fell out, and when it come down Nat’s feet was on the ground, and he see he was in the most desperate danger if he couldn’t keep up with the hack.He was horrible scared, but he laid into his work for all he was worth, and hung tight to the arm-loops and made his legs fairly fly.He yelled and shouted to the driver to stop, and so did the crowds along the street, for they could see his legs spinning along under the coach, and his head and shoulders bobbing inside through the windows, and he was in awful danger; but the more they all shouted the more the nigger whooped and yelled and lashed the horses and shouted, “Don’t you fret, I’se gwine to git you dah in time, boss; I’s gwine to do it, sho’!” for you see he thought they were all hurrying him up, and, of course, he couldn’t hear anything for the racket he was making.And so they went ripping along, and everybody just petrified to see it; and when they got to the Capitol at last it was the quickest trip that ever was made, and everybody said so.The horses laid down, and Nat dropped, all tuckered out, and he was all dust and rags and barefooted; but he was in time and just in time, and caught the President and give him the letter, and everything was all right, and the President give him a free pardon on the spot, and Nat give the nigger two extra quarters instead of one, because he could see that if he hadn’t had the hack he wouldn’t’a’ got there in time, nor anywhere near it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这的确是精彩纷呈的冒险，汤姆·索耶必须把他中弹受伤的故事讲得栩栩如生，才能与之抗衡。</td>
		<td class="en">It WAS a powerful good adventure, and Tom Sawyer had to work his bullet-wound mighty lively to hold his own against it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是，没过多久汤姆的荣光渐渐黯淡了，因为另外发生的事成了人们的谈资——先是一场赛马，然后是一处房子着了火，再然后有马戏表演和蚀；这一切如同往常一般再度流行起来，到那时，可以说人们已经不再谈论汤姆了，而你也从未见过谁像他这样难过与不快。</td>
		<td class="en">Well, by and by Tom’s glory got to paling down gradu’ly, on account of other things turning up for the people to talk about—first a horse-race, and on top of that a house afire, and on top of that the circus, and on top of that the eclipse; and that started a revival, same as it always does, and by that time there wasn’t any more talk about Tom, so to speak, and you never see a person so sick and disgusted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >很快，他开始日复一日地担忧与焦虑起来，当我问起他此时是什么心情时，他说想到时光飞逝，自己日渐衰老，却没有战争爆发，也不能让自己在有生之年声名鹊起，他就心碎不已。男孩们总是这么想的，但他是第一个我亲耳听见的把这个想法说出来的人。</td>
		<td class="en">Pretty soon he got to worrying and fretting right along day in and day out, and when I asked him what WAS he in such a state about, he said it ’most broke his heart to think how time was slipping away, and him getting older and older, and no wars breaking out and no way of making a name for himself that he could see.Now that is the way boys is always thinking, but he was the first one I ever heard come out and say it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因此他开始制定一个能让他美名远扬的计划；很快他有了主意，并邀请我和吉姆参与。汤姆·索亚总是这样随性与慷慨。当你有什么好事时，许多男孩都对你极其和善友好，可当好事发生在他们身上时，他们就对你只字不提，想全部霸占。汤姆·索耶从不这样，我可以为他这么说。当你得到一个苹果时，许多男孩都会满心渴望地来找你，对你卑躬屈膝，求你给他个核；可当他们自己有苹果了，若你向他们讨个核，并提醒他们你曾给过他们一个时，他们会感激涕零，但还是不会给你。但我发现他们总是答应会给；而你能做的只有干等着。</td>
		<td class="en">So then he set to work to get up a plan to make him celebrated; and pretty soon he struck it, and offered to take me and Jim in.Tom Sawyer was always free and generous that way.There’s a-plenty of boys that’s mighty good and friendly when YOU’VE got a good thing, but when a good thing happens to come their way they don’t say a word to you, and try to hog it all.That warn’t ever Tom Sawyer’s way, I can say that for him.There’s plenty of boys that will come hankering and groveling around you when you’ve got an apple and beg the core off of you; but when they’ve got one, and you beg for the core and remind them how you give them a core one time, they say thank you ’most to death, but there ain’t a-going to be no core.But I notice they always git come up with; all you got to do is to wait.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >好了，我们来到山上的林子里，然后汤姆告诉我们计划是什么。计划是一次新的十字军东征。</td>
		<td class="en">Well, we went out in the woods on the hill, and Tom told us what it was.It was a crusade.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“什么是十字军东征？”我问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“What’s a crusade?” I says.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他表情轻蔑,当他为谁感到羞愧时，他就是这副表情，他说：“赫克·芬恩，你是要告诉我你不知道什么是十字军东征吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">He looked scornful, the way he’s always done when he was ashamed of a person, and says: </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“赫克·芬恩，你是要告诉我你不知道什么是十字军东征吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Huck Finn, do you mean to tell me you don’t know what a crusade is?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，”我说道，“我不知道。再说我也不在乎。我不知道这件事也好好地活到现在，而且身体健康。不过你一告诉我，我就会知道了，一点儿也不晚。如果我可能没什么机会用到这些事情，那么我不觉得查明它们，用它们塞满我的大脑有什么价值。兰斯·威廉斯，他学习怎么和这里的乔克托族人说话，直到一个乔克托人来为他掘了坟墓。唉，好了，什么是十字军东征呢？不过在你说之前，我得先让告诉你；如果这是一项专利的话，可赚不到什么钱。比尔·汤普森,他——”</td>
		<td class="en">“No,” says I, “I don’t.And I don’t care to, nuther.I’ve lived till now and done without it, and had my health, too.But as soon as you tell me, I’ll know, and that’s soon enough.I don’t see any use in finding out things and clogging up my head with them when I mayn’t ever have any occasion to use ’em.There was Lance Williams, he learned how to talk Choctaw here till one come and dug his grave for him.Now, then, what’s a crusade?But I can tell you one thing before you begin; if it’s a patent-right, there’s no money in it.Bill Thompson he—” </td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >事实就是这样，它们就是这样发生的：每个人都按自己的方式来解释吧。我好好想了想这件事，觉得这其中有些是靠知识，但主要还是凭直觉。理由是这样的：汤姆把那块砖放进口袋里，想把它交给博物馆，并题上他的名字，但实际上，他回家后，我偷偷把它拿了出来，换成另一块和它极为相像的砖，可他却没有发现不同——但其中是有不同的，你知道的。我觉得这能解开这个疑惑——大部分是靠直觉，不是知识。直觉告诉他这块砖所处的准确位置，于是他在那里认出了它，而不是因为看到这块砖才认出它。如果是凭借知识，而不是直觉的话，当他再次见到这块砖时，他还能重新认出它——但他没认出来。所以，这说明尽管你听到许多关于知识是多么美妙的大话，但是直觉的准确性可要比知识高多了。吉姆也这么说。</td>
		<td class="en">Now there’s the facts, just as they happened: let everybody explain it their own way.I’ve ciphered over it a good deal, and it’s my opinion that some of it is knowledge but the main bulk of it is instink.The reason is this: Tom put the brick in his pocket to give to a museum with his name on it and the facts when he went home, and I slipped it out and put another brick considerable like it in its place, and he didn’t know the difference—but there was a difference, you see.I think that settles it—it’s mostly instink, not knowledge.Instink tells him where the exact PLACE is for the brick to be in, and so he reconnizes it by the place it’s in, not by the look of the brick.If it was knowledge, not instink, he would know the brick again by the look of it the next time he seen it—which he didn’t.So it shows that for all the brag you hear about knowledge being such a wonderful thing, instink is worth forty of it for real unerringness.Jim says the same.</td></tr>
