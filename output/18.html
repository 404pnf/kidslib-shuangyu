		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >瓦莱尔怎么了，亲爱的埃莉斯？你真心地与我许诺终生后，怎会这样忧伤？在我快乐的时候，你却在唉声叹气！你难道后悔让我感到幸福？还是后悔我逼得你答应我的求婚？</td>
		<td class="en">Val.What, dear Élise! you grow sad after having given me such dear tokens of your love; and I see you sigh in the midst of my joy!Can you regret having made me happy? and do you repent of the engagement which my love has forced from you?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃莉斯不，瓦莱尔，我不后悔我为你做的一切，有一股十分愉快的力量促使我这样做，我甚至不希望这件事还有别的可能性。可是，说实话，这事情的结果令我担忧，而且我害怕我爱你爱得有点过分。</td>
		<td class="en">Eli.No, Valère, I do not regret what I do for you; I feel carried on by too delightful a power, and I do not even wish that things should be otherwise than they are. Yet, to tell you the truth, I am very anxious about the consequences; and I greatly fear that I love you more than I should.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >瓦莱尔你对我一片深情，这有什么好怕的？</td>
		<td class="en">Val.What can you possibly fear from the affection you have shown me?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃莉斯怕这一切——怕我父亲生气，怕家人指责，怕众人说三道四。尤其最让我害怕的，瓦莱尔，便是你变心！我怕当女孩子表达出她纯真的爱意后，你们男人会残酷又冷漠地回应她。</td>
		<td class="en">Eli.Everything; the anger of my father, the reproaches of my family, the censure of the world, and, above all, Valère, a change in your heart!I fear that cruel coldness with which your sex so often repays the too warm proofs of an innocent love.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >瓦莱尔啊！不要误解我，把我看作和别的男人一样。你怎样想我都行，埃莉斯，可我绝不会辜负你。我太爱你了，我对你的爱永不改变！</td>
		<td class="en">Val.Alas! do not wrong me thus; do not judge of me by others. Think me capable of everything, Élise, except of falling short of what I owe to you. I love you too much for that; and my love will be as lasting as my life!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃莉斯啊！瓦莱尔，每个男人都这么说，所有男人说的话都一样，而只有通过行动，才能看出他们的不同。</td>
		<td class="en">Eli. Ah!Valère, all men say the same thing; all men are alike in their words; their actions only show the difference that exists between them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >瓦莱尔那么你为何不等一等，让我用实际行动来表明我的心迹？不要让不恰当的担忧误导了你，认为我有罪。不要让过度敏感的猜忌毁掉了我看得比生命还要重的幸福。给我点时间，我会无数次地向你证明我真挚的情感。</td>
		<td class="en">Val.Then why not wait for actions, if by them alone you can judge of the truthfulness of my heart?Do not suffer your anxious fears to mislead you, and to wrong me. Do not let an unjust suspicion destroy the happiness which is to me dearer than life; but give me time to show you by a thousand proofs the sincerity of my affection.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃莉斯唉！每当这时，人们都很容易相信自己所爱的人。我信任你，瓦莱尔，我相信你的心不会欺骗我，你是真心爱我，并永远忠于我。幸福近在咫尺，我不再怀疑了。如果我难过，那只是担心我们的艰难处境，还有其他人的责难。</td>
		<td class="en">Eli.Alas! how easily do we allow ourselves to be persuaded by those we love. I believe you, Valère; I feel sure that your heart is utterly incapable of deceiving me, that your love is sincere, and that you will ever remain faithful to me.I will no longer doubt that happiness is near.If I grieve, it will only be over the difficulties of our position, and the possible censures of the world.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >瓦莱尔可干吗要担心这个？</td>
		<td class="en">Val.But why even this fear?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃莉斯哦，瓦莱尔！如果所有人都像我一样了解你的话，我就没什么好担心了。我为你所做的一切，都能在你身上找到充分的理由。我的心知道你所有的好，而且我怀揣感激，一定要和你在一起。我怎会忘记我们第一次见面时的危难情景？你冒着生命危险，勇敢地把我从急流中救出来。将我救出之后，你又给我无微不至的关怀。你那持久的、像烈火一般的爱情，绝不会因为时间或者困难而减弱！为了我，你不顾自己的亲人和祖国，放弃自己的真实身份，甘愿做我父亲的仆人！我怎能对你为我所做的一切无动于衷？难道这不足以证明我对你的承诺是正确的吗？然而，别人是不是也这样认为呢？我又如何肯定别人能够了解我的感情呢？</td>
		<td class="en">Eli.Oh, Valère! if everybody knew you as I do, I should not have much to fear.I find in you enough to justify all I do for you; my heart knows all your merit, and feels, moreover, bound to you by deep gratitude. How can I forget that horrible moment when we met for the first time?Your generous courage in risking your own life to save mine from the fury of the waves; your tender care afterwards; your constant attentions and your ardent love, which neither time nor difficulties can lessen!For me you neglect your parents and your country; you give up your own position in life to be a servant of my father!How can I resist the influence that all this has over me?Is it not enough to justify in my eyes my engagement to you?Yet, who knows if it will be enough to justify it in the eyes of others?and how can I feel sure that my motives will be understood?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >瓦莱尔你徒劳地寻找着我这样做的价值，可是我认为是我的真爱，才值得你去提起。你父亲的本质就足以让大家明白你的担忧是有道理的。因为他过于贪婪，对自己的子女也很疏远，所以发生了再奇怪的事情也不算过分。亲爱的埃莉斯，请原谅我，在你面前这样评论你的父亲，可是很不幸，你也知道的，一提起你的父亲，我实在说不出什么好听的话来。不过，倘若我能如愿以偿地找回我的父母，他们会很快接受我们的。我迫不及待地等待着他们的消息，假如还是杳无音信的话，我就要亲自去找。</td>
		<td class="en">Val.You try in vain to find merit in what I have done; it is by my love alone that I trust to deserve you. As for the scruples you feel, your father himself justifies you but too much before the world; and his avarice and the distant way in which he lives with his children might authorise stranger things still. Forgive me, my dear Élise, for speaking thus of your father before you; but you know that, unfortunately, on this subject no good can be said of him. However, if I can find my parents, as I fully hope I shall, they will soon be favourable to us.I am expecting news of them with great impatience; but if none comes I will go in search of them myself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃莉斯哦不！瓦莱尔，你不要走，求求你。你要想办法得到我父亲的欢心。</td>
		<td class="en">Eli.Oh no!Valère, do not leave me, I entreat you. Try rather to ingratiate yourself in my father’s favour.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >瓦莱尔你知道我有多么想得到你父亲的欢心，你也看到了我付出的努力。为了给他当仆人，我已经费尽了心机对他阿谀奉承。为了得到他的赏识，我要隐藏自己的真实情感，极力地装出赞同他、迎合他的样子。为了获取他的宠爱，我要扮演怎样一个角色，这些你都应该看到了。在这方面，我取得了惊人的进步，而且我总结出要讨好一个人，最好的办法就是让他觉得你和他有一样的嗜好，把他的话当至理名言，把他的缺点说成优点，为他所做的事情鼓掌称赞。用不着害怕吹捧过了头，最聪明的人遇上拙劣的赞美也会上当的。再荒诞、再可笑的话，只要奉承着说，他也会欣然接受。我深知，做这事真诚多少要打点折扣，但是在有求于人的时候，我们也只好去迎合他们了，因为只有这样才能达到我们的目的。这不能怪吹捧的人，要怪就得怪那些愿意受吹捧的人。</td>
		<td class="en">Val. You know how much I wish it, and you can see how I set about it. You know the skilful manoeuvres I have had to use in order to introduce myself into his service; under what a mask of sympathy and conformity of tastes I disguise my own feelings to please him; and what a part I play to acquire his affection. I succeed wonderfully well, and I feel that to obtain favour with men, there are no better means than to pretend to be of their way of thinking, to fall in with their maxims, to praise their defects, and to applaud all their doings. One need not fear to overdo it, for however gross the flattery, the most cunning are easily duped; there is nothing so impertinent or ridiculous which they will not believe, provided it be well seasoned with praise. Honesty suffers, I acknowledge; but when we have need of men, we may be allowed without blame to adapt ourselves to their mode of thought; and if we have no other hope of success but through such stratagem, it is not after all the fault of those who flatter, but the fault of those who wish to be flattered.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃莉斯那你为何不试着去获得我哥哥的支持，万一那女仆泄露了我们的秘密呢？</td>
		<td class="en">Eli.Why do you not try also to gain my brother’s goodwill, in case the servant should betray our secret?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >瓦莱尔我是怕同时应付两个人顾不过来。你父亲跟你哥哥的脾气相差甚远，让他们两个都喜欢我，恐怕很难。不过你可以找你哥哥，利用你们的手足之情，让他站在我们这边。他来了，我得走了。趁机跟他说一说，探探口风，看看我们到底能不能相信他。</td>
		<td class="en">Val.I am afraid I cannot humour them both. The temper of the father is so different from that of the son that it would be difficult to be the confidant of both at the same time. Rather try your brother yourself; make use of the love that exists between you to enlist him in our cause. I leave you, for I see him coming. Speak to him, sound him, and see how far we can trust him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃莉斯我非常害怕，我不知道有没有那个胆量把我们的秘密告诉他。</td>
		<td class="en">Eli. I greatly fear I shall never have the courage to speak to him of my secret.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二场——克莱昂特，埃莉斯。</td>
		<td class="en">SCENE II.——CLÉANTE, ÉLISE,</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >克莱昂特我的妹妹，见你一个人在这里真高兴。我迫不及待要告诉你一个秘密。</td>
		<td class="en">Cle. I am very glad to find you alone, sister. I longed to speak to you and to tell you a secret.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃莉斯我很乐意听你说，哥哥。你想要告诉我什么呢？</td>
		<td class="en">Eli.I am quite ready to hear you, brother. What is it you have to tell me?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >克莱昂特太多事情，妹妹，不过这都能概括成两个字——爱情。</td>
		<td class="en">Cle.Many things, sister, summed up in one word—love.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃莉斯你恋爱了？</td>
		<td class="en">Eli. You love?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >克莱昂特是的，我恋爱了。不过，在我说这事之前，我得说，我知道自己该听从父亲的，作儿子的也该服从他的意愿。所以，没得到我们父母的同意就私定终身，这是不对的。上天已经决定由他们来主持我们的终身大事，我们的一言一行就应该顺从他们的意愿。他们都是过来人，能做出不偏不倚的判断。因此，他们也不会被虚假的表面所蒙骗，能更好地判断什么对我们有益。那么，我们就更应该信任他们的生活阅历，而不是自己的盲目热情。人年轻时的疯狂冲动，常常使我们陷入危险的深渊。这些我都知道，我的妹妹，我这样一说，就省得你再费口舌了，因为我的爱已让我无法再听进任何话，我恳求你，就不要劝阻我了。</td>
		<td class="en">Cle. Yes, I love. But, before I say more, let me tell you that I know I depend on my father, and that the name of son subjects me to his will; that it would be wrong to engage ourselves without the consent of the authors of our being; that heaven has made them the masters of our affections, and that it is our duty not to dispose of ourselves but in accordance to their wish; that their judgment is not biassed by their being in love themselves; that they are, therefore, much more likely not to be deceived by appearances, and to judge better what is good for us; that we ought to trust their experience rather than the passion which blinds us; and that the rashness of youth often carries us to the very brink of dangerous abysses. I know all this, my sister, and I tell it you to spare you the trouble of saying it to me, for my love will not let me listen to anything, and I pray you to spare me your remonstrances.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃莉斯哥哥，那你和你的爱人订下婚约了？</td>
		<td class="en">Eli.Have you engaged yourself, brother, to her you love?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >克莱昂特还没有，不过我已决心要娶她。而且我再一次恳求你，不要再找什么理由来阻止我。</td>
		<td class="en">Cle. No, but I have determined to do so; and I beseech you once more not to bring forward any reason to dissuade me from it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃莉斯哥哥，难道我是这么不近情理的人吗？</td>
		<td class="en">Eli. Am I such a very strange person, brother?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >克莱昂特不，亲爱的妹妹。可是你没有恋爱过，你体会不到爱情给我们内心带来的甜蜜力量。而且我怕你的理智，怕你跟我说大道理。</td>
		<td class="en">Cle. No, dear sister; but you do not love. You know not the sweet power that love has upon our hearts; and I dread your wisdom.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃莉斯啊！哥哥，不要说我理智。这世上大部分人都很理智，可人一生中总有失去理智的时候。而且如果我告诉你我的心事，也许你会认为我还不如你理智呢。</td>
		<td class="en">Eli. Alas! my brother, let us not speak of my wisdom. There are very few people in this world who do not lack wisdom, were it only once in their lifetime; and if I opened my heart to you, perhaps you would think me less wise than you are yourself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >克莱昂特啊！但愿你的情感也和我一样……</td>
		<td class="en">Cle. Ah!would to heaven that your heart, like mine …</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃莉斯还是先说你的事吧。跟我说说，你的爱人是谁。</td>
		<td class="en">Eli. Let us speak of you first, and tell me whom it is you love.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >克莱昂特她是最近搬到我们家附近的一个年轻女孩，一个人见人爱的姑娘。我亲爱的妹妹，大自然不会再造出比她更可爱的人了。第一眼看到她，我就像是获得了重生。她叫玛丽安娜，和她温柔善良的母亲住在一起。她母亲常年有病在身，可这个美丽的女孩对她却满生怜爱之心。她精心地照料着母亲，疼爱她、安抚她。她的温柔都能触动到你的心灵。她不管做什么事，都不失迷人魅力。她的一举一动都透出一种不可思议的优雅，一股无可匹敌的柔情，一种招人喜爱的谦逊，一个……噢！我的妹妹，我真希望你能亲眼看到她。</td>
		<td class="en">Cle. A young girl who has lately come to live in our neighbourhood, and who seems made to inspire love in all those who behold her. Nature, my dear sister, has made nothing more lovely; and I felt another man the moment I saw her. Her name is Marianne, and she lives with a good, kind mother, who is almost always ill, and for whom the dear girl shows the greatest affection. She waits upon her, pities and comforts her with a tenderness that would touch you to the very soul. Whatever she undertakes is done in the most charming way; and in all her actions shine a wonderful grace, a most winning gentleness, an adorable modesty, a … ah! my sister, how I wish you had but seen her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃莉斯亲爱的哥哥，听了你的这一番描述，我仿佛已经看到了她。你对她的爱足以说明她是一个怎样的人。</td>
		<td class="en">Eli. I see many things in what you tell me, dear brother; and it is sufficient for me to know that you love her for me to understand what she is.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >克莱昂特在她们不知情的情况下，我已经发现她们家经济状况不好，尽管她们已经很节省了，可那仅有的财产很难应付日常的支出。试想一下，我的妹妹，能够改善所爱的人的生活条件，提供这个善良家庭的基本所需，这不也是一种幸福吗？然而，父亲的吝啬却剥夺了我获得这种幸福的权力，使我不能向我一生最爱的姑娘表达我的爱意，这对我来说是多么的痛苦啊。</td>
		<td class="en">Cle. I have discovered, without their knowing it, that they are not in very good circumstances, and that, although they live with the greatest care, they have barely enough to cover their expenses. Can you imagine, my sister, what happiness it must be to improve the condition of those we love; skilfully to bring about some relief to the modest wants of a virtuous family?And think what grief it is for me to find myself deprived of this great joy through the avarice of a father, and for it to be impossible for me to give any proof of my love to her who is all in all to me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃莉斯是的，我理解，亲爱的哥哥，这对你来说一定非常痛苦。</td>
		<td class="en">Eli. Yes, I understand, dear brother, what sorrow this must be to you.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >克莱昂特我的妹妹，这痛苦你根本无法想象。父亲让我们过度地节衣缩食，还有什么比这更残酷？我们就该忍受这样不公的贫穷吗？如果我们得到财富的时候，美好年华已不在，现在却要为自己的日常开支四处借债，而且我们都不得不向商人低三下四才能穿上这体面的衣服，那这样的财富对我们还有什么好处可言？简而言之，我找你说这事，就是希望你帮我去探探父亲的口风，看他对我这事有何想法。如果他执意反对，我就决定离家出走，带着我心爱的女孩去别处生活，享受上天赐予我们的财富。我正努力为这事四处筹钱。亲爱的妹妹，如果你的心事也和我相似，自己的意愿与父亲背道而驰，我们就一起离他而去，摆脱长久以来那种令人难以忍受的吝啬对我们的折磨。</td>
		<td class="en">Cle. It is greater, my sister, than you can believe. For is there anything more cruel than this mean economy to which we are subjected?this strange penury in which we are made to pine?What good will it do us to have a fortune if it only comes to us when we are not able to enjoy it; if now to provide for my daily maintenance I get into debt on every side; if both you and I are reduced daily to beg the help of tradespeople in order to have decent clothes to wear?In short, I wanted to speak to you that you might help me to sound my father concerning my present feelings; and if I find him opposed to them, I am determined to go and live elsewhere with this most charming girl, and to make the best of what Providence offers us. I am trying everywhere to raise money for this purpose; and if your circumstances, dear sister, are like mine, and our father opposes us, let us both leave him, and free ourselves from the tyranny in which his hateful avarice has for so long held us.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >埃莉斯的确如此，父亲的做法越来越让我们怀疑母亲的早逝，还有……</td>
		<td class="en">Eli. It is but too true that every day he gives us more and more reason to regret the death of our mother, and that …</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Har. Twelve thousand francs a year?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >弗罗辛娜是的！首先，她是在及其严格的节俭观念中长大的。她习惯了简单的食谱，只吃沙拉、牛奶、干酪和苹果，而且既不需要讲究的餐桌食具，也不需要任何食材丰富的肉汤，或者养颜护肤的大麦茶。简而言之，其他女人渴望的精致小吃她都不需要。这些东西得花费不少钱，算起来每年得用去三千法郎。另外，她只想要干净和朴素的衣服，她不喜欢华丽的衣裙，昂贵的珠宝，或者豪华的家具，这都是别的女人喜欢的，而这笔账算下来每年得花掉四千多法郎。最后一点，她最痛恨的事情就是赌博，这在现在的女人中可是不多见的。为何这么说，因为我认识的一个邻居，今年就在这里面栽进去至少两万法郎。这里我们就按照四分之一来计算。每年五千法郎的赌资，加上四千法郎的衣裙和珠宝，再加上三千法郎的食物，这不就是一万两千法郎吗？</td>
		<td class="en">Fro. Yes!To begin with, she has been nursed and brought up with the strictest notions of frugality. She is a girl accustomed to live upon salad, milk, cheese, and apples, and who consequently will require neither a well served up table, nor any rich broth, nor your everlasting peeled barley; none, in short, of all those delicacies that another woman would want.This is no small matter, and may well amount to three thousand francs yearly. Besides this, she only cares for simplicity and neatness; she will have none of those splendid dresses and rich jewels, none of that sumptuous furniture in which girls like her indulge so extravagantly; and this item is worth more than four thousand francs per annum. Lastly, she has the deepest aversion to gambling; and this is not very common nowadays among women. Why, I know of one in our neighbourhood who lost at least twenty thousand francs this year.But let us reckon only a fourth of that sum. Five thousand francs a year at play and four thousand in clothes and jewels make nine thousand; and three thousand francs which we count for food, does it not make your twelve thousand francs?</td></tr>

Learn that the captain of that ship, touched with compassion at my misfortune, loved me; that he had me brought up as his own son, and that the profession of arms has been my occupation ever since I was fit for it; that lately I heard that my father is not dead, as I thought he was; that, passing this way to go and find him out, an accident, arranged by heaven, brought to my sight the charming Élise; that the sight of her made me a slave to her beauty, and that the violence of my love and the harshness of her father made me take the resolution to come into his house disguised as a servant, and to send some one else to look after my parents.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Mar. Yes, my heart was touched as soon as you began to speak; and our mother, who will be delighted at seeing you, often told me of the misfortunes of our family. Heaven spared us also in that dreadful wreck; but our life was spared at the cost of our liberty, for my mother and myself were taken up by pirates from the wreck of our vessel. After ten years of slavery a lucky event gave us back to liberty, and we returned to Naples, where we found all our property sold, and could hear no news of our father. We embarked for Genoa, where my mother went to gather what remained of a family estate which had been much disputed. Leaving her unjust relatives, she came here, where she has lived but a weary life.</td></tr>

Yes, my daughter; yes, my son; I am Don Thomas d’Alburci, whom heaven saved from the waves, with all the money he had with him, and who, after sixteen years, believing you all dead, was preparing, after long journeys, to seek the consolations of a new family in marrying a gentle and virtuous woman.
