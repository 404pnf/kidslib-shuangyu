		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >樵夫家里很穷，仅靠着一把斧子为生，两头骡子驮着他砍下的木柴拉到邻镇上去卖。樵夫的工作十分辛苦，不论冬天还是夏天，他每天早上五点钟就要起床。</td>
		<td class="en">He was very poor, having only his axe to depend upon, and two mules to carry the wood he cut to the neighbouring town; but he worked hard, and was always out of bed by five o’clock, summer and winter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这种生活持续了二十年，尽管现在他的儿子们已经长大成人了，并且和他们的父亲一起去森林砍柴，但是所有的事情好像都在和他们作对，他们还是跟以前一样穷。</td>
		<td class="en">This went on for twenty years, and though his sons were now grown up, and went with their father to the forest, everything seemed to go against them, and they remained as poor as ever.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >最终樵夫失望了，自言自语地说：</td>
		<td class="en">In the end the wood-cutter lost heart, and said to himself:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“如果到最后连一个便士都不能多挣，那这种活儿还有什么好干的？</td>
		<td class="en">‘What is the good of working like this if I never am a penny the richer at the end?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我再也不想去森林里干活了！</td>
		<td class="en">I shall go to the forest no more!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果我躺着睡觉，不再去追逐命运女神，或许哪一天，命运女神会反过来找我。”</td>
		<td class="en">And perhaps, if I take to my bed, and do not run after Fortune, one day she may come to me.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >所以第二天早上，樵夫就没有起床，当六点的钟声敲响时，正在打扫屋子的妻子去看他出了什么事。</td>
		<td class="en">So the next morning he did not get up, and when six o’clock struck, his wife, who had been cleaning the house, went to see what was the matter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你生病了？”妻子很诧异地问道，惊奇地发现他还没穿好衣服，</td>
		<td class="en">‘Are you ill?’ she asked wonderingly, surprised at not finding him dressed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“公鸡都叫了好几遍。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对，我辛辛苦苦干一天活，却连一顿饭的钱都挣不够。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Yes; and when I have toiled all day I hardly earn enough to give us one meal.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我可怜的丈夫，可是我们又能做什么呢？”妻子说道，</td>
		<td class="en">‘But what can we do, my poor husband?’ said she.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这只是命运女神和我们开的玩笑，她还未曾光顾我们呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘It is just a trick of Fortune’s, who would never smile upon us.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“唉，我已经受够了命运女神的捉弄了，”樵夫喊道，</td>
		<td class="en">‘Well, I have had my fill of Fortune’s tricks,’ cried he.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“如果她需要我，她会来这儿找我的。</td>
		<td class="en">‘If she wants me she can find me here.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我已经受够了跟木头打交道了。”</td>

		<td class="en">Do you think Fortune will come to anybody who does not go after her?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >穿上衣服，套上骡子，开始干活儿吧。</td>
		<td class="en">Dress yourself, and saddle the mules, and begin your work.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >你知道家里已经没有面包了吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">Do you know that there is not a morsel of bread in the house?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我才不管有没有面包了，我不会去森林里的。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I don’t care if there isn’t, and I am not going to the forest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >你怎么说都没用，没什么能让我改变主意。”</td>
		<td class="en">It is no use your talking; nothing will make me change my mind.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >忧心的妻子祈求无果，樵夫坚持在床上躺着。最后妻子绝望了，继续干自己的活儿去了。</td>
		<td class="en">The distracted wife begged and implored in vain; her husband persisted in staying in bed, and at last, in despair, she left him and went back to her work.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >几个小时后，邻村的一个人过来敲门，当樵夫的妻子打开门后，那人说：“早上好，夫人。</td>
		<td class="en">An hour or two later a man from the nearest village knocked at her door, and when she opened it, he said to her: ‘Good-morning, mother.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我找了个活儿，我想知道你丈夫能不能把骡子借我用一下，还有他能不能帮我一起干？”</td>
		<td class="en">I have got a job to do, and I want to know if your husband will lend me your mules, as I see he is not using them, and can lend me a hand himself?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他在楼上，你最好亲自问问他。”樵夫的妻子答道。</td>
		<td class="en">‘He is upstairs; you had better ask him,’ answered the woman.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那人就上了楼，把他的话又重复了一遍。</td>
		<td class="en">And the man went up, and repeated his request.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“很抱歉，我的邻居，我发誓不离开床的，任何事情也不能让我违背誓言。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘I am sorry, neighbour, but I have sworn not to leave my bed, and nothing will make me break my vow.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，那么，可不可以把你的两头骡子借我用用？</td>
		<td class="en">‘Well, then, will you lend me your two mules?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我会付给你一些报酬的。”</td>
		<td class="en">I will pay you something for them.’</td></tr>

		<td class="en">‘Certainly, neighbour.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管牵去用吧，不必客气。”</td>
		<td class="en">Take them and welcome.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是邻居离开了房子，从牲口棚里牵出骡子，把两个口袋放在骡背上，然后把骡子赶到了一个他发现藏着宝贝的地里。</td>
		<td class="en">So the man left the house, and leading the mules from the stable, placed two sacks on their back, and drove them to a field where he had found a hidden treasure.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两支口袋都被他塞满了钱，尽管他清楚地知道这些钱都是属于国王的，但是他仍然悄悄地把钱往家里运，这时他看到沿路走来两个士兵。</td>
		<td class="en">He filled the sacks with the money, though he knew perfectly well that it belonged to the sultan, and was driving them quietly home again, when he saw two soldiers coming along the road.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他意识到，如果他被抓的话就要被判死刑，所以他逃回了森林。</td>
		<td class="en">Now the man was aware that if he was caught he would be condemned to death, so he fled back into the forest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那两头骡子自己沿路跑向了主人的马厩。</td>
		<td class="en">The mules, left to themselves, took the path that led to their master’s stable.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当两头骡子跑到门前时，樵夫的妻子正在从窗子里往外看，骡子背上的两支口袋很沉，几乎要把它们压垮了。</td>
		<td class="en">The wood-cutter’s wife was looking out of the window when the mules drew up before the door, so heavily laden that they almost sank under their burdens.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她赶紧喊还躺在床上的丈夫。</td>
		<td class="en">She lost no time in calling her husband, who was still lying in bed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“快点儿！快点儿！你赶紧起床。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Quick! quick! get up as fast as you can.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们的两头骡子回来啦，驮着的口袋里不知道装着什么东西，那两支口袋很重，可怜的牲畜几乎撑不住了。”</td>
		<td class="en">Our two mules have returned with sacks on their backs, so heavily laden with something or other that the poor beasts can hardly stand up.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“老婆，我已经告诉过你很多次了，我是不会起床的。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Wife, I have told you a dozen times already that I am not going to get up.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >你为什么就不能让我安静一会儿呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">Why can’t you leave me in peace?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >见丈夫不愿意帮忙，妻子拿了把大刀，把骡背上系口袋的绳子割断了。</td>
		<td class="en">As she found she could get no help from her husband the woman took a large knife and cut the cords which bound the sacks on to the animals’ backs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >袋子立刻掉在了地上，接着金币暴雨般地撒了一地，小院子如同太阳一般耀眼。</td>
		<td class="en">They fell at once to the ground, and out poured a rain of gold pieces, till the little court-yard shone like the sun.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“财宝！”樵夫妻子吃惊地说道，</td>
		<td class="en">‘A treasure!’ gasped the woman, as soon as she could speak from surprise.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“财宝！”</td>
		<td class="en">‘A treasure!’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她跑去找她的丈夫。</td>
		<td class="en"> And she ran off to tell her husband.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“起床！起床！”她喊道，</td>
		<td class="en">‘Get up! get up!’ she cried.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不去森林里，躺在床上等待命运女神，真的太对啦！命运女神终于来了！</td>
		<td class="en">‘You were quite right not to go to the forest, and to await Fortune in your bed; she has come at last!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们的骡子把世界上所有的金币都驮回来了，全部堆在院子里。</td>

		<td class="en">In an instant the wood-cutter was on his feet, and running to the court, where he paused dazzled by the glitter of the coins which lay around him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“瞧，老婆，我是对的，”樵夫最后说道，</td>
		<td class="en">‘You see, my dear wife, that I was right,’ he said at last.</td></tr>
