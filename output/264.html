		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >很久以前，有一个年轻人应征入伍。他很勇敢，在枪林弹雨中，总是冲在最前面。打仗的时候，他的日子还好过。但自从战争结束了，他便退伍了。上尉说随便他去哪里好了。他的双亲都已过世，从那时起便没了家。于是他就来到了哥哥们的家里，祈求他们能收留他，再次发生战争时他便离开。但是，他的哥哥们都是铁石心肠，说道：“我们收留你有什么用呢？你对我们毫无用处；去外面养活你自己吧。”年轻人除了枪，什么也没有。他把枪扛在肩上就去闯荡世界了。他来到了一个广阔的荒原上，那里只有几棵树围成一圈。他悲伤地坐在树下，思考着他的命运。“我没有钱，”他想，“我除了会打仗什么也不会做。他们现在达成和平协议，不再需要我了。我看我是要饿死了。”突然间，他听到一阵喘气声。他四处张望，看见一个陌生人站在他的面前。这个人身穿一件绿色外套，站得笔直，但是却有一双裂开的令人害怕的脚。“我已经知道你需要什么了。”那个人说，“你可以从我这里得到用不完的金钱和物品。但是我必须先要知道你是否有大无畏的精神，看看我的钱会不会白白浪费。”“士兵和害怕——这两样东西怎能放在一起？”他说，“你可以考验我。”“很好。”那人说，“你看看后面。”士兵回头，看见了一只大熊正咆哮着向他走来。“噢！”士兵大声喊道，“让我给你的鼻子抓抓痒吧，你一会儿就没有咆哮的心情了。”于是，士兵瞄准了熊，扣住扳机，打中了它的鼻子。那只熊立刻倒了下来，再也没有动过。“我看你还不错。”陌生人说道，“你确实很有魄力，但是你还要答应我另外一个条件才行。”“只要你不让我做对不起良心的事情就行。”士兵说，这时他已经清楚地知道这个陌生人是谁了，“否则，我是不会和你做任何交易的。”“那就看你的了。”绿衣人说，“在以后的七年里，你不可以洗脸，剪头发，剪胡子，剪指甲，也不可以颂读祷文。我会给你一件衣服和一件斗篷，在这七年里，你必须穿着它们。如果七年内你死了，那你便属于我；如果你能够活下来，那么你就会获得自由，而且很富有，一辈子也用不完这些财富。”现在士兵想到自己已然穷途末路了，况且曾在战斗中出生入死，于是士兵决定冒冒险，同意了这些提议。魔鬼脱下绿衣服递给士兵，说道：“穿上这件衣服，任何时候你把手放进口袋里，都会有花不完的钱。”然后他又把大熊皮撕下来说：”这张熊皮就是你的斗篷。你只能躺在这张熊皮上睡觉，千万不能睡在其他床上。看看你这个样子，就叫你熊皮人吧。”说完这些，魔鬼便消失了。</td>
		<td class="en">THERE was once a young fellow who enlisted as a soldier, conducted himself bravely, and was always the foremost when it rained bullets.So long as the war lasted, all went well, but when peace was made, he received his dismissal, and the captain said he might go where he liked.His parents were dead, and he had no longer a home, so he went to his brothers and begged them to take him in, and keep him until war broke out again.The brothers, however, were hard-hearted and said, “What can we do with thee?thou art of no use to us; go and make a living for thyself.”The soldier had nothing left but his gun; he took that on his shoulder, and went forth into the world.He came to a wide heath, on which nothing was to be seen but a circle of trees; under these he sat sorrowfully down, and began to think over his fate.“I have no money,” thought he, “I have learnt no trade but that of fighting, and now that they have made peace they don’t want me any longer; so I see beforehand that I shall have to starve.”All at once he heard a rustling, and when he looked round, a strange man stood before him, who wore a green coat and looked right stately, but had a hideous cloven foot.“I know already what thou art in need of,” said the man; “gold and possessions shall thou have, as much as thou canst make away with do what thou wilt, but first I must know if thou art fearless, that I may not bestow my money in vain.”“A soldier and fear—how can those two things go together?” he answered; “thou canst put me to the proof.”“Very well, then,” answered the man, “look behind thee.”The soldier turned round, and saw a large bear, which came growling towards him.“Oho!” cried the soldier, “I will tickle thy nose for thee, so that thou shalt soon lose thy fancy for growling,” and he aimed at the bear and shot it through the muzzle; it fell down and never stirred again.“I see quite well,” said the stranger, “that thou art not wanting in courage, but there is still another condition which thou wilt have to fulfil.”“If it does not endanger my salvation,” replied the soldier, who knew very well who was standing by him.“If it does, I’ll have nothing to do with it.”“Thou wilt look to that for thyself,” answered Greencoat; “thou shalt for the next seven years neither wash thyself, nor comb thy beard, nor thy hair, nor cut thy nails, nor say one paternoster.I will give thee a coat and a cloak, which during this time thou must wear.If thou diest during these seven years, thou art mine; if thou remainest alive, thou art free, and rich to boot, for all the rest of thy life.”The soldier thought of the great extremity in which he now found himself, and as he so often had gone to meet death, he resolved to risk it now also, and agreed to the terms.The Devil took off his green coat, gave it to the soldier, and said, “If thou hast this coat on thy back and puttest thy hand into the pocket, thou wilt always find it full of money.”Then he pulled the skin off the bear and said, “This shall be thy cloak, and thy bed also, for thereon shalt thou sleep, and in no other bed shalt thou lie, and because of this apparel shalt thou be called Bearskin.”After this the Devil vanished.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >士兵把衣服穿上，手伸进口袋里摸了摸，果然有很多钱。然后士兵披上了熊皮，重新回到人群中。他尽情享受，过着随心所欲的生活。第一年，人们还可以接受他的样子。但是第二年，他开始变得像怪物了。他的头发把脸全部遮住了，胡子又长又脏像一块粗糙的毡子，指甲太长让手变得像个爪子，满脸厚厚的污垢，撒上种子都可以种菜了。任何人看见他都会跑开。但是由于他到哪都会救济穷人，让他们祈祷他可以活上七年。况且他毫不吝啬，于是总能找到睡觉的地方。第四个年头，他来到一家旅馆，店主不愿招待他，甚至连马厩都不让他住，因为店主害怕他这个样子会吓坏那些马。但当熊皮人从口袋里拿出一大把达克特后，店主立刻改变了态度，在外屋给他找了间房子。熊皮人答应不会让别人看见他的，以免影响旅店的生意。</td>
		<td class="en">The soldier put the coat on, felt at once in the pocket, and found that the thing was really true.Then he put on the bearskin and went forth into the world, and enjoyed himself, refraining from nothing that did him good and his money harm.During the first year his appearance was passable, but during the second he began to look like a monster.His hair covered nearly the whole of his face, his beard was like a piece of coarse felt, his fingers had claws, and his face was so covered with dirt that if cress had been sown on it, it would have come up.Whosoever saw him, ran away, but as he everywhere gave the poor money to pray that he might not die during the seven years, and as he paid well for everything he still always found shelter.In the fourth year, he entered an inn where the landlord would not receive him, and would not even let him have a place in the stable, because he was afraid the horses would be scared.But as Bearskin thrust his hand into his pocket and pulled out a handful of ducats, the host let himself be persuaded and gave him a room in an outhouse.Bearskin was, however, obliged to promise not to let himself be seen, lest the inn should get a bad name.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >晚上，熊皮人一个人坐着，由衷地盼望七年能快快过去。正当这时，他听到了隔壁房间的恸哭声。熊皮人非常善良，于是打开房门，看见一个老人悲伤地哭泣着，还一边痛苦地扭着双手。熊皮人朝他那边挪去，但老人被吓得跳了起来，想要跑开。最后，老人意识到熊皮人会说人话，这才安静下来。熊皮人一直安慰着老人，过了许久老人才肯说出伤心的理由。原来，他的家产渐渐都用光了。他和他的女儿每天挨饿。现在他穷得连房租也交不起，眼看就要进监狱了。“这有什么好发愁的。”熊皮人说，“我有花不完的钱。”熊皮人把店主叫来，替老人付了钱。他还把一大笔金币放进了老人的口袋里。</td>
		<td class="en">As Bearskin was sitting alone in the evening, and wishing from the bottom of his heart that the seven years were over, he heard a loud lamenting in a neighboring room.He had a compassionate heart, so he opened the door, and saw an old man weeping bitterly, and wringing his hands.Bearskin went nearer, but the man sprang to his feet and tried to escape from him.At last when the man perceived that Bearskin’s voice was human he let himself be prevailed on, and by kind words bearskin succeeded so far that the old man revealed the cause of his grief.His property had dwindled away by degrees, he and his daughters would have to starve, and he was so poor that he could not pay the innkeeper, and was to be put in prison.“If that is your only trouble,” said Bearskin, “I have plenty of money.”He caused the innkeeper to be brought thither, paid him and put a purse full of gold into the poor old man’s pocket besides.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >老人看到熊皮人为自己排忧解难，不知道该怎样表达自己的感激之情。“跟我来吧。”老人说，“我的女儿们个个生得国色天香，你选一个作为妻子吧。她若是知道了你对我的恩情，绝不会拒绝你的。你的样子虽然有点怪，但是她会把你收拾得干干净净的。”熊皮人非常高兴，于是跟着老人去了。大女儿一见熊皮人，大吃一惊，尖叫着跑开了。二女儿倒是安静地站在那里，从头到脚打量着熊皮人，然而后来却说道：“我怎么能接受没人样的丈夫呢？以前曾有一个拔光了毛的熊冒充人类，然而比起这个怪物，我当然更喜欢它，最起码他还穿着骑士装，戴着白手套。如果他只是难看些，也许我还可以接受。”然而小女儿说：“亲爱的爸爸，他将你从困境中救出来，他一定是个心地善良的好人，既然你承诺让他同你的女儿结婚，你就不能食言。”遗憾的是，熊皮人的长发和尘土把他的脸遮盖住了。否则老人和小女儿便可以看到熊皮人听完这句话后的笑容。熊皮人从手上摘下了戒指，把它掰成两半，给了小女儿一半，自己留了一半。他在小女儿的那半上刻上了自己的名字，又把她的名字刻在了自己的那半上。熊皮人请求小女儿要好好珍藏。他说：“我需要三年的时间才能回来。如果到时没有来，那就说明我死了。向上帝祈祷能让我保住性命吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">When the old man saw himself set free from all his troubles he did not know how to be grateful enough.“Come with me,” said he to Bearskin; “my daughters are all miracles of beauty, choose one of them for thyself as a wife.When she hears what thou hast done for me, she will not refuse thee.Thou dost in truth look a little strange, but she will soon put thee to rights again.”This pleased Bearskin well, and he went.When the eldest saw him she was so terribly alarmed at his face that she screamed and ran away.The second stood still and looked at him from head to foot, but then she said, “How can I accept a husband who no longer has a human form?The shaven bear that once was here and passed itself off for a man pleased me far better, for at any rate it wore a hussar’s dress and white gloves.If it were nothing but ugliness, I might get used to that.”The youngest, however, said, “Dear father, that must be a good man to have helped you out of your trouble, so if you have promised him a bride for doing it, your promise must be kept.”It was a pity that Bearskin’s face was covered with dirt and with hair, for if not they might have seen how delighted he was when he heard these words.He took a ring from his finger, broke it in two, and gave her one half, the other he kept for himself.He wrote his name, however, on her half, and hers on his, and begged her to keep her piece carefully, and then he took his leave and said, “I must still wander about for three years, and if I do not return then, thou art free, for I shall be dead.But pray to God to preserve my life.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可怜的未婚妻穿着一身黑装，一想起她的未婚夫，便不禁落泪。而她的姐姐却只会讽刺挖苦她。“小心点。”大姐说，“当你把手伸给他，小心他伸过来的是熊掌。”“注意点！”二姐说，“熊喜欢吃甜食。如果他喜欢你，说明他是想吃掉你。““你要顺着他的意思。”大姐又说，“否则他会对你乱叫的。”二姐继续说：“但是婚礼一定很精彩，因为狗熊很会跳舞。”小女儿保持沉默，并不把她们的话放在心上。而熊皮人从一个地方游荡到另一个地方。无论到哪儿他都尽自己的最大努力去帮助贫穷的人，好让人们为他祈祷。</td>
		<td class="en">The poor betrothed bride dressed herself entirely in black, and when she thought of her future bridegroom, tears came into her eyes.Nothing but contempt and mockery fell to her lot from her sisters.“Take care,” said the eldest, “if thou givest him thy hand, he will strike his claws into it.”“Beware!” said the second.“Bears like sweet things, and if he takes a fancy to thee, he will eat thee up.”“Thou must always do as he likes,” began the elder again, “or else he will growl.”And the second continued, “But the wedding will be a merry one, for bears dance well.”The bride was silent, and did not let them vex her.Bearskin, however, travelled about the world from one place to another, did good where he was able, and gave generously to the poor that they might pray for him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >终于到了七年期限的最后一天，熊皮人又来到原先的荒野上，在一圈树下坐了下来。没过多久便起风了，魔鬼出现在熊皮人的面前，非常生气地看着他。然后他把熊皮人的旧衣服扔给了他，要回了自己那件绿衣服。“我们还没有了断呢，”熊皮人说，“你必须先把我弄干净。”虽然魔鬼不想做，但他不得不取水帮熊皮人把身子洗干净，还为他梳头发、剪指甲。之后，他看起来就像个英勇的士兵，而且比以前更加帅气了。</td>
		<td class="en">At length, as the last day of the seven years dawned, he went once more out on to the heath, and seated himself beneath the circle of trees.It was not long before the wind whistled, and the Devil stood before him and looked angrily at him; then he threw Bearskin his old coat, and asked for his own green one back.“We have not got so far as that yet,” answered Bearskin, “thou must first make me clean.”Whether the Devil liked it or not, he was forced to fetch water, and wash Bearskin, comb his hair, and cut his nails.After this, he looked like a brave soldier, and was much handsomer than he had ever been before.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从前有个人，他有一个女儿，名叫聪明的埃尔西。她长大后，她父亲说：“我们应该让她嫁人了。”“是啊，”她的母亲说，“要是有人来求婚就好了。”终于有一天，一个从远方来的叫汉斯的小伙子来向她求爱。但他要求，聪明的埃尔西必须真的有智慧。“哦，”埃尔西的父亲说，“她是非常机敏的。”她母亲说：“哦，她能看见风吹过街道，甚至能听到苍蝇咳嗽的声音。”</td>
		<td class="en">There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie.And when she had grown up her father said, “We will get her married.”“Yes,” said the mother; “if only any one would come who would have her.”At length a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans; but he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really wise.“Oh,” said the father, “she’s sharp enough;” and the mother said, “oh, she can see the wind coming up the street and hear the flies coughing.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好啊，”汉斯说，“但如果她不是真的聪明，我是不会娶她的。”他们坐在餐桌前吃晚饭时，母亲说：“埃尔西，去地下室取些啤酒来。”随后，聪明的埃尔西从墙上取下酒罐，去了地下室。一路上，她轻快地敲着酒桶的盖子，好打发时间。在地下室里，她给自己找了把椅子放在酒桶前。这样一来，她就不用弯腰了，不会伤到她的背，也不会给她自己带来任何意外的伤害。随后，她把酒罐放在自己面前，拧开塞子，开始装酒了。在啤酒流入时，她也没让自己的眼睛闲着，而是不停地看看墙这儿，看看墙那儿。不一会儿，她注意到泥瓦匠偶然放在那儿的鹤嘴斧，就在自己的正上方。</td>
		<td class="en">“Well,” said Hans, “if she is not really wise, I won’t have her.”When they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said, “Elsie, go into the cellar and fetch some beer.”Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher from the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she went, so that the time might not appear long.When she was below she fetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had no need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected injury.Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and while the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but looked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a pick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left there.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >聪明的埃尔西便哭了起来，她说：“如果我嫁给汉斯，并有了孩子，在他长大后，我们叫他到地下室来取啤酒，这斧子掉到他头上会让他丧命的。”她坐了下来，想到未来的不幸，便用尽全身的力气哭喊。楼上的那些人等着喝啤酒，聪明的埃尔西却迟迟不来。于是埃尔西的母亲吩咐女仆说：“你去地下室看看埃尔西在不在。”那个女仆去了地下室，发现埃尔西正坐在酒桶前大声地哭着。“埃尔西，你为什么哭呢？”女仆问道。“啊，”她答道，“难道我不该哭吗？如果我跟汉斯结婚了，我们有了孩子，然后他长大了，在他来这儿取啤酒时，上面的斧子可能会掉到他头上砸死他的。”女仆说：“我们的埃尔西多聪明啊！”随后便坐在埃尔西旁边，跟她一起为这不幸而放声大哭。过了一会儿，女仆还没回来。楼上的人急着要喝啤酒，于是埃尔西的父亲又安排一个男仆：“你去地下室看看埃尔西和那女仆在不在。”男仆下去，看到聪明的埃尔西和女仆坐在那儿一起哭泣。于是，他问道：“你们为什么哭呢？”“啊，”埃尔西说，“难道我不该哭吗？如果我跟汉斯结婚了，我们有了孩子，然后他长大了，在他来这儿取啤酒时，上面的斧子可能会掉到他头上砸死他的。”男仆说：“我们的埃尔西多聪明啊！”同样地，他坐在她旁边，也开始嚎啕大哭。楼上的人都在等着这个男仆，但他还是没回来。埃尔西的父亲对妻子说：“你去地下室看看埃尔西在不在！”她下去了，看到那三个人都在悲痛地哭泣着，就问他们为什么哭。埃尔西同样告诉了她，她未来的孩子长大后来地下室取啤酒时，会被掉下的斧子砸死。然后这位母亲也跟前面的仆人一样，说道：“我们的埃尔西多聪明啊！”便坐下来跟他们一起哭泣。埃尔西的父亲在楼上等了一小会儿，他的妻子还没回来。他更加渴了，自言自语道：“我必须亲自到地下室看看埃尔西在不在。”但是当他进入地下室时，看到他们坐在那儿一起哭泣，也知道了哭泣的原因是埃尔西的孩子。埃尔西总有一天会有孩子的，如果这个孩子碰巧坐在斧子下面取啤酒，斧子可能会掉下来砸死他（她）。她父亲也哭喊道：“啊，多聪明的埃尔西啊！”于是他也坐在那儿和他们一起哭了起来。楼上的新郎独自等了很长时间。因为没有一个人回来，他想：“他们一定都在下面等我呢，我也应该下去看看他们在干什么。”他下去时，五个人都坐在那儿可怜地痛哭哀号着，哭得一个比一个伤心。“发生了什么不幸的事？”他问道。“啊，亲爱的汉斯，”埃尔西说道，“如果我们结婚并有了个孩子，他长大后，我们可能会让他到这儿来取酒喝，放在上面的斧子可能会掉下来砸碎他的脑袋，所以，难道我们不该哭吗？”“好啦，”汉斯说，“不需要太聪明啦，能料理家务就好了，我会娶你的！”他抓着埃尔西的手带她到楼上，并娶她为妻。</td>
		<td class="en">Then Clever Elsie began to weep, and said, “If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.”Then she sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the misfortune which lay before her.Those upstairs waited for the drink, but Clever Elsie still did not come.Then the woman said to the servant, “Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.”The maid went and found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly.“Elsie, why weepest thou?” asked the maid.“Ah,” she answered, “have I not reason to weep?If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill him.”Then said the maid, “What a clever Elsie we have!” and sat down beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune.After a while, as the maid did not come back, those upstairs were thirsty for the beer, the man said to the boy, “Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie and the girl are.”The boy went down, and there sat Clever Elsie and the girl both weeping together.Then he asked, “Why are ye weeping?”“Ah,” said Elsie, “have I not reason to weep?If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.”Then said the boy, “What a clever Elsie we have!” and sat down by her, and likewise began to howl loudly.Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not return, the man said to the woman, “Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is!”The woman went down, and found all three in the midst of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down.Then said the mother likewise, “What a clever Elsie we have!” and sat down and wept with them.The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said, “I must go into the cellar myself and see where Elsie is.”But when he got into the cellar, and they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and that Elsie’s child was the cause, and that Elsie might perhaps bring one into the world some day, and that it might be killed by the pick-axe, if it should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very time when it fell down, he cried, “Oh, what a clever Elsie!” and sat down, and likewise wept with them.The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone for a long time; then as no one would come back he thought, “They must be waiting for me below; I too must go there and see what they are about.”When he got down, five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting quite piteously, each out-doing the other.“What misfortune has happened then?” he asked.“Ah, dear Hans,” said Elsie, “if we marry each other and have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw something to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might dash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to weep?”“Come,” said Hans, “more understanding than that is not needed for my household, as thou art such a clever Elsie, I will have thee,” and he seized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >婚后，过了一段时间，汉斯说：“老婆，我要出去工作赚钱；你去田里把小麦割了，我们就可以做面包了。”“好的，亲爱的汉斯，我会去割小麦的。”汉斯走后，她为自己做了些美味的肉汤，带着去了田里。到了田里后她对自己说：“我应该做什么呢？是该先割麦子，还是先喝肉汤呢？啊，我还是先喝肉汤吧。”于是她把一盆汤喝完了，心满意足后，她再一次问自己：“我应该做什么呢？是该先割麦子，还是先睡觉呢？还是先睡觉吧。”然后她就躺在麦丛里睡着了。汉斯回家后，很久都没见埃尔西回来，他便说道：“我的埃尔西多聪明啊，她是如此地勤劳，都不回来吃饭。”到了傍晚，埃尔西还是没有回家，于是汉斯就出去看她割了多少麦子，却发现她躺在麦丛里睡觉，一点麦子都没割。看到这些，汉斯急匆匆地回到家，取来一个带铃铛的捕鸟网挂在埃尔西周围，这时她还在睡。然后他跑回家，关上房门，坐在椅子上干活。过了很久，天已经完全黑了，聪明的埃尔西醒来了。她起身时周围叮当作响，她每走一步，那些铃铛都会响。她吓坏了，开始怀疑自己到底是不是聪明的埃尔西，说道：“这是我么，不是我么？”但她不知道这个问题的答案，又站在那儿疑惑了一阵子。最后，她想：“我要回家问问我到底还是不是自己，他们一定知道。”她跑到自己家门口，但门是锁着的，她又敲着窗子喊：“汉斯，埃尔西在屋里吗？”“在，”汉斯答道，“她在屋里。”这下，她被吓了一大跳，说道：“哦，天哪！那这就不是我。”她去敲其他家的门，但当人们听到铃铛的叮当声时，他们都不会开门，她哪儿也进不去。后来，她冲出了村庄，从此就再也没人见过她。</td>
		<td class="en">After Hans had had her some time, he said, “Wife, I am going out to work and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we may have some bread.”“Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.”After Hans had gone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field with her.When she came to the field she said to herself, “What shall I do; shall I shear first, or shall I eat first?Oh, I will eat first.”Then she emptied her basin of broth, and when she was fully satisfied, she once more said, “What shall I do?Shall I shear first, or shall I sleep first?I will sleep first.”Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.Hans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said he, “What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not even come home to eat.”As, however, she still stayed away, and it was evening, Hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she was lying among the corn asleep.Then Hans hastened home and brought a fowler’s net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she still went on sleeping.Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat down in his chair and worked.At length, when it was quite dark, Clever Elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about her, and the bells rang at each step which she took.Then she was alarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or not, and said, “Is it I, or is it not I?”But she knew not what answer to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought, “I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure to know.”She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then she knocked at the window and cried, “Hans, is Elsie within?”“Yes,” answered Hans, “she is within.”Hereupon she was terrified, and said, “Ah, heavens!Then it is not I,” and went to another door; but when the people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she could get in nowhere.Then she ran out of the village, and no one has seen her since.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">There was once on a time an old king who was ill, and thought to himself, “I am lying on what must be my death-bed.”Then said he, “ Tell Faithful John to come to me.”Faithful John was his favourite servant, and was so called, because he had for his whole life long been so true to him.When therefore he came beside the bed, the King said to him, “Most faithful John, I feel my end approaching, and have no anxiety except about my son.He is still of tender age, and cannot always know how to guide himself.If thou dost not promise me to teach him everything that he ought to know, and to be his foster-father, I cannot close my eyes in peace.”Then answered Faithful John, “I will not forsake him, and will serve him with fidelity, even if it should cost me my life.”On this, the old King said, “Now I die in comfort and peace.”Then he added, “After my death, thou shalt show him the whole castle: all the chambers, halls, and vaults, and all the treasures which lie therein, but the last chamber in the long gallery, in which is the picture of the princess of the Golden Dwelling, shalt thou not show.If he sees that picture, he will fall violently in love with her, and will drop down in a swoon, and go through great danger for her sake, therefore thou must preserve him from that.”And when Faithful John had once more given his promise to the old King about this, the King said no more, but laid his head on his pillow, and died.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">When the old King had been carried to his grave, Faithful John told the young King all that he had promised his father on his deathbed, and said, “This will I assuredly perform, and will be faithful to thee as I have been faithful to him, even if it should cost me my life.”When the mourning was over, Faithful John said to him, “It is now time that thou shouldst see thine inheritance.I will show thee thy father’s palace.”Then he took him about everywhere, up and down, and let him see all the riches, and the magnificent apartments, only there was one room which he did not open, that in which hung the dangerous picture.The picture was, however, so placed that when the door was opened you looked straight on it, and it was so admirably painted that it seemed to breathe and live, and there was nothing more charming or more beautiful in the whole world.The young King, however, plainly remarked that Faithful John always walked past this one door, and said, “Why dost thou never open this one for me?”“There is something within it,” he replied, “which would terrify thee.”But the King answered, “I have seen all the palace, and I will know what is in this room also,” and he went and tried to break open the door by force.Then Faithful John held him back and said, “I promised thy father before his death that thou shouldst not see that which is in this chamber, it might bring the greatest misfortune on thee and on me.”“Ah, no,” replied the young King, “if I do not go in, it will be my certain destruction.I should have no rest day or night until I had seen it with my own eyes.I shall not leave the place now until thou hast unlocked the door.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >忠心的约翰看到劝阻无济于事，他心情沉重，唉声叹气地从钥匙串里取出那把钥匙。约翰打开门，自己抢先一步走进去，以为走在国王前面可以挡住那幅画像，这样国王就看不到了。但是又有什么用呢？国王踮起脚尖，从约翰肩膀上方看了过去。那位少女的画像如此高贵，身上的金银珠宝熠熠放光，国王一看到画像，便一阵眩晕，栽倒在地上。忠心的约翰扶起国王，并把他抬到床上，难过地想：“不幸已经降临了，上帝啊，该怎么办才好呢？”约翰往国王头上浇酒，国王终于苏醒过来。国王说的第一句话就是：“啊，美丽的画像！那是谁的呀？”“那是金屋公主。”忠心的约翰回答道。国王继续说：“我太爱她了，就算所有的树叶都变成舌头，也无法表达我的爱。为了得到她，我会不惜牺牲生命。你是我忠心的约翰，你一定要帮我。”</td>
		<td class="en">Then Faithful John saw that there was no help for it now, and with a heavy heart and many sighs, sought out the key from the great bunch.When he had opened the door, he went in first, and thought by standing before him he could hide the portrait so that the King should not see it in front of him, but what availed that?The King stood on tip-toe and saw it over his shoulder.And when he saw the portrait of the maiden, which was so magnificent and shone with gold and precious stones, he fell fainting to the ground.Faithful John took him up, carried him to his bed, and sorrowfully thought, “The misfortune has befallen us, Lord God, what will be the end of it?”Then he strengthened him with wine, until he came to himself again.The first words the King said were, “Ah, the beautiful portrait!whose it it?”“That is the princess of the Golden Dwelling,” answered Faithful John.Then the King continued, “My love for her is so great, that if all the leaves on all the trees were tongues, they could not declare it.I will give my life to win her.Thou art my most Faithful John, thou must help me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这位忠心的仆人想了很久，不知该怎么办才好，要知道即使看一眼金屋公主都很困难。终于，他想到了个办法。他对国王说：“她所有的东西都是金子做的——桌子、椅子、盘子、茶杯、碗和家具。您的财产中有五吨金子，让王国的金匠将金子做成各式各样的器皿，各种小鸟、野兽和稀奇古怪的动物，也许公主会喜欢。然后我们带着它们前去拜访，试试运气。”</td>
		<td class="en">The faithful servant considered within himself for a long time how to set about the matter, for it was difficult even to obtain a sight of the King’s daughter.At length he thought of a way, and said to the King, “Everything which she has about her is of gold—tables, chairs, dishes, glasses, bowls, and household furniture.Among thy treasures are five tons of gold; let one of the goldsmiths of the Kingdom work these up into all manner of vessels and utensils, into all kinds of birds, wild beasts and strange animals, such as may please her, and we will go there with them and try our luck.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >国王下令找来全国所有的金匠，命令他们日夜不停地工作，直到打造出最精美华丽的物品。所有物品都装上船后，忠心的约翰换上了商人的衣服，国王也被迫照做，以免被别人认出来。然后他们横穿大海，不停地航行，直到抵达金屋公主居住的城市。</td>
		<td class="en">The King ordered all the goldsmiths to be brought to him, and they had to work night and day until at last the most splendid things were prepared.When everything was stowed on board a ship, Faithful John put on the dress of a merchant, and the King was forced to do the same in order to make himself quite unrecognizable.Then they sailed across the sea, and sailed on until they came to the town wherein dwelt the princess of the Golden Dwelling.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >忠心的约翰让国王留在船上，等他回来。“也许我能把金屋公主带来，”他说道，“因此您要确保一切准备就绪，吩咐他们摆好金器，整条船都要装饰好了。”然后约翰把各式各样的金器装在围裙里，上岸后直奔皇宫。他走进皇宫大院时，看见一个漂亮的姑娘正提着两个金篮子在井边打水。正当姑娘转身去提金光闪闪的水桶时，看见这位陌生人，于是问他是谁。他回答道：“我是商人。”然后打开围裙给她看。她惊呼道：“啊，好漂亮的金器！”她放下水桶，一个个仔细地瞧。然后这个姑娘说道：“一定要让公主看看，她很喜欢金器，一定会全部买下来的。”她拉着约翰上楼去，原来这位姑娘是位女仆。国王的女儿见到这些金器非常开心，她说：“做工这么精细漂亮，你的这些金器我全都要买下来。”忠心的约翰回答道：“我只是一位富商的仆人。我带着的这些金器简直没法跟主人船上的相比。船上那些全都是用金子打造而成的最漂亮、最宝贵的物品。”公主想要约翰把所有的东西都带过来，但是约翰说：“东西太多了，要好多天才能搬完，还需要许多房间来摆设，您家的房子放不下。”公主再也抑制不住内心的好奇和渴望，最后她说：“带我去船上吧，我想亲自去见见你家主人的宝贝。”</td>
		<td class="en">Faithful John bade the King stay behind on the ship, and wait for him.“Perhaps I shall bring the princess with me,” said he, “therefore see that everything is in order; have the golden vessels set out and the whole ship decorated.”Then he gathered together in his apron all kinds of gold things, went on shore and walked straight to the royal palace.When he entered the courtyard of the palace, a beautiful girl was standing there by the well with two golden buckets in her hand, drawing water with them.And when she was just turning round to carry away the sparkling water she saw the stranger, and asked who he was.So he answered, “I am a merchant,” and opened his apron, and let her look in.Then she cried, “Oh, what beautiful gold things!” and put her pails down and looked at the golden wares one after the other.Then said the girl, “The princess must see these, she has such great pleasure in golden things, that she will buy all you have.”She took him by the hand and led him upstairs, for she was the waiting-maid.When the King’s daughter saw the wares, she was quite delighted and said, “They are so beautifully worked, that I will buy them all of thee.”But Faithful John said, “I am only the servant of a rich merchant.The things I have here are not to be compared with those my master has in his ship.They are the most beautiful and valuable things that have ever been made in gold.”She wanted to have everything brought to her there, but he said, “There are so many of them that it would take a great many days to do that, and so many rooms would be required to exhibit them, that your house is not big enough.”Then her curiosity and longing were still more excited, until at last she said, “Conduct me to the ship, I will go there myself, and behold the treasures of thine master.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >听到公主这样说，忠心的约翰非常高兴，他领着公主来到船上。国王见到公主，发现她比画像还漂亮，心都要融化了。公主上船后，国王把她领进船里。忠心的约翰来到舵手身边，下令开船，他说：“扬起船帆，让船像空中的鸟儿一样飞起来。”国王则向公主逐个展示那些金器，还有金子做的野兽和稀奇的动物。好几个小时过去了，公主还在兴高采烈地欣赏各种金器，完全没有发现船在行驶。公主看完最后一个，便向商人道谢，想要回家。但是当她来到船边，却发现周围一片汪洋，已经离大陆很远了，船舶正鼓起风帆飞速前进。“啊，”公主惊讶地喊道，“我被骗了！我被带走了，还落到了一个商人的手里，我宁愿去死！”国王一把握住她的手，说：“我不是商人。我是一个国王，身份跟你一样高贵，我之所以设计骗你是因为我太爱你了，请原谅我。第一次看到你的画像，我就晕倒在地了。”金屋公主听到这些话，才放下心来，也渐渐对国王有了好感，答应嫁给他。</td>
		<td class="en">On this Faithful John was quite delighted, and led her to the ship, and when the King saw her, he perceived that her beauty was even greater than the picture had represented it to be, and thought no other than that his heart would burst in twain.Then she got into the ship, and the King led her within.Faithful John, however, remained behind with the pilot, and ordered the ship to be pushed off, saying, “Set all sail, till it fly like a bird in air.”Within, however, the King showed her the golden vessels, every one of them, also the wild beasts and strange animals.Many hours went by whilst she was seeing everything, and in her delight she did not observe that the ship was sailing away.After she had looked at the last, she thanked the merchant and wanted to go home, but when she came to the side of the ship, she saw that it was on the deep sea far from land, and hurrying onwards with all sail set.“Ah,” cried she in her alarm, “I am betrayed!I am carried away and have fallen into the power of a merchant—I would die rather!”The King, however, seized her hand, and said, “I am not a merchant.I am a king, and of no meaner origin than thou art, and if I have carried thee away with subtlety, that has come to pass because of my exceeding great love for thee.The first time that I looked on thy portrait, I fell fainting to the ground.”When the princess of the Golden Dwelling heard that, she was comforted, and her heart was inclined unto him, so that she willingly consented to be his wife.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，正当他们在海上行驶，意想不到的事情发生了。忠心的约翰坐在船头弹奏音乐，忽而看到天空中飞过来三只乌鸦。约翰懂得鸟语，他停下来听乌鸦在说什么。一只乌鸦说：“哦，他正带着金屋公主回家呢。”“是的，”第二只回答，“但是他尚未得到她。”第三只说：“可他已经得到了呀，他们在船上，她就坐在他的旁边。”然后第一只又开口了，喊着：“那又怎么样呢？他们上岸后，会有一匹栗色马奔向国王，他会骑上去，而他一旦骑上去，栗色马就会驮着他狂奔，一直飞到天上去，他便再也见不到他的公主了。”第二只说道：“难道就没有解救的办法吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">It so happened, however, while they were sailing onwards over the deep sea, that Faithful John, who was sitting on the fore part of the vessel, making music, saw three ravens in the air, which came flying towards them.On this he stopped playing and listened to what they were saying to each other, for that he well understood.One cried, “Oh, there he is carrying home the princess of the Golden Dwelling.”“Yes,” replied the second, “but he has not got her yet.”Said the third, “But he has got her, she is sitting beside him in the ship.”Then the first began again, and cried, “What good will that do him?When they reach land a chestnut horse will leap forward to meet him, and the prince will want to mount it, but if he does that, it will run away with him, and rise up into the air with him, and he will never see his maiden more.”Spake the second, “But is there no escape?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，办法是有的。如果另外一个人迅速上马，并且从手枪皮套里掏出手枪，将马射死，年轻的国王便获救了。但是谁能知道呢？如果知道的人告诉了国王，他从脚趾到膝盖都会变成石头。”第二只说道：“我知道的比这多。即使杀死了栗色马，年轻的国王还是不能得到他的新娘。他们一起走进城堡后，会有一件礼服放在盘子上。那礼服看起来像用金丝银丝编织的，但却是硫磺和沥青做成的，如果国王穿上婚礼服，便会被烧得只剩骨头。”第三只说道：“难道没有解救的办法吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, yes, if any one else gets on it swiftly, and takes out the pistol which must be in its holster, and shoots the horse dead with it, the young King is saved.But who knows that?And whosoever does know it, and tells it to him, will be turned to stone from the toe to the knee.”Then said the second, “I know more than that; even if the horse be killed, the young King will still not keep his bride.When they go into the castle together, a wrought bridal garment will be lying there in a dish, and looking as if it were woven of gold and silver; it is, however, nothing but sulphur and pitch, and if he put it on, it will burn him to the very bone and marrow.”Said the third, “Is there no escape at all?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，办法是有的，”第二只回答道，“如果有人带着手套，抢先拿到礼服，把它扔进火里烧掉，年轻的国王就能得救了。但是这又有什么用呢？要是知道的人告诉了国王，他从膝盖到心脏的大半个身子就会变成石头。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, yes,” replied the second, “if any one with gloves on seizes the garment and throws it into the fire and burns it, the young King will be saved.“But what avails that?”Whosoever knows it and tells it to him, half his body will become stone from the knee to the heart.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后第三只说道：“我知道的比这还多，即使烧掉了婚礼服，年轻的国王还是娶不到公主。婚礼过后舞会开始，年轻的王后在跳舞时会突然面色发白，昏倒在地，就像死了一样，如果有人抬起她，在她的右胸部吸三滴血，然后吐掉，她便不会死。如果知道的人透露出去，他便从头到脚都会变成石头。”乌鸦说完后便继续向前飞，忠心的约翰明白了一切。但从那刻起他变得沉默起来，伤心不已，因为如果他对国王隐瞒一切，那国王便要遭遇不幸，如果他告诉了国王，自己就必须付出生命。最后，约翰告诉自己：“就算豁出性命，我也要解救主人。”</td>
		<td class="en">Then said the third, “I know still more; even if the bridal garment be burnt, the young King will still not have his bride.After the wedding, when the dancing begins and the young queen is dancing, she will suddenly turn pale and fall down as if dead, and if some one does not lift her up and draw three drops of blood from her right breast and spit them out again, she will die.But if any one who knows that were to declare it, he would become stone from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot.”When the ravens had spoken of this together, they flew onwards, and Faithful John had well understood everything, but from that time forth he became quiet and sad, for if he concealed what he had heard from his master, the latter would be unfortunate, and if he discovered it to him, he himself must sacrifice his life.At length, however, he said to himself, “I will save my master, even if it bring destruction on myself.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们上岸后，一切正如乌鸦所预测的那样，一匹高大的栗色马奔向前来。“很好，”国王说道，“他将会带我回皇宫。”正当他要骑上去，忠心的约翰抢到前面，飞快跳上去，从手枪皮套中拔出手枪，把马杀死了。其他不喜欢约翰的仆人嚷道：“约翰居然杀死这么漂亮的动物，多可耻啊，这匹马可是要带国王回宫的。”国王说道：“别吵了，随他去吧，他是我最忠心的约翰，他这么做一定是为我好！”他们进了皇宫，大厅里有个盘子，上面放着婚礼服，像是用金银丝编织而成的。年轻的国王走上前去，正要拿起来，可忠心的约翰却把他推开，戴上手套，一把抓起礼服，赶忙扔进火里烧掉了。其他一些仆人又开始窃窃私语：“看吧，现在他竟然连国王的婚礼服都烧了！”年轻的国王说道：“他这么做肯定有他的理由，你们哪里知道。随他去吧，他是我最忠心的约翰。”</td>
		<td class="en">When therefore they came to shore, all happened as had been foretold by the ravens, and a magnificent chestnut horse sprang forward.“Good,” said the King, “he shall carry me to my palace,” and was about to mount it when Faithful John got before him, jumped quickly on it, drew the pistol out of the holster, and shot the horse.Then the other attendants of the King, who after all were not very fond of Faithful John, cried, “How shameful to kill the beautiful animal, that was to have carried the King to his palace.”But the King said, “Hold your peace and leave him alone, he is my most faithful John, who knows what may be the good of that!”They went into the palace, and in the hall there stood a dish, and therein lay the bridal garment looking no otherwise than as if it were made of gold and silver.The young King went towards it and was about to take hold of it, but Faithful John pushed him away, seized it with gloves on, carried it quickly to the fire and burnt it.The other attendants again began to murmur, and said, “Behold, now he is even burning the King’s bridal garment!”But the young King said, “Who knows what good he may have done, leave him alone, he is my most faithful John.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Master Pfriem was a short, thin, but lively man, who never rested a moment.His face, of which his turned-up nose was the only prominent feature, was marked with small-pox and pale as death, his hair was gray and shaggy, his eyes small, but they glanced perpetually about on all sides.He saw everything, criticised everything, knew everything best, and was always in the right.When he went into the streets, he moved his arms about as if he were rowing; and once he struck the pail of a girl, who was carrying water, so high in the air that he himself was wetted all over by it.“Stupid thing,” cried he to her, while he was shaking himself, “couldst thou not see that I was coming behind thee?”By trade he was a shoemaker, and when he worked he pulled his thread out with such force that he drove his fist into every one who did not keep far enough off.No apprentice stayed more than a month with him, for he had always some fault to find with the very best work.At one time it was that the stitches were not even, at another that one shoe was too long, or one heel higher than the other, or the leather not cut large enough.“Wait,” said he to his apprentice, “I will soon show thee how we make skins soft,” and he brought a strap and gave him a couple of strokes across the back.He called them all sluggards.He himself did not turn much work out of his hands, for he never sat still for a quarter of an hour.If his wife got up very early in the morning and lighted the fire, he jumped out of bed, and ran bare-footed into the kitchen, crying, “Wilt thou burn my house down for me?That is a fire one could roast an ox by!Does wood cost nothing?”If the servants were standing by their wash-tubs and laughing, and telling each other all they knew, he scolded them, and said, “There stand the geese cackling, and forgetting their work, to gossip!And why fresh soap?Disgraceful extravagance and shameful idleness into the bargain!They want to save their hands, and not rub the things properly!”And out he would run and knock a pail full of soap and water over, so that the whole kitchen was flooded.Someone was building a new house, so he hurried to the window to look on.“There, they are using that red sand-stone again that never dries!” cried he.“No one will ever be healthy in that house!and just look how badly the fellows are laying the stones!Besides, the mortar is good for nothing!It ought to have gravel in it, not sand.I shall live to see that house tumble down on the people who are in it.”He sat down, put a couple of stitches in, and then jumped up again, unfastened his leather-apron, and cried, “I will just go out, and appeal to those men’s consciences.”He stumbled on the carpenters.“What’s this?” cried he, “you are not working by the line!Do you expect the beams to be straight?—one wrong will put all wrong.”He snatched an axe out of a carpenter’s hand and wanted to show him how he ought to cut; but as a cart loaded with clay came by, he threw the axe away, and hastened to the peasant who was walking by the side of it: “You are not in your right mind,” said he, “who yokes young horses to a heavily-laden cart?The poor beasts will die on the spot.”The peasant did not give him an answer, and Pfriem in a rage ran back into his workshop.When he was setting himself to work again, the apprentice reached him a shoe.“Well, what’s that again?” screamed he, “Haven’t I told you you ought not to cut shoes so broad?Who would buy a shoe like this, which is hardly anything else but a sole?I insist on my orders being followed exactly.”“Master,” answered the apprentice, “you may easily be quite right about the shoe being a bad one, but it is the one which you yourself cut out, and yourself set to work at.When you jumped up a while since, you knocked it off the table, and I have only just picked it up.An angel from heaven, however, would never make you believe that.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">One night Master Pfriem dreamed he was dead, and on his way to heaven.When he got there, he knocked loudly at the door.“I wonder,” said he to himself, “that they have no knocker on the door,—one knocks one’s knuckles sore.”The apostle Peter opened the door, and wanted to see who demanded admission so noisily.“Ah, it’s you, Master Pfriem;” said he, “well, I’ll let you in, but I warn you that you must give up that habit of yours, and find fault with nothing you see in heaven, or you may fare ill.”“You might have spared your warning,” answered Pfriem.“I know already what is seemly, and here, God be thanked, everything is perfect, and there is nothing to blame as there is on earth.”So he went in, and walked up and down the wide expanses of heaven.He looked around him, to the left and to the right, but sometimes shook his head, or muttered something to himself.Then he saw two angels who were carrying away a beam.It was the beam which some one had had in his own eye whilst he was looking for the splinter in the eye of another.They did not, however, carry the beam lengthways, but obliquely.“Did any one ever see such a piece of stupidity?” thought Master Pfriem; but he said nothing, and seemed satisfied with it.“It comes to the same thing after all, whichever way they carry the beam, straight or crooked, if they only get along with it, and truly I do not see them knock against anything.”Soon after this he saw two angels who were drawing water out of a well into a bucket, but at the same time he observed that the bucket was full of holes, and that the water was running out of it on every side.They were watering the earth with rain.“Hang it,” he exclaimed; but happily recollected himself, and thought, “Perhaps it is only a pastime.If it is an amusement, then it seems they can do useless things of this kind even here in heaven, where people, as I have already noticed, do nothing but idle about.”He went farther and saw a cart which had stuck fast in a deep hole.“It’s no wonder,” said he to the man who stood by it; “who would load so unreasonably?what have you there?”“Good wishes,” replied the man, “I could not go along the right way with it, but still I have pushed it safely up here, and they won’t leave me sticking here.”In fact an angel did come and harnessed two horses to it.“That’s quite right,” thought Pfriem, “but two horses won’t get that cart out, it must at least have four to it.”Another angel came and brought two more horses; she did not, however, harness them in front of it, but behind.That was too much for Master Pfriem, “Clumsy creature,” he burst out with, “what are you doing there?Has any one ever since the world began seen a cart drawn in that way?But you, in your conceited arrogance, think that you know everything best.”He was going to say more, but one of the inhabitants of heaven seized him by the throat and pushed him forth with irresistible strength.Beneath the gateway Master Pfriem turned his head round to take one more look at the cart, and saw that it was being raised into the air by four winged horses.</td></tr>

so he stood still and said,“Flounder, flounder in the sea, Come, I pray thee, here to me;For my wife, good Ilsabil, Wills not as I’d have her will.”Then the Flounder came swimming to him and said, “Well what does she want, then?”“Ah,” said the man, “I did catch you, and my wife says I really ought to have wished for something.She does not like to live in a wretched hovel any longer.She would like to have a cottage.”“Go, then,” said the Flounder, “she has it already.”When the man went home, his wife was no longer in the hovel, but instead of it there stood a small cottage, and she was sitting on a bench before the door.Then she took him by the hand and said to him, “Just come inside, look, now isn’t this a great deal better?”So they went in, and there was a small porch, and a pretty little parlor and bedroom, and a kitchen and pantry, with the best of furniture, and fitted up with the most beautiful things made of tin and brass, whatsoever was wanted.And behind the cottage there was a small yard, with hens and ducks, and a little garden with flowers and fruit.“Look,” said the wife, “is not that nice!”“Yes,” said the husband, “and so we must always think it,—now we will live quite contented.”“We will think about that,” said the wife.With that they ate something and went to bed.Everything went well for a week or a fortnight, and then the woman said, “Hark you, husband, this cottage is far too small for us, and the garden and yard are little; the Flounder might just as well have given us a larger house.I should like to live in a great stone castle; go to the Flounder, and tell him to give us a castle.”“Ah, wife,” said the man, “the cottage is quite good enough; why should we live in a castle?”“What!” said the woman; “just go there, the Flounder can always do that.”“No, wife,” said the man, “the Flounder has just given us the cottage, I do not like to go back so soon, it might make him angry.”“Go,” said the woman, “he can do it quite easily, and will be glad to do it; just you go to him.”The man’s heart grew heavy, and he would not go.He said to himself, “It is not right,” and yet he went.And when he came to the sea the water was quite purple and dark-blue, and grey and thick, and no longer so green and yellow, but it was still quiet.And he stood there and said,“Flounder, flounder in the sea, Come, I pray thee, here to me;For my wife, good Ilsabil, Wills not as I’d have her will.”“Well, what does she want, then?” said the Flounder.“Alas,” said the man, half scared, “she wants to live in a great stone castle.”“Go to it, then, she is standing before the door,” said the Flounder.Then the man went away, intending to go home, but when he got there, he found a great stone palace, and his wife was just standing on the steps going in, and she took him by the hand and said, “Come in.”So he went in with her, and in the castle was a great hall paved with marble, and many servants, who flung wide the doors; And the walls were all bright with beautiful hangings, and in the rooms were chairs and tables of pure gold, and crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling, and all the rooms and bed-rooms had carpets, and food and wine of the very best were standing on all the tables, so that they nearly broke down beneath it.Behind the house, too, there was a great court-yard, with stables for horses and cows, and the very best of carriages; there was a magnificent large garden, too, with the most beautiful flowers and fruit-trees, and a park quite half a mile long, in which were stags, deer, and hares, and everything that could be desired.“Come,” said the woman, “isn’t that beautiful?”“Yes, indeed,” said the man, “now let it be; and we will live in this beautiful castle and be content.”“We will consider about that,” said the woman, “and sleep upon it;” thereupon they went to bed.Next morning the wife awoke first, and it was just daybreak, and from her bed she saw the beautiful country lying before her.Her husband was still stretching himself, so she poked him in the side with her elbow, and said, “Get up, husband, and just peep out of the window.Look you, couldn’t we be the King over all that land?Go to the Flounder, we will be the King.”“Ah, wife,” said the man, “why should we be King?I do not want to be King.”“Well,” said the wife, “if you won’t be King, I will; go to the Flounder, for I will be King.”“Ah, wife,” said the man, “why do you want to be King?I do not like to say that to him.”“Why not?” said the woman; “go to him this instant; I must be King!”So the man went, and was quite unhappy because his wife wished to be King.“It is not right; it is not right,” thought he.He did not wish to go, but yet he went.And when he came to the sea, it was quite dark-grey, and the water heaved up from below, and smelt putrid.Then he went and stood by it, and said,“Flounder, flounder in the sea, Come, I pray thee, here to me;For my wife, good Ilsabil, Wills not as I’d have her will”“Well, what does she want, then?” said the Flounder.“Alas,” said the man, “she wants to be King.”“Go to her; she is King already.”So the man went, and when he came to the palace, the castle had become much larger, and had a great tower and magnificent ornaments, and the sentinel was standing before the door, and there were numbers of soldiers with kettle-drums and trumpets.And when he went inside the house, everything was of real marble and gold, with velvet covers and great golden tassels.Then the doors of the hall were opened, and there was the court in all its splendour, and his wife was sitting on a high throne of gold and diamonds, with a great crown of gold on her head, and a sceptre of pure gold and jewels in her hand, and on both sides of her stood her maids-in-waiting in a row, each of them always one head shorter than the last.Then he went and stood before her, and said, “Ah, wife, and now you are King.”“Yes,” said the woman, “now I am King.”So he stood and looked at her, and when he had looked at her thus for some time, he said, “And now that you are King, let all else be, now we will wish for nothing more.”“Nay, husband,” said the woman, quite anxiously, “I find time pass very heavily, I can bear it no longer; go to the Flounder—I am King, but I must be Emperor, too.”“Alas, wife, why do you wish to be Emperor?”“Husband,” said she, “go to the Flounder.I will be Emperor.”“Alas, wife,” said the man, “he cannot make you Emperor; I may not say that to the fish.There is only one Emperor in the land.An Emperor the Flounder cannot make you!I assure you he cannot.”“What!” said the woman, “I am the King, and you are nothing but my husband; will you go this moment?go at once!If he can make a King he can make an emperor.I will be Emperor; go instantly.”So he was forced to go.As the man went, however, he was troubled in mind, and thought to himself, “It will not end well; it will not end well!Emperor is too shameless!The Flounder will at last be tired out.”With that he reached the sea, and the sea was quite black and thick, and began to boil up from below, so that it threw up bubbles, and such a sharp wind blew over it that it curdled, and the man was afraid.Then he went and stood by it, and said,“Flounder, flounder in the sea, Come, I pray thee, here to me;For my wife, good Ilsabil, Wills not as I’d have her will.”“Well, what does she want, then?” said the Flounder.“Alas, Flounder,” said he, “my wife wants to be Emperor.”“Go to her,” said the Flounder; “she is Emperor already.”So the man went, and when he got there the whole palace was made of polished marble with alabaster figures and golden ornaments, and soldiers were marching before the door blowing trumpets, and beating cymbals and drums; and in the house, barons, and counts, and dukes were going about as servants.Then they opened the doors to him, which were of pure gold.And when he entered, there sat his wife on a throne, which was made of one piece of gold, and was quite two miles high; and she wore a great golden crown that was three yards high, and set with diamonds and carbuncles, and in one hand she had the sceptre, and in the other the imperial orb; and on both sides of her stood the yeomen of the guard in two rows, each being smaller than the one before him, from the biggest giant, who was two miles high, to the very smallest dwarf, just as big as my little finger.And before it stood a number of princes and dukes.Then the man went and stood among them, and said, “Wife, are you Emperor now?”“Yes,” said she, “now I am Emperor.”Then he stood and looked at her well, and when he had looked at her thus for some time, he said, “Ah, wife, be content, now that you are Emperor.”“Husband,” said she, “why are you standing there?Now, I am Emperor, but I will be Pope too; go to the Flounder.”“Alas, wife,” said the man, “what will you not wish for?You cannot be Pope.There is but one in Christendom.He cannot make you Pope.”“Husband,” said she, “I will be Pope; go immediately, I must be Pope this very day.”“No, wife,” said the man, “I do not like to say that to him; that would not do, it is too much; the Flounder can’t make you Pope.”“Husband,” said she, “what nonsense!If he can make an emperor he can make a pope.Go to him directly.I am Emperor, and you are nothing but my husband; will you go at once?”Then he was afraid and went; but he was quite faint, and shivered and shook, and his knees and legs trembled.And a high wind blew over the land, and the clouds flew, and towards evening all grew dark, and the leaves fell from the trees, and the water rose and roared as if it were boiling, and splashed upon the shore.And in the distance he saw ships which were firing guns in their sore need, pitching and tossing on the waves.And yet in the midst of the sky there was still a small bit of blue, though on every side it was as red as in a heavy storm.So, full of despair, he went and stood in much fear and said,“Flounder, flounder in the sea, Come, I pray thee, here to me; For my wife, good Ilsabil, Wills not as I’d have her will.”“Well, what does she want, then?” said the Flounder.“Alas,” said the man, “she wants to be Pope.”“Go to her then,” said the Flounder; “she is Pope already.”So he went, and when he got there, he saw what seemed to be a large church surrounded by palaces.He pushed his way through the crowd.Inside, however, everything was lighted up with thousands and thousands of candles, and his wife was clad in gold, and she was sitting on a much higher throne, and had three great golden crowns on, and round about her there was much ecclesiastical splendour; and on both sides of her was a row of candles the largest of which was as tall as the very tallest tower, down to the very smallest kitchen candle, and all the emperors and kings were on their knees before her, kissing her shoe.“Wife,” said the man, and looked attentively at her, “are you now Pope?”“Yes,” said she, “I am Pope.”So he stood and looked at her, and it was just as if he was looking at the bright sun.When he had stood looking at her thus for a short time, he said, “Ah, wife, if you are Pope, do let well alone!”But she looked as stiff as a post, and did not move or show any signs of life.Then said he, “Wife, now that you are Pope, be satisfied, you cannot become anything greater now.”“I will consider about that,” said the woman.Thereupon they both went to bed, but she was not satisfied, and greediness let her have no sleep, for she was continually thinking what there was left for her to be.The man slept well and soundly, for he had run about a great deal during the day; but the woman could not fall asleep at all, and flung herself from one side to the other the whole night through, thinking always what more was left for her to be, but unable to call to mind anything else.At length the sun began to rise, and when the woman saw the red of dawn, she sat up in bed and looked at it.And when, through the window, she saw the sun thus rising, she said, “Cannot I, too, order the sun and moon to rise?”“Husband,” she said, poking him in the ribs with her elbows, “wake up!go to the Flounder, for I wish to be even as God is.”The man was still half asleep, but he was so horrified that he fell out of bed.He thought he must have heard amiss, and rubbed his eyes, and said, “Alas, wife, what are you saying?”“Husband,” said she, “if I can’t order the sun and moon to rise, and have to look on and see the sun and moon rising, I can’t bear it.I shall not know what it is to have another happy hour, unless I can make them rise myself.”Then she looked at him so terribly that a shudder ran over him, and said, “Go at once; I wish to be like unto God.”“Alas, wife,” said the man, falling on his knees before her, “the Flounder cannot do that; he can make an emperor and a pope; I beseech you, go on as you are, and be Pope.”Then she fell into a rage, and her hair flew wildly about her head, and she cried, “I will not endure this, I’ll not bear it any longer; wilt thou go?”Then he put on his trousers and ran away like a madman.But outside a great storm was raging, and blowing so hard that he could scarcely keep his feet; houses and trees toppled over, the mountains trembled, rocks rolled into the sea, the sky was pitch black, and it thundered and lightened, and the sea came in with black waves as high as church-towers and mountains, and all with crests of white foam at the top.Then he cried, but could not hear his own words,“Flounder, flounder in the sea, Come, I pray thee, here to me;For my wife, good Ilsabil, Wills not as I’d have her will.”“Well, what does she want, then?” said the Flounder.“Alas,” said he, “she wants to be like unto God.”“Go to her, and you will find her back again in the dirty hovel.”And there they are living still at this very time.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">When mid-day came, the King wished to call them to come to dinner, but they were nowhere to be found.He sought them everywhere in the palace and garden, but could not find them.Then he was much troubled, and made known to the whole land that whosoever brought his daughters back again should have one of them to wife.Hereupon so many young men went about the country in search, that there was no counting them, for every one loved the three children because they were so kind to all, and so fair of face.Three young huntsmen also went out, and when they had travelled about for eight days, they arrived at a great castle, in which were beautiful apartments, and in one room a table was laid on which were delicate dishes which were still so warm that they were smoking, but in the whole of the castle no human being was either to be seen or heard.They waited there for half a day, and the food still remained warm and smoking, and at length they were so hungry that they sat down and ate, and agreed with each other that they would stay and live in that castle, and that one of them, who should be chosen by casting lots, should remain in the house, and the two others seek the King’s daughters.They cast lots, and the lot fell on the eldest; so next day the two younger went out to seek, and the eldest had to stay home.At mid-day came a small, small mannikin and begged for a piece of bread, then the huntsman took the bread which he had found there, and cut a round off the loaf and was about to give it to him, but whilst he was giving it to the mannikin, the latter let it fall, and asked the huntsman to be so good as to give him that piece again.The huntsman was about to do so and stooped, on which the mannikin took a stick, seized him by the hair, and gave him a good beating.Next day, the second stayed at home, and he fared no better.When the two others returned in the evening, the eldest said, “Well, how have you got on?”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Oh, very badly,” said he, and then they lamented their misfortune together, but they said nothing about it to the youngest, for they did not like him at all, and always called him Stupid Hans, because he did not exactly belong to the forest.On the third day, the youngest stayed at home, and again the little mannikin came and begged for a piece of bread.When the youth gave it to him, the elf let it fall as before, and asked him to be so good as to give him that piece again.Then said Hans to the little mannikin, “What!canst thou not pick up that piece thyself?If thou wilt not take as much trouble as that for thy daily bread, thou dost not deserve to have it.”Then the mannikin grew very angry and said he was to do it, but the huntsman would not, and took my dear mannikin, and gave him a thorough beating.Then the mannikin screamed terribly, and cried, “Stop, stop, and let me go, and I will tell thee where the King’s daughters are.”When Hans heard that, he left off beating him and the mannikin told him that he was an earth mannikin, and that there were more than a thousand like him, and that if he would go with him he would show him where the King’s daughters were.Then he showed him a deep well, but there was no water in it.And the elf said that he knew well that the companions Hans had with him did not intend to deal honourably with him, therefore if he wished to deliver the King’s children, he must do it alone.The two other brothers would also be very glad to recover the King’s daughters, but they did not want to have any trouble or danger.Hans was therefore to take a large basket, and he must seat himself in it with his hanger and a bell, and be let down.Below were three rooms, and in each of them was a princess, with a many-headed dragon, whose heads she was to comb and trim, but he must cut them off.And having said all this, the elf vanished.When it was evening the two brothers came and asked how he had got on, and he said, “pretty well so far,” and that he had seen no one except at mid-day when a little mannikin had come and begged for a piece of bread, that he had given some to him, but that the mannikin had let it fall and had asked him to pick it up again; but as he did not choose to do that, the elf had begun to lose his temper, and that he had done what he ought not, and had given the elf a beating, on which he had told him where the King’s daughters were.Then the two were so angry at this that they grew green and yellow.Next morning they went to the well together, and drew lots who should first seat himself in the basket, and again the lot fell on the eldest, and he was to seat himself in it, and take the bell with him.Then he said, “If I ring, you must draw me up again immediately.”When he had gone down for a short distance, he rang, and they at once drew him up again.Then the second seated himself in the basket, but he did just the same as the first, and then it was the turn of the youngest, but he let himself be lowered quite to the bottom.When he had got out of the basket, he took his hanger, and went and stood outside the first door and listened, and heard the dragon snoring quite loudly.He opened the door slowly, and one of the princesses was sitting there, and had nine dragon’s heads lying upon her lap, and was combing them.Then he took his hanger and hewed at them, and the nine fell off.The princess sprang up, threw her arms round his neck, embraced and kissed him repeatedly, and took her stomacher, which was made of pure gold, and hung it round his neck.Then he went to the second princess, who had a dragon with five heads to comb, and delivered her also, and to the youngest, who had a dragon with four heads, he went likewise.And they all rejoiced, and embraced him and kissed him without stopping.Then he rang very loud, so that those above heard him, and he placed the princesses one after the other in the basket, and had them all drawn up, but when it came to his own turn he remembered the words of the elf, who had told him that his comrades did not mean well by him.So he took a great stone which was lying there, and placed it in the basket, and when it was about half way up, his false brothers above cut the rope, so that the basket with the stone fell to the ground, and they thought that he was dead, and ran away with the three princesses, making them promise to tell their father that it was they who had delivered them, and then they went to the King, and each demanded a princess in marriage.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从前有个农夫，赶着母牛到集市上卖，卖了七泰勒。农夫回家时经过一个池塘，很远就听到青蛙喊着：“八泰勒、八泰勒、八泰勒、八泰勒......”“嗯，”他自言自语地说，“它们的叫声既不好听又没道理，我卖了7泰勒，不是8泰勒。”他来到水边，大声对它们嚷：“你们这些愚蠢的家伙！你们真的不知道吗？我卖了七个泰勒，不是八个。”　然而，青蛙还是喊着：“八泰勒、八泰勒、八泰勒......”“那么，好吧，如果你们不相信，我数给你们看。”他从口袋里掏出钱，数起他的7泰勒来，他每次都是数出24个格罗申。青蛙不理睬他，仍然喊着：“八泰勒、八泰勒、八泰勒、八泰勒......”“什么，”农夫非常生气地叫道，“既然你们知道的比我更清楚，你们就自己数吧。”说着便把钱全扔进了水里。他一直站在水边，想要等着青蛙数完后把钱还给他，但是青蛙们却固执己见继续喊着：“八泰勒、八泰勒、八泰勒、八泰勒......”然而并没有把钱扔出来。农夫一直等啊等，无奈天色已晚，便不得不回家了。他狠狠地骂了青蛙一顿：“你们这些只会游泳的东西，笨脑子，凸眼睛，你们长着大嘴巴，发出刺耳的叫声，可是就是数不出7泰勒！你们认为我会一直站在这里等着你们数完么？”说完他就走了，但是青蛙们仍然在农夫身后喊着：“八泰勒、八泰勒、八泰勒、八泰勒......”农夫十分生气地回家去了。没过多久，他又买了一头母牛宰掉了，他算过，如果牛肉卖得好的话，他可以卖出相当于两头牛的价钱，而且还白赚一张牛皮。于是农夫带着牛肉进城去卖，这时一大群狗堵在城门前，为首的是只大猎狗，它围着肉又蹦又跳，嗅个不停，“汪、汪、汪”地叫着。农夫一见根本无法阻止，便对它说：“好，好。我完全理解你的意思，‘汪、汪、汪，’想吃肉吧，但是如果我给你的话我就亏大了。”然而，狗除了“汪、汪”之外什么都没回答。“那你能保证不会吃个精光，并为你的同伴们作保吗？”“汪、汪、汪。”猎狗叫道。“好，看你这么坚持，我就把肉留给你，我非常了解你，知道谁是你的主人，但是我要告诉你，我必须三天内拿到我的钱，否则你的麻烦就大了。你必须要把钱送到我手里。”于是，他把牛肉卸下来，然后往回走了。这群狗围上来，大声叫着：“汪、汪。”农夫远远地听着它们的叫声，自言自语道：“听，他们都想要吃肉呢，但是大猎狗会为我作证的。”三天过去了，农夫心想：“今晚钱就要进口袋了。”他非常高兴。但是，没有人来付钱。“现在没一个信得住的人了。”农夫终于失去了耐心，进城去找屠夫，要回他的钱。屠夫以为农夫在跟他开玩笑，但农夫说：“我没开玩笑，我要你还钱！难道三天前大猎狗没有把我宰的那头牛带给你吗？”屠夫生气了，一把抓起扫帚把他赶了出去。“等着瞧，”农夫说，“世界上还是有王法的！”于是他跑进皇宫要讨个公道。他被带去见国王，国王正和公主坐在一起，国王问他受到了什么伤害。“哎呀！”他说，“青蛙和狗拿走了我的东西，屠夫反而还用棍棒打我。”接着，他把发生的事情原原本本地讲述了一遍。国王的女儿听后哈哈大笑，国王对他说：“这件事上我没法给你公正，但是你可以娶我的女儿做妻子。她从来没有像刚才那样笑过，我许诺过要把她嫁给能让她笑的人。你应该感谢上帝给你这么好的运气！”“哎，”农夫说，“我是不会娶她的，我已经有妻子了，我感到一个妻子已经够烦人了，每当我回到家，那种感觉糟透了，就像是每个角落里都站着我妻子一样。”国王发火了，生气地说：“你这个乡巴佬。”“啊，国王，”农夫说，“除了牛肉，你还能期望从牛上得到什么呢？”“行了，”国王说，“你会得到其他奖赏。先回去吧，过三天再来，到时候我会赏你500泰勒。”农夫出皇宫后，士兵对他说：“你把国王的女儿逗笑了，所以你一定会得到好东西的。”“是的，我也是这么想的，”农夫说，“国王说要赏我500泰勒。”“你听着，”士兵说，“分给我点。你要那么多钱有什么用呢？”农夫说：“你既然说了，就给你200泰勒吧，再过三天，你跟国王说，让他赏赐给你。”一个站在旁边的犹太人听到了他们的谈话，追上农夫，拉住他的衣服，说：“啊，天哪！你真是个幸运儿！我想和你做笔交易，用小额的银币和你换。反正你要那么多泰勒也没用。”“犹太人，”农夫说，“300泰勒是你的了，现在立马把银币给我，三天后国王会把钱给你的。”犹太人见有利可图，非常高兴，他带来的格罗申都是些成色不好的，三个才顶两个。三天过去了，按照国王的命令，农夫前去拜见国王。“脱下他的衣服，”国王说，“赏给他500泰勒。”“哎！”农夫说，“它们不再属于我了。我把200泰勒给了士兵，并和犹太人交换了300泰勒。所以现在没有东西属于我了。”这时士兵和犹太人进来了，他们向国王索要从农夫那里得来的钱，却得到一顿鞭打。士兵还能挺得住，他知道鞭打的滋味，但犹太人悲伤地说：“哎呀，哎呀，这就是沉甸甸的泰勒吗？”国王情不自禁地笑起来，对农夫的怒气也烟消云散了，他说：“虽然尚未得到便失去了奖赏，但是我送你其他东西作为补偿。你去我的宝库吧，想拿多少钱就拿多少钱。”无需国王说第二遍，农夫就跑去金库了，见什么装什么，把大口袋塞得鼓鼓的。之后他便回到旅店去数钱。犹太人悄悄地跟着农夫，听见他喃喃地说：“国王这个无赖，他骗我，为什么不当面赏赐给我钱呢？那样我不就知道自己有多少钱了吗？我怎么知道放入我口袋里的是好的还是不好的？”“天呐！”犹太人心想，“这个人对我们的国王如此大不敬，我要跑去告诉国王，到时候我会得到奖赏，他也会受到惩罚。”国王听说农夫说自己坏话，十分恼怒，他命令犹太人去把冒犯者带来。犹太人跑到农夫那里说：“你马上去见国王，不用换衣服了。”“我懂得礼节，”农夫说，“我得先让人做一套新衣服。你觉得一个口袋里有很多钱的人能穿一身破旧衣服去见国王吗？”犹太人看出农夫不换衣服不会出门，他担心国王怒气消退后，自己便得不到奖赏，农夫也得不到惩罚，于是说：“出于纯洁的友情，我可以暂时借给你一件衣服。为了友情有什么不可以做的呢！”农夫非常满意，穿上犹太人的衣服和他一起去见国王了。国王因为从犹太人那里听到农夫对自己的污蔑，便对农夫大加呵斥。“天哪，”农夫说，“犹太人经常说谎，他嘴里没有一句真话！那个无赖还说我穿的是他的衣服。”“什么？”犹太人尖叫道，“难道那件衣服不是我的吗？你要见国王，我纯粹出于友情才把衣服借给你，难道不是这样吗？”国王听到这些，说：“犹太人肯定骗了我们其中一个，不是我就是农夫。”于是命令人再给他点厉害尝尝。农夫穿着好衣服，装着一口袋钱回家了，他自言自语道：“这真是一桩好买卖！”</td>
		<td class="en">There was once a peasant who had driven his cow to the fair, and sold her for seven thalers.On the way home he had to pass a pond, and already from afar he heard the frogs crying, “Aik, aik, aik, aik.”“Well,” said he to himself, “they are talking without rhyme or reason, it is seven that I have received, not eight.”When he got to the water, he cried to them, “Stupid animals that you are!Don’t you know better than that?It is seven thalers and not eight.”The frogs, however, stood to their, “aik aik, aik, aik.”“Come, then, if you won’t believe it, I can count it out to you.”And he took his money out of his pocket and counted out the seven thalers, always reckoning four and twenty groschen to a thaler.The frogs, however, paid no attention to his reckoning, but still cried, “aik, aik, aik, aik.”“What,” cried the peasant, quite angry, “since you are determined to know better than I, count it yourselves,” and threw all the money into the water to them.He stood still and wanted to wait until they were done and had brought him his own again, but the frogs maintained their opinion and cried continually, “aik, aik, aik, aik,” and besides that, did not throw the money out again.He still waited a long while until evening came on and he was forced to go home.Then he abused the frogs and cried, “You water-splashers, you thick-heads, you goggle-eyes, you have great mouths and can screech till you hurt one’s ears, but you cannot count seven thalers!Do you think I’m going to stand here till you get done?”And with that he went away, but the frogs still cried, “aik, aik, aik, aik,” after him till he went home quite angry.After a while he bought another cow, which he killed, and he made the calculation that if he sold the meat well he might gain as much as the two cows were worth, and have the skin into the bargain.When therefore he got to the town with the meat, a great troop of dogs were gathered together in front of the gate, with a large greyhound at the head of them, which jumped at the meat, snuffed at it, and barked, “Wow, wow, wow.”As there was no stopping him, the peasant said to him, “Yes, yes, I know quite well that thou art saying, ‘wow, wow, wow,’ because thou wantest some of the meat; but I should fare badly if I were to give it to thee.”The dog, however, answered nothing but “wow, wow.”“Wilt thou promise not to devour it all then, and wilt thou go bail for thy companions?”“Wow, wow, wow,” said the dog.“Well, if thou insistest on it, I will leave it for thee; I know thee well, and know who is thy master; but this I tell thee, I must have my money in three days or else it will go ill with thee; thou must just bring it out to me.”Thereupon he unloaded the meat and turned back again, the dogs fell upon it and loudly barked, “wow, wow.”The countryman, who heard them from afar, said to himself, “Hark, now they all want some, but the big one is responsible to me for it.”When three days had passed, the countryman thought, “Tonight my money will be in my pocket,” and was quite delighted.But no one would come and pay it.“There is no trusting any one now,” said he; and at last he lost patience, and went into the town to the butcher and demanded his money.The butcher thought it was a joke, but the peasant said, “Jesting apart, I will have my money!Did not the great dog bring you the whole of the slaughtered cow three days ago?”Then the butcher grew angry, snatched a broomstick and drove him out.“Wait a while,” said the peasant, “there is still some justice in the world!” and went to the royal palace and begged for an audience.He was led before the King, who sat there with his daughter, and asked him what injury he had suffered.“Alas!” said he, “the frogs and the dogs have taken from me what is mine, and the butcher has paid me for it with the stick,” and he related at full length all that had happened.Thereupon the King’s daughter began to laugh heartily, and the King said to him, “I cannot give you justice in this, but you shall have my daughter to wife for it,—in her whole life she has never yet laughed as she has just done at thee, and I have promised her to him who could make her laugh.Thou mayst thank God for thy good fortune!”“Oh,” answered the peasant, “I will not have her, I have a wife already, and she is one too many for me; when I go home, it is just as bad as if I had a wife standing in every corner.”Then the King grew angry, and said, “Thou art a boor.”“Ah, Lord King,” replied the peasant, “what can you expect from an ox, but beef?”“Stop,” answered the King, “thou shalt have another reward.Be off now, but come back in three days, and then thou shalt have five hundred counted out in full.”When the peasant went out by the gate, the sentry said, “Thou hast made the King’s daughter laugh, so thou wilt certainly receive something good.”“Yes, that is what I think,” answered the peasant; “five hundred are to be counted out to me.”“Hark thee,” said the soldier, “give me some of it.What canst thou do with all that money?”“As it is thou,” said the peasant, “thou shalt have two hundred; present thyself in three days’ time before the King, and let it be paid to thee.”A Jew, who was standing by and had heard the conversation, ran after the peasant, held him by the coat, and said, “Oh, wonder!what a luck-child thou art!I will change it for thee, I will change it for thee into small coins, what dost thou want with the great thalers?”“Jew,” said the countryman, “three hundred canst thou still have; give it to me at once in coin, in three days from this, thou wilt be paid for it by the King.”The Jew was delighted with the profit, and brought the sum in bad groschen, three of which were worth two good ones.After three days had passed, according to the King’s command, the peasant went before the King.“Pull his coat off,” said the latter, “and he shall have his five hundred.”“Ah!” said the peasant, “they no longer belong to me; I presented two hundred of them to the sentinel, and three hundred the Jew has changed for me, so by right nothing at all belongs to me.”In the meantime the soldier and the Jew entered and claimed what they had gained from the peasant, and they received the blows strictly counted out.The soldier bore it patiently and knew already how it tasted, but the Jew said sorrowfully, “Alas, alas, are these the heavy thalers?”The King could not help laughing at the peasant, and as all his anger was gone, he said, “As thou hast already lost thy reward before it fell to thy lot, I will give thee something in the place of it.Go into my treasure chamber and get some money for thyself, as much as thou wilt.”The peasant did not need to be told twice, and stuffed into his big pockets whatsoever would go in.Afterwards he went to an inn and counted out his money.The Jew had crept after him and heard how he muttered to himself, “That rogue of a King has cheated me after all, why could he not have given me the money himself, and then I should have known what I had?How can I tell now if what I have had the luck to put in my pockets is right or not?”“Good heavens!” said the Jew to himself, “that man is speaking disrespectfully of our lord the King, I will run and inform, and then I shall get a reward, and he will be punished as well.”When the King heard of the peasant’s words he fell into a passion, and commanded the Jew to go and bring the offender to him.The Jew ran to the peasant, “You are to go at once to the lord King in the very clothes you have on.”“I know what’s right better than that,” answered the peasant, “I shall have a new coat made first.Dost thou think that a man with so much money in his pocket is to go there in his ragged old coat?”The Jew, as he saw that the peasant would not stir without another coat, and as he feared that if the King’s anger cooled, he himself would lose his reward, and the peasant his punishment, said, “I will out of pure friendship lend thee a coat for the short time.What will people not do for love!”The peasant was contented with this, put the Jew’s coat on, and went off with him.The King reproached the countryman because of the evil speaking of which the Jew had informed him.“Ah,” said the peasant, “what a Jew says is always false—no true word ever comes out of his mouth!That rascal there is capable of maintaining that I have his coat on.”“What is that?” shrieked the Jew.“Is the coat not mine?Have I not lent it to thee out of pure friendship, in order that thou might appear before the lord King?”When the King heard that, he said, “The Jew has assuredly deceived one or the other of us, either myself or the peasant,” and again he ordered something to be counted out to him in hard thalers.The peasant, however, went home in the good coat, with the good money in his pocket, and said to himself, “This time I have hit it!”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从前有个王子，英勇无比，他不想继续呆在王宫里。于是心想：“我要去外面的世界闯荡闯荡，那里的生活也许不会这么没意思，我还可以开开眼界。”王子告别父母，出发了。他日日夜夜地前行，走哪条路对他来说都一样。有一天，王子来到一个巨人的屋子前，他太累了，便坐下来靠在门口休息。他东瞧瞧，西看看，发现院子里有巨人的玩具。那是好几个巨大的球，还有跟人一样高的九柱戏柱子。过了一会儿，他突发奇想，把九柱戏柱子竖起来，然后用滚球击打，看到九柱戏倒下，他高兴地叫喊起来，玩得不亦乐乎。巨人听到吵闹声，便把头伸到窗子外面，看到一个小矮人在玩他的九柱戏。“小矮人，”他喊道，“你为什么玩我的滚球？你哪来那么大的力气？”王子抬起头看到巨人，说道：“哦，你这个大笨蛋，难道你真的以为只有你有力气吗？我可是没有做不到的事。”巨人走下来，敬仰地看着王子玩球，说道：“人类的孩子，如果你真的有本事，就去给我摘一个生命树上的苹果吧。”“你要它干嘛？”王子问道。“不是我想要，”巨人说，“是我的未婚妻想要。我游遍了整个世界都没有发现这棵树。”“我很快就能找到的，”王子说，“没有什么能阻止我摘下苹果。”巨人说：“你想得太简单了！生命树生长在四周尽是铁栏杆的花园里，栏杆外面卧着很多野兽，一个挨一个，它们在那里看守着，谁都不让进。”“它们肯定会让我进去的。”王子说道。“是的，但即使你进得去，看到挂在树上的苹果，你仍然得不到它。它前面挂着一个环，想摘下苹果的人都必须把手穿过此环，到现在还没有人有运气能够做到。”“这好运肯定是我的了。”王子说道。随后他与巨人告别，越过大山，走过山谷，穿过平原和森林，最后终于来到了这个神奇的花园。花园周围卧着很多野兽，但是它们已经垂下脑袋睡着了。而且王子走到跟前时，它们还没醒，于是王子跨过它们的身躯，爬过栏杆，安全地进入了花园。生命树在花园正中间，枝杈间红色的苹果熠熠夺目。王子顺着树干爬到了顶端，当他正要伸手去摘苹果时，看到苹果前面挂着一个环，但是他毫不费力地把手从圆环中伸过去，摘到了苹果。圆环突然紧紧地扣在他的胳膊上，王子感到一股奇异的力量在血管中流动。他拿着苹果从树上下来后，并没跨过栏杆，而是一把抓住大门，只摇晃了一下，伴随着一声巨响，大门便开了。王子走了出去，刚才还躺在那里酣睡的狮子现在醒了，狮子既没发怒也不凶猛，它温顺地跟在王子身后，把王子当作它的主人。王子把承诺带给巨人的苹果送给他，说道：“看吧，我把它带来了，没费什么劲儿。”巨人见自己的愿望这么快就实现了，非常高兴。他赶忙前去找她的新娘，把她想要的苹果给了她。她是个漂亮又聪慧的姑娘，她看到巨人胳膊上没有圆环，说道：“除非我看到你胳膊上的圆环，否则我不会相信苹果是你摘下来的。”巨人说：“我现在就回家把它取来。”巨人心想，如果小矮子不同意，从他身上硬取下来也是很容易的。于是巨人向王子要圆环，却被王子拒绝了。“苹果在，圆环在，”巨人说道，“如果你不乖乖地给我，那我们就决战吧。”他俩抱成一团斗了很久，但巨人却没能占到上风，王子那神奇的圆环给了他强大的力量。巨人想到了一个计谋，他说：“我打得浑身发热，想必你也如此。我们去河里洗个澡，身子凉下来后我们再继续打。”王子不知这是巨人的诡计，便跟巨人来到河边，把胳膊上的圆环同衣服一起脱下来，随即跳进了河里。巨人立即一把夺过圆环飞奔而去，但是狮子看到巨人偷东西，便追了上去，从他手里抢回圆环，把它带给了主人。于是，巨人躲到橡树后，趁王子穿衣服时突袭他，把他的双眼挖了出来。现在悲痛的王子什么都看不见，不知所措地站在那里。巨人又回到王子身边，牵着他的手，扮作给他带路的人，把王子领到了悬崖上。巨人把王子独自留在那里，心想：“只要再跨两步，他便会跌落悬崖，一命呜呼了，到时我便能拿到圆环了。”但是忠心的狮子并未抛弃王子，它紧紧地扯着王子的衣服，一点点地又把他拽了回来。巨人过来想抢王子的圆环，却发现计策落空了。“我难道连这样的弱者也杀不死吗？”他气呼呼地自言自语道。他又抓住王子，从另一条路把他带到了悬崖上，但是狮子这次识破了他的阴谋，帮助主人脱离了危险。他们快到悬崖边时，巨人放开王子的手，想要把他一个人留在那儿，但狮子推了巨人一下，巨人便跌落悬崖，摔得粉身碎骨。忠诚的狮子再一次把主人从悬崖上拉了回来。狮子指引着王子来到一棵树下，树边流淌着一条清澈的小河。王子坐在那里，狮子卧下来，用爪子往王子脸上洒水。几滴水一流进王子的眼眶，王子立马恢复了部分视力，他看到一只小鸟从眼前飞过，撞到了树干上，小鸟受伤了。小鸟跌落进河里，扑腾了几下后又飞了起来，在林间一闪而过，好像又重新恢复了视力。王子看出这是上帝的旨意，他弯下腰在河中抹了几把脸。他起身时，眼睛又恢复了视力，而且比以前还清澈明亮。王子感谢了仁慈的上帝，便带着狮子四处游历。这次他又来到了一座被施了魔法的城堡前。一位身材姣好、容貌精致的姑娘站在门口，但她全身黑乎乎的。姑娘对王子说：“哎，你能消除我身上的魔法吗？”“我该怎么做呢？”王子问道。姑娘回答说：“你必须在这座被施了魔法的城堡大厅里住三个晚上，而且不能害怕。不管他们如何折磨你，如果你能一声不吭地忍受着，那我的魔法就消除了。他们不敢要你的命。”王子说道：“我不害怕，希望上帝能保佑我。”于是王子欢快地走进城堡，天黑了，他就坐在大厅里等待着。四周静悄悄的，然而，到了午夜，突然响起了巨大的吵闹声，很多小鬼从各个角落和墙洞里钻了出来。他们像没有看到王子一样，坐在大厅中央，生起火，赌了起来。其中一个魔鬼输了，说道：“不对劲儿，有个外人在这里，都是因为他我才会输。”“等着，你这藏在火炉后边的家伙，我来了。”另一个说道。吵闹声更大了，谁听了都会毛骨悚然。王子仍然静静地坐在那儿，他一点都不怕。最后魔鬼们从地面上一跃而起，扑在他身上。由于魔鬼太多，王子根本无从反抗。他们在地板上拖着王子，掐他、刺他、揍他、折磨他，但是王子依然一声不吭。破晓之前，魔鬼们消失了，王子精疲力尽，四肢几乎动弹不得。黎明时分，黑姑娘走了过来。她手里拿着一个装着生命之水的小瓶子，她用生命之水为王子洗了洗，王子的疼痛立马消失了，而且又充满了力量。她说：“你成功地坚持了一个晚上，但是还有两个晚上等着你呢。”她说完便走了，这时王子发现，她的双脚变白了。第二天晚上，魔鬼们又来嬉闹了。他们跳到王子身上揍他，比前一晚更加凶猛，弄得王子遍体鳞伤。但是王子一声不吭，魔鬼们只能无奈地离开了。破晓时分，姑娘又来了，又用生命之水治好了王子的伤。她离开时，王子欣喜地发现，她的指尖已经变白了。现在他只需再熬最后一晚，但这晚可是最不好熬的。魔鬼们又来了。“你还在吗？”他们喊道，“我们要折磨死你。”他们刺他、打他，把他扔来扔去，还撕扯他的胳膊和腿，好像要把他五马分尸一样，但是王子忍受着，没有发出一点声音。最后魔鬼们消失了，但王子却晕倒在地，一动不动，也没有力气看进来的姑娘一眼。姑娘又将生命之水洒在王子身上。疼痛立马消失了，王子像刚睡醒一般，活力四射，他睁开眼，看到姑娘站在自己身旁，皮肤雪白，像白昼一样美丽。“站起来，”她说，“在楼梯上舞动三下宝剑，所有的一切就都能得救了。”王子照做了，整个城堡都消除了诅咒，而那位姑娘正是一位富有国王的女儿。仆人走过来说，大厅里宴席已经准备好了，该用膳了。他们坐下来一起享受着盛宴。那天晚上，他们举行了一场欢快又隆重的婚礼。</td>
		<td class="en">There was once a King’s son, who was no longer content to stay at home in his father’s house, and as he had no fear of anything, he thought, “I will go forth into the wide world, there the time will not seem long to me, and I shall see wonders enough.”So he took leave of his parents, and went forth, and on and on from morning till night, and whichever way his path led it was the same to him.It came to pass that he got to the house of a giant, and as he was so tired he sat down by the door and rested.And as he let his eyes roam here and there, he saw the giant’s playthings lying in the yard.These were a couple of enormous balls, and nine-pins as tall as a man.After a while he had a fancy to set the nine-pins up and then rolled the balls at them, and screamed and cried out when the nine-pins fell, and had a merry time of it.The giant heard the noise, stretched his head out of the window, and saw a man who was not taller than other men, and yet played with his nine-pins.“Little worm,” cried he, “why art thou playing with my balls?Who gave thee strength to do it?”The King’s son looked up, saw the giant, and said, “Oh, thou blockhead, thou thinkest indeed that thou only hast strong arms, I can do everything I want to do.”The giant came down and watched the bowling with great admiration, and said, “Child of man, if thou art one of that kind, go and bring me an apple of the tree of life.”“What dost thou want with it?” said the King’s son.“I do not want the apple for myself,” answered the giant, “but I have a betrothed bride who wishes for it.I have travelled far about the world and cannot find the tree.”“I will soon find it,” said the King’s son, “and I do not know what is to prevent me from getting the apple down.”The giant said, “Thou really believest it to be so easy!The garden in which the tree stands is surrounded by an iron railing, and in front of the railing lie wild beasts, each close to the other, and they keep watch and let no man go in.”“They will be sure to let me in,” said the King’s son.“Yes, but even if thou dost get into the garden, and seest the apple hanging to the tree, it is still not thine; a ring hangs in front of it, through which any one who wants to reach the apple and break it off, must put his hand, and no one has yet had the luck to do it.”“That luck will be mine,” said the King’s son.Then he took leave of the giant, and went forth over mountain and valley, and through plains and forests, until at length he came to the wondrous garden.The beasts lay round about it, but they had put their heads down and were asleep.Moreover, they did not awake when he went up to them, so he stepped over them, climbed the fence, and got safely into the garden.There, in the very middle of it, stood the tree of life, and the red apples were shining upon the branches.He climbed up the trunk to the top, and as he was about to reach out for an apple, he saw a ring hanging before it; but he thrust his hand through that without any difficulty, and gathered the apple.The ring closed tightly on his arm, and all at once he felt a prodigious strength flowing through his veins.When he had come down again from the tree with the apple, he would not climb over the fence, but grasped the great gate, and had no need to shake it more than once before it sprang open with a loud crash.Then he went out, and the lion which had been lying down before, was awake and sprang after him, not in rage and fierceness, but following him humbly as its master.The King’s son took the giant the apple he had promised him, and said, “Seest thou, I have brought it without difficulty.”The giant was glad that his desire had been so soon satisfied, hastened to his bride, and gave her the apple for which she had wished.She was a beautiful and wise maiden, and as she did not see the ring on his arm, she said, “I shall never believe that thou hast brought the apple, until I see the ring on thine arm.”The giant said, “I have nothing to do but go home and fetch it,” and thought it would be easy to take away by force from the weak man, what he would not give of his own free will.He therefore demanded the ring from him, but the King’s son refused it.“Where the apple is, the ring must be also,” said the giant; “if thou wilt not give it of thine own accord, thou must fight with me for it.”They wrestled with each other for a long time, but the giant could not get the better of the King’s son, who was strengthened by the magical power of the ring.Then the giant thought of a stratagem, and said, “I have got warm with fighting, and so hast thou.We will bathe in the river, and cool ourselves before we begin again.”The King’s son, who knew nothing of falsehood, went with him to the water, and pulled off with his clothes the ring also from his arm, and sprang into the river.The giant instantly snatched the ring, and ran away with it, but the lion, which had observed the theft, pursued the giant, tore the ring out of his hand, and brought it back to its master.Then the giant placed himself behind an oak-tree, and while the King’s son was busy putting on his clothes again, surprised him, and put both his eyes out.And now the unhappy King’s son stood there, and was blind and knew not how to help himself.Then the giant came back to him, took him by the hand as if he were someone who wanted to guide him, and led him to the top of a high rock.There he left him standing, and thought, “Just two steps more, and he will fall down and kill himself, and I can take the ring from him.”But the faithful lion had not deserted its master; it held him fast by the clothes, and drew him gradually back again.When the giant came and wanted to rob the dead man, he saw that his cunning had been in vain.“Is there no way, then, of destroying a weak child of man like that?” said he angrily to himself, and seized the King’s son and led him back again to the precipice by another way, but the lion which saw his evil design, helped its master out of danger here also.When they had got close to the edge, the giant let the blind man’s hand drop, and was going to leave him behind alone, but the lion pushed the giant so that he was thrown down and fell, dashed to pieces, on the ground.The faithful animal again drew its master back from the precipice, and guided him to a tree by which flowed a clear brook.The King’s son sat down there, but the lion lay down, and sprinkled the water in his face with its paws.Scarcely had a couple of drops wetted the sockets of his eyes, than he was once more able to see something, and remarked a little bird flying quite close by, which wounded itself against the trunk of a tree.On this it went down to the water and bathed itself therein, and then it soared upwards and swept between the trees without touching them, as if it had recovered its sight again.Then the King’s son recognized a sign from God and stooped down to the water, and washed and bathed his face in it.And when he arose he had his eyes once more, brighter and clearer than they had ever been.The King’s son thanked God for his great mercy, and travelled with his lion onwards through the world.And it came to pass that he arrived before a castle which was enchanted.In the gateway stood a maiden of beautiful form and fine face, but she was quite black.She spoke to him and said, “Ah, if thou couldst but deliver me from the evil spell which is thrown over me.”“What shall I do?” said the King’s son.The maiden answered, “Thou must pass three nights in the great hall of this enchanted castle, but thou must let no fear enter thy heart.When they are doing their worst to torment thee, if thou bearest it without letting a sound escape thee, I shall be free.Thy life they dare not take.”Then said the King’s son, “I have no fear; with God’s help I will try it.”So he went gaily into the castle, and when it grew dark he seated himself in the large hall and waited.Everything was quiet, however, till midnight, when all at once a great tumult began, and out of every hole and corner came little devils.They behaved as if they did not see him, seated themselves in the middle of the room, lighted a fire, and began to gamble.When one of them lost, he said, “It is not right; some one is here who does not belong to us; it is his fault that I am losing.”“Wait, you fellow behind the stove, I am coming,” said another.The screaming became still louder, so that no one could have heard it without terror.The King’s son stayed sitting quite quietly, and was not afraid; but at last the devils jumped up from the ground, and fell on him, and there were so many of them that he could not defend himself from them.They dragged him about on the floor, pinched him, pricked him, beat him, and tormented him, but no sound escaped from him.Towards morning they disappeared, and he was so exhausted that he could scarcely move his limbs, but when day dawned the black maiden came to him.She bore in her hand a little bottle wherein was the water of life wherewith she washed him, and he at once felt all pain depart and new strength flow through his veins.She said, “Thou hast held out successfully for one night, but two more lie before thee.”Then she went away again, and as she was going, he observed that her feet had become white.The next night the devils came and began their gambols anew.They fell on the King’s son, and beat him much more severely than the night before, until his body was covered with wounds.But as he bore all quietly, they were forced to leave him, and when dawn appeared, the maiden came and healed him with the water of life.And when she went away, he saw with joy that she had already become white to the tips of her fingers.And now he had only one night more to go through, but it was the worst.The hob-goblins came again: “Art thou there still?” cried they, “thou shalt be tormented till thy breath stops.”They pricked him and beat him, and threw him here and there, and pulled him by the arms and legs as if they wanted to tear him to pieces, but he bore everything, and never uttered a cry.At last the devils vanished, but he lay fainting there, and did not stir, nor could he raise his eyes to look at the maiden who came in, and sprinkled and bathed him with the water of life.But suddenly he was freed from all pain, and felt fresh and healthy as if he had awakened from sleep, and when he opened his eyes he saw the maiden standing by him, snow-white, and fair as day.“Rise,” said she, “and swing thy sword three times over the stairs, and then all will be delivered.”And when he had done that, the whole castle was released from enchantment, and the maiden was a rich King’s daughter.The servants came and said that the table was already set in the great hall, and dinner served up.Then they sat down and ate and drank together, and in the evening the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicings.</td></tr>

but if thou art not awake, but sleeping, I shall not be set free.”The man promised to do everything that she desired, but the raven said, alas, “I know already that thou wilt not deliver me; thou wilt accept something from the woman.”Then the man once more promised that he would certainly not touch anything either to eat or to drink.But when he entered the house the old woman came to him and said, “Poor man, how faint you are; come and refresh yourself; eat and drink.”“No,” said the man, “I will not eat or drink.”She, however, let him have no peace, and said, “If you will not eat, take one drink out of the glass; one is nothing.”Then he let himself be persuaded, and drank.Shortly before two o’clock in the afternoon he went into the garden to the tan heap to wait for the raven.As he was standing there, his weariness all at once became so great that he could not struggle against it, and lay down for a short time, but he was determined not to go to sleep.Hardly, however, had he lain down, than his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell asleep and slept so soundly that nothing in the world could have aroused him.At two o’clock the raven came driving up with four white horses, but she was already in deep grief and said, “I know he is asleep.”And when she came into the garden, he was indeed lying there asleep on the heap of tan.She alighted from the carriage, went to him, shook him, and called him, but he did not awake.Next day about noon, the old woman came again and brought him food and drink, but he would not take any of it.But she let him have no rest and persuaded him until at length he again took one drink out of the glass.Towards two o’clock he went into the garden to the tan heap to wait for the raven, but all at once felt such a great weariness that his limbs would no longer support him.He could not help himself, and was forced to lie down, and fell into a heavy sleep.When the raven drove up with four brown horses, she was already full of grief, and said, “I know he is asleep.”She went to him, but there he lay sleeping, and there was no wakening him.Next day the old woman asked what was the meaning of this?He was neither eating nor drinking anything; did he want to die?He replied, “I am not allowed to eat or drink, and will not do so.”But she set a dish with food, and a glass with wine before him, and when he smelt it he could not resist, and swallowed a deep draught.When the time came, he went out into the garden to the heap of tan, and waited for the King’s daughter; but he became still more weary than on the day before, and lay down and slept as soundly as if he had been a stone.At two o’clock the raven came with four black horses, and the coachman and everything else was black.She was already in the deepest grief, and said, “I know that he is asleep and cannot deliver me.”When she came to him, there he was lying fast asleep.She shook him and called him, but she could not waken him.Then she laid a loaf beside him, and after that a piece of meat, and thirdly a bottle of wine, and he might consume as much of all of them as he liked, but they would never grow less.After this she took a gold ring from her finger, and put it on his, and her name was graven on it.Lastly, she laid a letter beside him wherein was written what she had given him, and that none of the things would ever grow less; and in it was also written, “I see right well that here you will never be able to deliver me, but if thou art still willing to deliver me, come to the golden castle of Stromberg; it lies in thy power, of that I am certain.”And when she had given him all these things, she seated herself in her carriage, and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >年轻人醒过来后，发现自己又睡着了，他心痛地说：“她一定赶着马车来过，可是我没能救她。”然后，他发现了身边的三件东西，读了她写的信，明白了发生过的一切。之后，他就起身准备去施特龙贝格的金宫，但却不知道金宫的位置。他花了很长时间，几乎走遍了世界。最后他走进了一片黑暗的森林，接连走了十四天依然没有找到出去的路。又到了晚上，他非常疲惫，躺在灌木丛里睡着了。第二天，他继续前行，到了晚上正当他又打算睡在灌木丛下，却听到了一阵大叫和哀嚎声，这让他毫无睡意。这时，人们点亮了蜡烛，他看见了闪烁的烛光，便起身朝那里走去。然后，他来到了一座看似很小的房子前，因为那里站着一个巨人。他想：“如果我进去，就会被巨人发现，说不准要没命的。”</td>
		<td class="en">When the man awoke and saw that he had slept, he was sad at heart, and said, “She has certainly driven by, and I have not set her free.”Then he perceived the things which were lying beside him, and read the letter wherein was written how everything had happened.So he arose and went away, intending to go to the golden castle of Stromberg, but he did not know where it was.After he had walked about the world for a long time, he entered into a dark forest, and walked for fourteen days, and still could not find his way out.Then it was once more evening, and he was so tired that he lay down in a thicket and fell asleep.Next day he went onwards, and in the evening, as he was again about to lie down beneath some bushes, he heard such a howling and crying that he could not go to sleep.And at the time when people light the candles, he saw one glimmering, and arose and went towards it.Then he came to a house which seemed very small, for in front of it a great giant was standing.He thought to himself, “If I go in, and the giant sees me, it will very likely cost me my life.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >最后，他还是冒险进去了。巨人一见他便说道：“你来得刚好，我好久没吃东西了，你即将成为我的晚餐了。”“我希望你还是不要这么做。“他说，“我不想被你吃了，但是你如果你想吃东西，我有足够的食物可以满足你。”“如果是这样的话，”巨人说：“我并不是非要吃你，只是没有其他可以吃的了。”然后他们一起进了小屋，在桌子旁边坐了下来。他拿出了面包，酒和肉，这些东西永远吃不完。“非常好。”巨人说着，便心满意足地吃起来。年轻人问巨人：“能告诉我施特龙贝格的金宫在哪里吗？”巨人说：“我在地图上找找。所有的城镇、村子和房屋都在上面找得到。”巨人从房间里拿来地图，却没有发现金宫。“不用担心！”巨人说，“我楼上的橱柜里还有更大的地图，我们再上那儿找找。”但是，那里也没有。他想继续赶路，但是巨人央求他在这儿多呆几天，等他出去找食物的哥哥回来再走。　巨人的哥哥回来后，他们问他是否知道去施特龙贝格金宫的路。他答道：“等我吃饱了，我就从地图上找找看。”于是他们就跟着巨人的哥哥来到了他的房间。他们在地图上找啊找，仍然没有找到。然后，巨人的哥哥又拿出了几张更旧的地图。他们顾不得休息，终于找到了施特龙贝格金宫，但却离这里有千里远。“我怎么才能到呢？”年轻人问。巨人说：“我有两个小时的空闲时间，我可以带你到那附近，但之后我必须回来喂孩子。”于是巨人带着他来到了距离金宫大约一百里格的地方。巨人说：“剩下的路你自己走就行了。”于是巨人回去了。年轻人日夜兼程，最后终于来到了施特龙贝格的金宫。金宫位于一座玻璃山上，被施了魔法的公主坐着车绕金宫转了一圈就进去了。他很高兴看到公主，想去追上她，但是每当他要往上爬，却总是从玻璃上滑下来。他发现自己追不上她，心里非常苦恼。想道：“那我就在山下等着她。”于是，他就给自己修了一座小屋，在那儿住了一年。每一天都会看见坐在车上的公主，但是却救不了她。有一天，他在小屋里看见有三个强盗打架，于是他冲他们大喊：“上帝保佑你们！”强盗们一听到说话声，便停下来，但却没有看见任何人。接着又殴打起来，毫不留情。于是他又大喊一声：“上帝保佑你们！”他们又停了下来，朝四周看去，仍然没有发现什么人，于是又殴打起来。于是他第三次喊：“上帝保佑你们！”他心想：“我得去看看他们为什么打架。”于是他便走过去询问他们为什么打得如此激烈。其中一个说他找到了一根棍子，只要用它敲门，门就会自动打开。第二个说他得到了一件斗篷，只要他穿上它，便可以隐身。第三个说他找到一匹马，骑着它可以去任何地方，即便是玻璃山也不在话下。而现在他们不知道应该共用这些东西还是各用各的。然后年轻人说：“我想用一些东西换你们这三件东西。我并没有钱，但我有更宝贵的东西。但首先我必须验证你们说的是否属实。”然后，他们扶他上马，把斗篷扔给了他，又把棍子递到他手里。他拿到这些后便隐身了，强盗们再也看不见他了。接着，他给他们一顿猛揍，喊道：“强盗们，这是你们的报应，满意了吧？”然后，他就骑马上了玻璃山。当他来到金宫门前，却发现门是关着的。于是他用棍子敲打金宫的门，门立即打开了。他走进去，爬上楼梯来到了大厅。被施了魔法的公主正坐在那里，前面放着一杯盛满酒的金色玻璃杯。但是，公主却看不见他，因为他穿着斗篷。他走上前，把公主给他的戒指摘下来放进杯子里，发出了清脆的声响。公主大叫道：“这是我的戒指，一定是救我的人来了。”她找遍了金宫的每一个角落都没有找到他。而他却出了金宫，骑上马，脱掉了斗篷。公主来到门口，看见了他，兴奋地呼喊着。然后他下了马，抱住公主。公主吻了他说道：“你已经救了我，我们明天就结婚吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">At length he ventured it and went in.When the giant saw him, he said, “It is well that thou comest, for it is long since I have eaten; I will at once eat thee for my supper.”“I’d rather you would leave that alone,” said the man, “I do not like to be eaten; but if thou hast any desire to eat, I have quite enough here to satisfy thee.”“If that be true,” said the giant, “thou mayst be easy, I was only going to devour thee because I had nothing else.”Then they went, and sat down to the table, and the man took out the bread, wine, and meat which would never come to an end.“This pleases me well,” said the giant, and ate to his heart’s content.Then the man said to him, Canst thou tell me where the golden castle of Stromberg is?”The giant said, “I will look at my map; all the towns, and villages, and houses are to be found on it.”He brought out the map which he had in the room and looked for the castle, but it was not to be found on it.“It’s no matter!” said he, “I have some still larger maps in my cupboard upstairs, and we will look in them.”But there, too, it was in vain.The man now wanted to go onwards, but the giant begged him to wait a few days longer until his brother, who had gone out to bring some provisions, came home.When the brother came home they inquired about the golden castle of Stromberg.He replied, “When I have eaten and have had enough, I will look in the map.”Then he went with them up to his chamber, and they searched in his map, but could not find it.Then he brought out still older maps, and they never rested until they found the golden castle of Stromberg, but it was many thousand miles away.“How am I to get there?” asked the man.The giant said, “I have two hours’ time, during which I will carry you into the neighbourhood, but after that I must be at home to suckle the child that we have.”So the giant carried the man to about a hundred leagues from the castle, and said, “Thou canst very well walk the rest of the way alone.”And he turned back, but the man went onwards day and night, until at length he came to the golden castle of Stromberg.It stood on a glass-mountain, and the bewitched maiden drove in her carriage round the castle, and then went inside it.He rejoiced when he saw her and wanted to climb up to her, but when he began to do so he always slipped down the glass again.And when he saw that he could not reach her, he was filled with trouble, and said to himself, “I will stay down here below, and wait for her.”So he built himself a hut and stayed in it for a whole year, and every day saw the King’s daughter driving about above, but never could go to her.Then one day he saw from his hut three robbers who were beating each other, and cried to them, “God be with ye!”They stopped when they heard the cry, but as they saw no one, they once more began to beat each other, and that too most dangerously.So he again cried, “God be with ye!”Again they stopped, looked round about, but as they saw no one they went on beating each other.Then he cried for the third time, “God be with ye,” and thought, “I must see what these three are about,” and went thither and asked why they were beating each other so furiously.One of them said that he found a stick, and that when he struck a door with it, that door would spring open.The next said that he had found a mantle, and that whenever he put it on, he was invisible, but the third said he had found a horse on which a man could ride everywhere, even up the glass-mountain.And now they did not know whether they ought to have these things in common, or whether they ought to divide them.Then the man said, “I will give you something in exchange for these three things.Money indeed have I not, but I have other things of more value; but first I must try yours to see if you have told the truth.”Then they put him on the horse, threw the mantle round him, and gave him the stick in his hand, and when he had all these things they were no longer able to see him.So he gave them some vigorous blows and cried, “Now, vagabonds, you have got what you deserve, are you satisfied?”And he rode up the glass-mountain, but when he came in front of the castle at the top, it was shut.Then he struck the door with his stick, and it sprang open immediately.He went in and ascended the stairs until he came to the hall where the maiden was sitting with a golden cup full of wine before her.She, however, could not see him because he had the mantle on.And when he came up to her, he drew from his finger the ring which she had given him, and threw it into the cup so that it rang.Then she cried, “That is my ring, so the man who is to set me free must be here.”They searched the whole castle and did not find him, but he had gone out, and had seated himself on the horse and thrown off the mantle.When they came to the door, they saw him and cried aloud in their delight.Then he alighted and took the King’s daughter in his arms, but she kissed him and said, “Now hast thou set me free, and to-morrow we will celebrate our wedding.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But the eyelids of the prince grew heavy as lead, and he fell asleep, and when he awoke in the morning, all twelve had been to the dance, for their shoes were standing there with holes in the soles.On the second and third nights it fell out just the same, and then his head was struck off without mercy.Many others came after this and undertook the enterprise, but all forfeited their lives.Now it came to pass that a poor soldier, who had a wound, and could serve no longer, found himself on the road to the town where the King lived.There he met an old woman, who asked him where he was going.“I hardly know myself,” answered he, and added in jest, “I had half a mind to discover where the princesses danced their shoes into holes, and thus become King.”“That is not so difficult,” said the old woman, “you must not drink the wine which will be brought to you at night, and must pretend to be sound asleep.”With that she gave him a little cloak, and said, “If you put on that, you will be invisible, and then you can steal after the twelve.”When the soldier had received this good advice, he went into the thing in earnest, took heart, went to the King, and announced himself as a suitor.He was as well received as the others, and royal garments were put upon him.He was conducted that evening at bed-time into the ante-chamber, and as he was about to go to bed, the eldest came and brought him a cup of wine, but he had tied a sponge under his chin, and let the wine run down into it, without drinking a drop.Then he lay down and when he had lain a while, he began to snore, as if in the deepest sleep.The twelve princesses heard that, and laughed, and the eldest said, “He, too, might as well have saved his life.”With that they got up, opened wardrobes, presses, cupboards, and brought out pretty dresses; dressed themselves before the mirrors, sprang about, and rejoiced at the prospect of the dance.Only the youngest said, “I know not how it is; you are very happy, but I feel very strange; some misfortune is certainly about to befall us.”“Thou art a goose, who art always frightened,” said the eldest.“Hast thou forgotten how many Kings’ sons have already come here in vain?I had hardly any need to give the soldier a sleeping-draught, in any case the clown would not have awakened.”When they were all ready they looked carefully at the soldier, but he had closed his eyes and did not move or stir, so they felt themselves quite secure.The eldest then went to her bed and tapped it; it immediately sank into the earth, and one after the other they descended through the opening, the eldest going first.The soldier, who had watched everything, tarried no longer, put on his little cloak, and went down last with the youngest.Half-way down the steps, he just trod a little on her dress; she was terrified at that, and cried out, “What is that?who is pulling my dress?”“Don’t be so silly!” said the eldest, “you have caught it on a nail.”Then they went all the way down, and when they were at the bottom, they were standing in a wonderfully pretty avenue of trees, all the leaves of which were of silver, and shone and glistened.The soldier thought, “I must carry a token away with me,” and broke off a twig from one of them, on which the tree cracked with a loud report.The youngest cried out again.“Something is wrong, did you hear the crack?”But the eldest said, “It is a gun fired for joy, because we have got rid of our prince so quickly.”After that they came into an avenue where all the leaves were of gold, and lastly into a third where they were of bright diamonds; he broke off a twig from each, which made such a crack each time that the youngest started back in terror, but the eldest still maintained that they were salutes.They went on and came to a great lake whereon stood twelve little boats, and in every boat sat a handsome prince, all of whom were waiting for the twelve, and each took one of them with him, but the soldier seated himself by the youngest.Then her prince said, “I can’t tell why the boat is so much heavier today; I shall have to row with all my strength, if I am to get it across.”“What should cause that,” said the youngest, “but the warm weather? I feel very warm too.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">There was once a poor woodcutter who toiled from early morning till late night.When at last he had laid by some money he said to his boy, “You are my only child, I will spend the money which I have earned with the sweat of my brow on your education; if you learn some honest trade you can support me in my old age, when my limbs have grown stiff and I am obliged to stay at home.”Then the boy went to a High School and learned diligently so that his masters praised him, and he remained there a long time.When he had worked through two classes, but was still not yet perfect in everything, the little pittance which the father had earned was all spent, and the boy was obliged to return home to him.“Ah,” said the father, sorrowfully, “I can give you no more, and in these hard times I cannot earn a farthing more than will suffice for our daily bread.”“Dear father,” answered the son, “don’t trouble yourself about it, if it is God’s will, it will turn to my advantage I shall soon accustom myself to it.”When the father wanted to go into the forest to earn money by helping to pile and stack wood and also chop it, the son said, “I will go with you and help you.”“Nay, my son,” said the father, “that would be hard for you; you are not accustomed to rough work, and will not be able to bear it, besides I have only one axe and no money left wherewith to buy another.”“Just go to the neighbour,” answered the son, “he will lend you his axe until I have earned one for myself.”The father then borrowed an axe of the neighbour, and next morning at break of day they went out into the forest together.The son helped his father and was quite merry and brisk about it.But when the sun was right over their heads, the father said, “We will rest, and have our dinner, and then we shall work as well again.”The son took his bread in his hands, and said, “Just you rest, father, I am not tired; I will walk up and down a little in the forest, and look for birds’ nests.”“Oh, you fool,” said the father, “why should you want to run about there?Afterwards you will be tired, and no longer able to raise your arm; stay here, and sit down beside me.”The son, however, went into the forest, ate his bread, was very merry and peered in among the green branches to see if he could discover a bird’s nest anywhere.So he went up and down to see if he could find a bird’s nest until at last he came to a great dangerous-looking oak, which certainly was already many hundred years old, and which five men could not have spanned.He stood still and looked at it, and thought, “Many a bird must have built its nest in that.”Then all at once it seemed to him that he heard a voice.He listened and became aware that someone was crying in a very smothered voice, “Let me out, let me out!”He looked around, but could discover nothing; nevertheless, he fancied that the voice came out of the ground.Then he cried, “Where art thou?”The voice answered, “I am down here amongst the roots of the oak-tree.Let me out!Let me out!”The scholar began to loosen the earth under the tree, and search among the roots, until at last he found a glass bottle in a little hollow.He lifted it up and held it against the light, and then saw a creature shaped like a frog, springing up and down in it.“Let me out!Let me out!” it cried anew, and the scholar thinking no evil, drew the cork out of the bottle.Immediately a spirit ascended from it, and began to grow, and grew so fast that in a very few moments he stood before the scholar, a terrible fellow as big as half the tree by which he was standing.“Knowest thou,” he cried in an awful voice, “what thy wages are for having let me out?”“No,” replied the scholar fearlessly, “how should I know that?”“Then I will tell thee,” cried the spirit; “I must strangle thee for it.”“Thou shouldst have told me that sooner,” said the scholar, “for I should then have left thee shut up, but my head shall stand fast for all thou canst do; more persons than one must be consulted about that.”“More persons here, more persons there,” said the spirit.“Thou shalt have the wages thou hast earned.Dost thou think that I was shut up there for such a long time as a favour.No, it was a punishment for me.I am the mighty Mercurius.Whoso releases me, him must I strangle.”“Softly,” answered the scholar, “not so fast.I must first know that thou really were shut up in that little bottle, and that thou art the right spirit.If, indeed, thou canst get in again, I will believe and then thou mayst do as thou wilt with me.”The spirit said haughtily, “that is a very trifling feat,” drew himself together, and made himself as small and slender as he had been at first, so that he crept through the same opening, and right through the neck of the bottle in again.Scarcely was he within than the scholar thrust the cork he had drawn back into the bottle, and threw it among the roots of the oak into its old place, and the spirit was betrayed.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从前有一个年轻漂亮的女孩，但很小就失去了妈妈，继母用尽各种手段折磨她，女孩的生活痛苦不堪。每当继母让她做事，她都不辞辛苦，尽力完成。坏心肠的继母一点也不为之感动，女孩怎么做她都不满意，都感到不够。女孩越是努力，继母越要变本加厉，那个女人想的是如何用更重的担子把她压垮，如何让她的生活更加悲惨。一天继母对她说：“这里有十二磅羽毛，你天黑之前必须撕完，否则就等着挨揍吧。你还想整天游手好闲吗？”可怜的女孩坐下来开始干活儿，泪水从脸颊滚落下来，因为她清楚地知道，这些活儿是不可能在一天内干完的。每当她把撕好的一小堆羽毛放在面前，悲痛地叹气或是合上双手时，羽毛便飞走了，她不得不把它们捡回来，再重新干。她把胳膊肘放在桌子上，双手托着脸，呜咽着：“难道在这个世界上就没有一个人同情我吗？”这时她听到了一个低沉的声音：“孩子，放心吧，我来帮你。”女孩抬起头，看到一个老妇人站在她旁边。她慈祥地拉起女孩的手，说道：“把你的委屈告诉我吧。”老妇人说话温和亲切，女孩便向她诉说了自己悲惨的生活：重担一个接一个，而那些活儿多得做也做不完。“如果天黑之前撕不完这些羽毛，继母就会打我。她威胁我说她一定会的，我知道她说到做到。”她的眼泪又开始往下流，但是慈祥的老妇人说：“孩子，不要怕，休息一会儿，我帮你做。”女孩躺在床上，很快就睡着了。老妇人在堆满羽毛的桌旁坐了下来，她满是皱纹的手甚至连碰都没碰一下，羽绒忽地就飞离了羽茎。十二磅羽毛很快就撕完了，女孩醒来时，地上是一堆堆雪白的羽毛，房子里打扫得干干净净，但老妇人却消失了。女孩感谢上帝，她一直安静地坐到晚上。继母进来看到活儿已干完，不禁大吃一惊。“看吧，你这个笨手笨脚的家伙，”她说，“只要勤勤恳恳，就没有做不到的事。你为什么不再做点别的呢？就知道俩手叉着坐在那儿。”她出去后嘟哝道：“这孩子还能多干些。我一定要让她干更难的活儿。”第二天早上，她对女孩说：“这有个汤匙，你必须用它舀干花园旁边大池塘里的水，如果晚上之前做不完，你知道会有什么后果。”女孩接过汤匙，发现上面全是洞。即使没有洞，用汤匙舀干一池子水也是不可能的。女孩马上去干活儿，她跪在水边，开始往外舀水，泪水不停地掉进水里。但是慈祥的老妇人再次出现了，她得知女孩伤心的原因之后，说道：“孩子，别难过了。去树林里睡会儿吧，我这就帮你做。”女孩刚走，老妇人只是稍稍碰了下池塘，一片水汽就从水面升起，与云彩混为了一体。池塘渐渐空了，太阳下山之前女孩醒了，她走到池塘边，只看到一些鱼儿在淤泥里挣扎。她走到继母那里，告诉她活儿已经干完了。“应该更早一点干完的！”继母说。她气得脸色煞白，可是很快又想出了新招。第三天早上她对女孩说：“你必须在那片平地上给我盖一座城堡，晚上之前必须盖完。”女孩很惊愕，说：“这样大的工程，我怎么可能干的完啊！”“你给我闭嘴。”继母高声叫喊着，“你能用满是洞的汤匙舀干池塘，那你也能盖完一座城堡。今天我就要住进去，如果缺了什么东西，哪怕是厨房或地下室的小杂碎，你就等着我收拾你吧！”她把女孩赶了出去，女孩走进山谷，里面堆满了石块。她即便用上浑身力气，也搬不动最小的一块。她哭着坐下来，她多么希望老妇人能来帮助她。老妇人很快就来了，她安慰女孩说：“去阴凉处躺下睡会儿吧，我很快就能帮你盖完。如果你喜欢的话，你可以住在里面。”女孩离开后，老妇人轻轻碰了下那些灰色的石块。石块开始上升，很快聚集到一起，就像有巨人在建造墙壁一般。城堡拔地而起，好像有无数双隐形的手在不停地垒着石块。随着地上一声混沌的声响，擎天巨柱高高耸起，自行排列得整整齐齐。屋顶上瓦片排列得错落有致，中午时分，城堡顶部竖起了风标，宛如长衣飘飘的美丽姑娘。夜晚临近时，城堡内部也修饰完了。老妇人是怎样做到的，我无从知晓。房间的墙壁上挂着绸缎丝绒，屋里放着绣着花的椅子，装饰精美的扶手椅配着大理石桌，从天花板垂下的水晶枝形吊灯，映射在光滑的地面上。金笼子里有绿色的鹦鹉，还以很多珍稀的小鸟，唱着最优美的曲调。整个城堡恢宏壮丽，就像给国王准备的一样。太阳快要下山时，女孩醒了，城堡里成千盏明灯映射着她的脸庞。她急冲冲地跑向城堡，穿过敞开的门来到了城堡。台阶上都铺着红布，金色的扶手四周环绕着鲜花盛开的树木。看到富丽的殿堂，女孩站在那儿一动不动，仿佛变成了一块石头。要不是想起了继母，谁知道女孩会在这里伫立多久呢？“啊！”她自言自语道，“希望她能因此而满足，不再折磨我了。”女孩走到继母那，告诉她城堡已经盖好了。“我要马上住进去。”继母说着，从座位上站起来。她们一进城堡，继母不得不用双手挡住眼睛，这里的东西太耀眼了。“你瞧，”她对女孩说，“这对你来说易如反掌，应该让你做些更困难的活儿。”她走遍了所有的房间，仔细检查每个角落，看看是不是有什么缺点或不足，可她却发现不了有什么问题。</td>
		<td class="en">There was once on a time a girl who was young and beautiful, but she had lost her mother when she was quite a child, and her step-mother did all she could to make the girl’s life wretched.Whenever this woman gave her anything to do, she worked at it indefatigably, and did everything that lay in her power.Still she could not touch the heart of the wicked woman by that; she was never satisfied; it was never enough.The harder the girl worked, the more work was put upon her, and all that the woman thought of was how to weigh her down with still heavier burdens, and make her life still more miserable.One day she said to her, “Here are twelve pounds of feathers which thou must pick, and if they are not done this evening, thou mayst expect a good beating.Dost thou imagine thou art to idle away the whole day?”The poor girl sat down to the work, but tears ran down her cheeks as she did so, for she saw plainly enough that it was quite impossible to finish the work in one day.Whenever she had a little heap of feathers lying before her, and she sighed or smote her hands together in her anguish, they flew away, and she had to pick them out again, and begin her work anew.Then she put her elbows on the table, laid her face in her two hands, and cried, “Is there no one, then, on God’s earth to have pity on me?”Then she heard a low voice which said, “Be comforted, my child, I have come to help thee.”The maiden looked up, and an old woman was by her side.She took the girl kindly by the hand, and said, “Only tell me what is troubling thee.”As she spoke so kindly, the girl told her of her miserable life, and how one burden after another was laid upon her, and she never could get to the end of the work which was given to her.“If I have not done these feathers by this evening, my step-mother will beat me; she has threatened she will, and I know she keeps her word.”Her tears began to flow again, but the good old woman said, “Do not be afraid, my child; rest a while, and in the meantime I will look to thy work.”The girl lay down on her bed, and soon fell asleep.The old woman seated herself at the table with the feathers, and how they did fly off the quills, which she scarcely touched with her withered hands!The twelve pounds were soon finished, and when the girl awoke, great snow-white heaps were lying, piled up, and everything in the room was neatly cleared away, but the old woman had vanished.The maiden thanked God, and sat still till evening came, when the step-mother came in and marvelled to see the work completed.“Just look, you awkward creature,” said she, “what can be done when people are industrious; and why couldst thou not set about something else?There thou sittest with thy hands crossed.”When she went out she said, “The creature is worth more than her salt.I must give her some work that is still harder.”Next morning she called the girl, and said, “There is a spoon for thee; with that thou must empty out for me the great pond which is beside the garden, and if it is not done by night, thou knowest what will happen.”The girl took the spoon, and saw that it was full of holes; but even if it had not been, she never could have emptied the pond with it.She set to work at once, knelt down by the water, into which her tears were falling, and began to empty it.But the good old woman appeared again, and when she learnt the cause of her grief, she said, “Be of good cheer, my child.Go into the thicket and lie down and sleep; I will soon do thy work.”As soon as the old woman was alone, she barely touched the pond, and a vapour rose up on high from the water, and mingled itself with the clouds.Gradually the pond was emptied, and when the maiden awoke before sunset and came thither, she saw nothing but the fishes which were struggling in the mud.She went to her step-mother, and showed her that the work was done.“It ought to have been done long before this,” said she, and grew white with anger, but she meditated something new.On the third morning she said to the girl, “Thou must build me a castle on the plain there, and it must be ready by the evening.”The maiden was dismayed, and said, “How can I complete such a great work?”“I will endure no opposition,” screamed the step-mother.“If thou canst empty a pond with a spoon that is full of holes, thou canst build a castle too.I will take possession of it this very day, and if anything is wanting, even if it be the most trifling thing in the kitchen or cellar, thou knowest what lies before thee!”She drove the girl out, and when she entered the valley, the rocks were there, piled up one above the other, and all her strength would not have enabled her even to move the very smallest of them.She sat down and wept, and still she hoped the old woman would help her.The old woman was not long in coming; she comforted her and said, “Lie down there in the shade and sleep, and I will soon build the castle for thee.If it would be a pleasure to thee, thou canst live in it thyself.”When the maiden had gone away, the old woman touched the gray rocks.They began to rise, and immediately moved together as if giants had built the walls; and on these the building arose, and it seemed as if countless hands were working invisibly, and placing one stone upon another.There was a dull heavy noise from the ground; pillars arose of their own accord on high, and placed themselves in order near each other.The tiles laid themselves in order on the roof, and when noon-day came, the great weather-cock was already turning itself on the summit of the tower, like a golden figure of the Virgin with fluttering garments.The inside of the castle was being finished while evening was drawing near.How the old woman managed it, I know not; but the walls of the rooms were hung with silk and velvet, embroidered chairs were there, and richly ornamented arm-chairs by marble tables; crystal chandeliers hung down from the ceilings, and mirrored themselves in the smooth pavement; green parrots were there in gilt cages, and so were strange birds which sang most beautifully, and there was on all sides as much magnificence as if a king were going to live there.The sun was just setting when the girl awoke, and the brightness of a thousand lights flashed in her face.She hurried to the castle, and entered by the open door.The steps were spread with red cloth, and the golden balustrade beset with flowering trees.When she saw the splendour of the apartment, she stood as if turned to stone.Who knows how long she might have stood there if she had not remembered the step-mother?“Alas!” she said to herself, “if she could but be satisfied at last, and would give up making my life a misery to me.”The girl went and told her that the castle was ready.“I will move into it at once,” said she, and rose from her seat.When they entered the castle, she was forced to hold her hand before her eyes, the brilliancy of everything was so dazzling.“Thou seest,” said she to the girl, “how easy it has been for thee to do this; I ought to have given thee something harder.”She went through all the rooms, and examined every corner to see if anything was wanting or defective; but she could discover nothing.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Now we will go down below,” said she, looking at the girl with malicious eyes. “The kitchen and the cellar still have to be examined, and if thou hast forgotten anything thou shalt not escape thy punishment.”But the fire was burning on the hearth, and the meat was cooking in the pans, the tongs and shovel were leaning against the wall, and the shining brazen utensils all arranged in sight.Nothing was wanting, not even a coal-box and water-pail.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“怎么去地下室？”继母喊道，“如果里面没有放满东西，我也不会放过你。”女孩自己一个人打开地板门下去了，但是还没走两步，刚刚放在后面重重的地板门便掉下来了。女孩听到一声尖叫，赶紧抬起门去救继母，可她已经摔了下去，女孩看到她直挺挺地躺在下面，死了。现在恢宏壮丽的城堡属于女孩一个人了。起初，她不知道该如何面对这突然的好运。衣橱里挂着漂亮的裙子，箱子里装满了金银珠宝，女孩要什么有什么。很快女孩的美貌和富有就传遍了整个世界。每天都有追求者上门拜访，但没有一个她喜欢的。终于国王的儿子来了，他搏得了她的芳心，女孩跟他订婚了。城堡的花园里有一棵酸橙树，有一天他们在树下坐着，国王的儿子对女孩说：“我要回家，让父亲同意我们的婚事。我恳求你能在这棵树下等我，不用几个小时我就回来了。”女孩亲了一下他的左脸颊，说：“不要背叛我，也不要让任何人吻你的左脸。我会在这棵酸橙树下等你回来。”女孩一直在酸橙树下等，太阳落山了，他还没有回来。之后的三天，女孩从早等到晚，但仍是徒劳。第四天他仍然没有出现，女孩说：“他一定发生了什么意外。我要出去找他，找不到，我就不回来。”她收拾好三条最漂亮的裙子，第一条镶有闪烁的星星，第二条镶有银色的月亮，第三条镶有金色的太阳，又在手绢里放了一把珠宝，然后出发了。她为找到未婚夫问遍了所有的人，但是没有人见过他，没有人认识他。她游荡到了很远的地方，还是没有找到他。最后，她在一个农夫家里作了放牧女，把裙子和珠宝都埋在了一块石头下面。</td>
		<td class="en">“Which is the way to the cellar?” she cried. “If that is not abundantly filled, it shall go ill with thee.”She herself raised up the trap-door and descended; but she had hardly made two steps before the heavy trap-door which was only laid back, fell down.The girl heard a scream, lifted up the door very quickly to go to her aid, but she had fallen down, and the girl found her lying lifeless at the bottom.And now the magnificent castle belonged to the girl alone.She at first did not know how to reconcile herself to her good fortune.Beautiful dresses were hanging in the wardrobes, the chests were filled with gold or silver, or with pearls and jewels, and she never felt a desire that she was not able to gratify.And soon the fame of the beauty and riches of the maiden went over all the world.Wooers presented themselves daily, but none pleased her.At length the son of the King came and he knew how to touch her heart, and she betrothed herself to him.In the garden of the castle was a lime-tree, under which they were one day sitting together, when he said to her, “I will go home and obtain my father’s consent to our marriage.I entreat thee to wait for me here under this lime-tree, I shall be back with thee in a few hours.”The maiden kissed him on his left cheek, and said, “Keep true to me, and never let any one else kiss thee on this cheek.I will wait here under the lime-tree until thou returnest.”The maid stayed beneath the lime-tree until sunset, but he did not return.She sat three days from morning till evening, waiting for him, but in vain.As he still was not there by the fourth day, she said, “Some accident has assuredly befallen him.I will go out and seek him, and will not come back until I have found him.”She packed up three of her most beautiful dresses, one embroidered with bright stars, the second with silver moons, the third with golden suns, tied up a handful of jewels in her handkerchief, and set out.She inquired everywhere for her betrothed, but no one had seen him; no one knew anything about him.Far and wide did she wander through the world, but she found him not.At last she hired herself to a farmer as a cow-herd, and buried her dresses and jewels beneath a stone.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The host said, “I should indeed like to see that,” but he would make no more wagers.The huntsman called the fox and said, “My little fox, go and fetch me some roast meat, such as the King eats.”The red fox knew the bye-ways better, and went by holes and corners without any dog seeing him, seated himself under the chair of the King’s daughter, and scratched her foot.Then she looked down and recognized the fox by its collar, took him into her chamber with her and said, “Dear fox, what dost thou want?”He answered, “My master, who killed the dragon, is here, and has sent me.I am to ask for some roast meat such as the King is eating.”Then she made the cook come, who was obliged to prepare a roast joint, the same as was eaten by the King, and to carry it for the fox as far as the door.Then the fox took the dish, waved away with his tail the flies which had settled on the meat, and then carried it to his master.“Behold, sir host,” said the huntsman, “bread and meat are here but now I will also have proper vegetables with it, such as are eaten by the King.”Then he called the wolf, and said, “Dear Wolf, go thither and fetch me vegetables such as the King eats.”Then the wolf went straight to the palace, as he feared no one, and when he got to the King’s daughter’s chamber, he twitched at the back of her dress, so that she was forced to look round.She recognized him by his collar, and took him into her chamber with her, and said, “Dear Wolf, what dost thou want?”He answered, “My master, who killed the dragon, is here, I am to ask for some vegetables, such as the King eats.”Then she made the cook come, and he had to make ready a dish of vegetables, such as the King ate, and had to carry it for the wolf as far as the door, and then the wolf took the dish from him, and carried it to his master.“Behold, sir host,” said the huntsman, “now I have bread and meat and vegetables, but I will also have some pastry to eat like that which the King eats.”He called the bear, and said, “Dear Bear, thou art fond of licking anything sweet; go and bring me some confectionery, such as the King eats.”Then the bear trotted to the palace, and every one got out of his way, but when he went to the guard, they presented their muskets, and would not let him go into the royal palace.But he got up on his hind legs, and gave them a few boxes on the ears, right and left, with his paws, so that the whole watch broke up, and then he went straight to the King’s daughter, placed himself behind her, and growled a little.Then she looked behind her, knew the bear, and bade him go into her room with her, and said, “Dear Bear, what dost thou want?”He answered, “My master, who killed the dragon, is here, and I am to ask for some confectionery, such as the King eats.”Then she summoned her confectioner, who had to bake confectionery such as the King ate, and carry it to the door for the bear; then the bear first licked up the comfits which had rolled down, and then he stood upright, took the dish, and carried it to his master.“Behold, sir host,” said the huntsman, “now I have bread, meat, vegetables and confectionery, but I will drink wine also, and such as the King drinks.”He called his lion to him and said, “Dear Lion, thou thyself likest to drink till thou art intoxicated, go and fetch me some wine, such as is drunk by the King.”Then the lion strode through the streets, and the people fled from him, and when he came to the watch, they wanted to bar the way against him, but he did but roar once, and they all ran away.Then the lion went to the royal apartment, and knocked at the door with his tail.Then the King’s daughter came forth, and was almost afraid of the lion, but she knew him by the golden clasp of her necklace, and bade him go with her into her chamber, and said, “Dear Lion, what wilt thou have?”He answered, “My master, who killed the dragon, is here, and I am to ask for some wine such as is drunk by the King.”Then she bade the cup-bearer be called, who was to give the lion some wine like that which was drunk by the King.The lion said, “I will go with him, and see that I get the right wine.”Then he went down with the cup-bearer, and when they were below, the cup-bearer wanted to draw him some of the common wine that was drunk by the King’s servants, but the lion said, “Stop, I will taste the wine first,” and he drew half a measure, and swallowed it down at one draught.“No,” said he, “that is not right.”The cup-bearer looked at him askance, but went on, and was about to give him some out of another barrel which was for the King’s marshal.The lion said, “Stop, let me taste the wine first,” and drew half a measure and drank it.“That is better, but still not right,” said he.Then the cup-bearer grew angry and said, “How can a stupid animal like you understand wine?”But the lion gave him a blow behind the ears, which made him fall down by no means gently, and when he had got up again, he conducted the lion quite silently into a little cellar apart, where the King’s wine lay, from which no one ever drank.The lion first drew half a measure and tried the wine, and then he said, That may possibly be the right sort, and bade the cup-bearer fill six bottles of it.And now they went upstairs again, but when the lion came out of the cellar into the open air, he reeled here and there, and was rather drunk, and the cup-bearer was forced to carry the wine as far as the door for him, and then the lion took the handle of the basket in his mouth, and took it to his master.The huntsman said, “Behold, sir host, here have I bread, meat, vegetables, confectionery and wine such as the King has, and now I will dine with my animals,” and he sat down and ate and drank, and gave the hare, the fox, the wolf, the bear, and the lion also to eat and to drink, and was joyful, for he saw that the King’s daughter still loved him.And when he had finished his dinner, he said, “Sir host, now have I eaten and drunk, as the King eats and drinks, and now I will go to the King’s court and marry the King’s daughter.”Said the host, “How can that be, when she already has a betrothed husband, and when the wedding is to be solemnized today?”Then the huntsman drew forth the handkerchief which the King’s daughter had given him on the dragon’s hill, and in which were folded the monster’s seven tongues, and said, “That which I hold in my hand shall help me to do it.”Then the innkeeper looked at the handkerchief, and said, “Whatever I believe, I do not believe that, and I am willing to stake my house and courtyard on it.”The huntsman, however, took a bag with a thousand gold pieces, put it on the table, and said, “I stake that on it.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">After a while he again said to himself, “Time is beginning to pass heavily with me here in the forest, I will fetch hither another companion.” and took his fiddle and again played in the forest.It was not long before a fox came creeping through the trees towards him.“Ah, there’s a fox coming!” said the musician.“I have no desire for him.”The fox came up to him and said, “Oh, dear musician, how beautifully thou dost play!I should like to learn that too.”“That is soon learnt,” said the musician.“Thou hast only to do everything that I bid thee.”“Oh, musician,” then said the fox, “I will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master.”“Follow me,” said the musician; and when they had walked a part of the way, they came to a footpath, with high bushes on both sides of it.There the musician stood still, and from one side bent a young hazel-bush down to the ground, and put his foot on the top of it, then he bent down a young tree from the other side as well, and said, “Now little fox, if thou wilt learn something, give me thy left front paw.”The fox obeyed, and the musician fastened his paw to the left bough.“Little fox,” said he, “now reach me thy right paw” and he tied it to the right bough.When he had examined whether they were firm enough, he let go, and the bushes sprang up again, and jerked up the little fox, so that it hung struggling in the air.“Wait there till I come back again,” said the musician, and went his way.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >乐师又自言自语道：“一个人在森林里的日子开始难熬了，我得给自己找个好伙伴。”因此他又拉起了小提琴，让音乐在森林中回响。这时，一只小野兔向他跳了过来。“哦，来了一只野兔，”乐师说，“我可不想跟它一起。”“啊，亲爱的乐师，”野兔说，“你拉的小提琴曲好美啊，我也想学呢。”“这很好学，”乐师说，“你只要照我说的去做就好了。”</td>
		<td class="en">Again he said to himself, “Time is beginning to pass heavily with me here in the forest, I will fetch hither another companion,” so he took his fiddle, and the sound echoed through the forest.Then a little hare came springing towards him.“Why, a hare is coming,” said the musician, “I do not want him.”“Ah, dear musician,” said the hare, “how beautifully thou dost fiddle; I too, should like to learn that.”“That is soon learnt,” said the musician, “thou hast only to do everything that I bid thee.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，乐师，”小野兔答道，“我会像学生听老师的话一样服从您的。”他们一起走了一段路，来到了森林里的一片空地上，那里有一棵山杨树。乐师用一条长绳系住小野兔的脖子，又把绳子的另一端系在了树上。“好了，我活泼的小野兔，绕着树跑二十圈吧！”乐师大声说。小野兔照着做了，但当它绕着树跑完二十圈后，绳子也绕着树缠了二十圈，于是野兔被缠在了树干上，而且无论它怎么拉怎么扯，都只能使绳子在它脆弱的脖子上勒得更深。“在这儿等我回来。”乐师说完，又继续走了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, musician,” replied the little hare, “I will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master.”They went a part of the way together until they came to an open space in the forest, where stood an aspen tree.The musician tied a long string round the little hare’s neck, the other end of which he fastened to the tree.“Now briskly, little hare, run twenty times round the tree!” cried the musician, and the little hare obeyed, and when it had run round twenty times, it had twisted the string twenty times round the trunk of the tree, and the little hare was caught, and let it pull and tug as it liked, it only made the string cut into its tender neck.“Wait there till I come back,” said the musician, and went onwards.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在此期间，狼不断地又推又拉地咬那块石头，折腾了好久，最后终于把脚从裂缝里再次抽了出来，可以自由活动了。狼愤怒不已，向乐师离开的方向紧追过去，一心想把他撕成碎片。狐狸看到狼跑过，便开始哀号，并用尽全身的力气喊到：“狼兄弟，快来帮我啊，那个乐师辜负了我！”狼拉下了那棵小树，把绳子咬成两断，救出了狐狸，然后带着狐狸一起去找乐师报仇。它们又看到了被缠在树上的野兔，于是把野兔也救了出来，然后一起去找它们的仇人。</td>
		<td class="en">The wolf, in the meantime, had pushed and pulled and bitten at the stone, and had worked so long that he had set his feet at liberty and had drawn them once more out of the cleft.Full of anger and rage he hurried after the musician and wanted to tear him to pieces.When the fox saw him running, he began to lament, and cried with all his might, “Brother wolf, come to my help, the musician has betrayed me!”The wolf drew down the little tree, bit the cord in two, and freed the fox, who went with him to take revenge on the musician.They found the tied-up hare, whom likewise they delivered, and then they all sought the enemy together.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这时，乐师又一次在路上拉起了他的小提琴。这一次，他比较幸运。琴声飘入了一个穷伐木工人的耳朵里。他立刻情不自禁地放下了手中的工作，把斧子挟在腋下走过来听音乐。“我想要的同伴终于来了，”乐师说，“因为我要找一个人作伴，而不是一只野兽。”于是，他开始弹奏了，把乐曲弹奏得那么美丽而欢快，以至于那个穷伐木工人站在原地，像是被施了魔法似的，心中充满了快乐。就在此时，狼、狐狸和野兔出现了，伐木工人一眼就看出它们来者不善。于是，他举起被磨得锃亮的斧头站在乐师的前面，好像在说：“谁要是想碰他就给我小心着点儿，因为要动他就得先跟我斗！”于是，这些野兽都被吓得跑回了森林里。然而，乐师出于谢意，把曲子又给伐木工人演奏了一遍，之后就一个人上路走了。</td>
		<td class="en">The musician had once more played his fiddle as he went on his way, and this time he had been more fortunate.The sound reached the ears of a poor wood-cutter, who instantly, whether he would or no, gave up his work and came with his hatchet under his arm to listen to the music.“At last comes the right companion,” said the musician, “for I was seeking a human being, and no wild beast.”And he began and played so beautifully and delightfully that the poor man stood there as if bewitched, and his heart leaped with gladness.And as he thus stood, the wolf, the fox, and the hare came up, and he saw well that they had some evil design.So he raised his glittering axe and placed himself before the musician, as if to say, “Whoso wishes to touch him let him beware, for he will have to do with me!”Then the beasts were terrified and ran back into the forest.The musician, however, played once more to the man out of gratitude, and then went onwards.</td></tr>

we are going into the wood, and thou must go with us.”“Ah,” said he quite roughly and surlily, “you may just go, then; I shall be back again before any of you.”Then the others went to the bailiff, and told him that the head-man was still lying in bed, and would not go into the wood with them.The bailiff said they were to awaken him again, and tell him to harness the horses.The head-man, however, said as before, “Just go there, I shall be back again before any of you.”And then he stayed in bed two hours longer.At length he arose from the feathers, but first he got himself two bushels of peas from the loft, made himself some broth with them, ate it at his leisure, and when that was done, went and harnessed the horses, and drove into the wood.Not far from the wood was a ravine through which he had to pass, so he first drove the horses on, and then stopped them, and went behind the cart, took trees and brushwood, and made a great barricade, so that no horse could get through.When he was entering the wood, the others were just driving out of it with their loaded carts to go home; then said he to them, “Drive on, I will still get home before you do.”He did not drive far into the wood, but at once tore two of the very largest trees of all out of the earth, threw them on his cart, and turned round.When he came to the barricade, the others were still standing there, not able to get through.“Don’t you see,” said he, “that if you had stayed with me, you would have got home just as quickly, and would have had another hour’s sleep?”He now wanted to drive on, but his horeses could not work their way through, so he unharnessed them, laid them on the top of the cart, took the shafts in his own hands, and pulled it all through, and he did this just as easily as if it had been laden with feathers.When he was over, he said to the others, “There, you see, I have got over quicker than you,” and drove on, and the others had to stay where they were.In the yard, however, he took a tree in his hand, showed it to the bailiff, and said, “Isn’t that a fine bundle of wood?”Then said the bailiff to his wife, “The servant is a good one, if he does sleep long, he is still home before the others.”So he served the bailiff for a year, and when that was over, and the other servants were getting their wages, he said it was time for him to take his too.The bailiff, however, was afraid of the blows which he was to receive, and earnestly entreated him to excuse him from having them; for rather than that, he himself would be head-servant, and the youth should be bailiff.“No,” said he, “I will not be a bailiff, I am head-servant, and will remain so, but I will administer that which we agreed on.”The bailiff was willing to give him whatsoever he demanded, but it was of no use, the head-servant said no to everything.Then the bailiff did not know what to do, and begged for a fortnight’s delay, for he wanted to find some way of escape.The head-servant consented to this delay.The bailiff summoned all his clerks together, and they were to think the matter over, and give him advice.The clerks pondered for a long time, but at last they said that no one was sure of his life with the head-servant, for he could kill a man as easily as a midge, and that the bailiff ought to make him get into the well and clean it, and when he was down below, they would roll up one of the mill-stones which was lying there, and throw it on his head; and then he would never return to daylight.The advice pleased the bailiff, and the head-servant was quite willing to go down the well.When he was standing down below at the bottom, they rolled down the largest mill-stone and thought they had broken his skull, but he cried, “Chase away those hens from the well, they are scratching in the sand up there, and throwing the grains into my eyes, so that I can’t see.”So the bailiff cried, “Sh—sh,” and pretended to frighten the hens away.When the head-servant had finished his work, he climbed up and said, “Just look what a beautiful neck-tie I have on,” and behold it was the mill-stone which he was wearing round his neck.The head-servant now wanted to take his reward, but the bailiff again begged for a fortnight’s delay.The clerks met together and advised him to send the head-servant to the haunted mill to grind corn by night, for from thence as yet no man had ever returned in the morning alive.The proposal pleased the bailiff, he called the head-servant that very evening, and ordered him to take eight bushels of corn to the mill, and grind it that night, for it was wanted.So the head-servant went to the loft, and put two bushels in his right pocket, and two in his left, and took four in a wallet, half on his back, and half on his breast, and thus laden went to the haunted mill.The miller told him that he could grind there very well by day, but not by night, for the mill was haunted, and that up to the present time whosoever had gone into it at night had been found in the morning lying dead inside.He said, “I will manage it, just you go away to bed.”Then he went into the mill, and poured out the corn.About eleven o’clock he went into the miller’s room, and sat down on the bench.When he had sat there a while, a door suddenly opened, and a large table came in, and on the table, wine and roasted meats placed themselves, and much good food besides, but everything came of itself, for no one was there to carry it.After this the chairs pushed themselves up, but no people came, until all at once he beheld fingers, which handled knives and forks, and laid food on the plates, but with this exception he saw nothing.As he was hungry, and saw the food, he, too, place himself at the table, ate with those who were eating and enjoyed it.When he had had enough, and the others also had quite emptied their dishes, he distinctly heard all the candles being suddenly snuffed out, and as it was now pitch dark, he felt something like a box on the ear.Then he said, “If anything of that kind comes again, I shall strike out in return.”And when he had received a second box on the ear, he, too struck out.And so it continued the whole night.He took nothing without returning it, but repaid everything with interest, and did not lay about him in vain.At daybreak, however, everything ceased.When the miller had got up, he wanted to look after him, and wondered if he were still alive.Then the youth said, “I have eaten my fill, have received some boxes on the ears, but I have given some in return.”The miller rejoiced, and said that the mill was now released from the spell, and wanted to give him much money as a reward.But he said, “Money, I will not have, I have enough of it.”So he took his meal on his back, went home, and told the bailiff that he had done what he had been told to do, and would now have the reward agreed on.When the bailiff heard that, he was seriously alarmed and quite beside himself; he walked backwards and forwards in the room, and drops of perspiration ran down from his forehead.Then he opened the window to get some fresh air, but before he was aware, the head-servant had given him such a kick that he flew through the window out into the air, and so far away that no one ever saw him again.Then said the head-servant to the bailiff’s wife, “If he does not come back, you must take the other blow.”She cried, “No, no I cannot bear it,” and opened the other window, because drops of perspiration were running down her forehead.Then he gave her such a kick that she, too, flew out, and as she was lighter she went much higher than her husband.Her husband cried, “Do come to me,” but she replied, “Come thou to me, I cannot come to thee.”And they hovered about there in the air, and could not get to each other, and whether they are still hovering about, or not, I do not know, but the young giant took up his iron bar, and went on his way.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从前有个农夫，拿着他喜爱的榛木拐杖从房子里走出来，对他妻子说：“特莉涅，我要去城里一趟，三天后再回来。这段时间，可能会有牲口贩子来我们家买那三头母牛，你可以卖掉，但必须拿到200泰勒，少一分也不行，听明白了吗？”“看在上帝的份儿上，你安心地去吧，”他的妻子回答说，“我会按照你的吩咐做的。”“你必须这样做。”农夫说。“你小时候把头摔坏了，直到现在还受影响，我可告诉你，如果你做了什么蠢事，我就会用我手中的这根拐杖狠抽你的后背，淤青一年时间都好不了，我说到做到，你可给我记好了。”说完这些，农夫便上路了。第二天，牲口贩子来了，他妻子没费很多口舌就和牲口贩子谈好了买卖。那个牲口贩子看了看牛，听完报价后，说：“我非常乐意付这个价钱，说实在的，它们确实值这个价钱。我要马上带走这几头牲畜。”牲口贩子把牛从牛栏里放了出来，赶着牛往外走。正要出院子时，女人抓住他的袖子说：“你现在必须给我200泰勒，否则，我不会让你把牛牵走的。”“当然，”牲口贩子回答说，“可是我忘带钱袋了。但是，不用担心，我会留下担保的。我带走两头牛，留下一头牛给你作为抵押。”女人听了觉得合情合理，就让牲口贩子把牛牵走了，心里还想：“汉斯回家后看到我如此聪明地做成了买卖，会多高兴啊！”正如农夫说的，他第三天回到了家中，便立即问牛是不是卖了。“是的，确实卖了，亲爱的汉斯，”他妻子回答说，“按照你的吩咐，卖了200泰勒。那些牛也值不了这么多钱，没想到那个人一口答应了，没有讨价还价。”“那银币呢？”汉斯问。“哦，他还没有给我钱，”他的妻子回答说，“他碰巧忘带钱袋了，但他很快就会送来的，他还给我留下了担保。”“他留下了什么担保？”汉斯问道。“是其中一头牛，只有他付了另外两头牛的银币之后，我才会把这头牛给他。我考虑得很周到，留下了三头牛中最小的那头，它吃得最少了。”汉斯听后非常生气，举起拐杖就要打她，正如他之前说过的那样。突然间，他放下拐杖，说道：“你是世界上最傻的人，我觉得你很让人怜悯。我到马路上坐三天，看看能不能遇到比你还笨的人。如果遇到了，那你就不用挨打了。如果没遇到，你就会得到你应该得到的，没得商量。”于是，农夫来到马路上，在一块石头上坐了下来，看看会遇到什么样的人。过了一段时间，他看见一辆农夫的牛车正往他的方向赶来。车上有一个妇人，她既没有坐在身旁的草垛上，也没有赶着车走，而是站在车子的正中央。汉斯心想：“这肯定就是我要找的人。”然后他忽地跳起来，在四轮车前跑来跑去，像个神经病似的。“嗨，你在做什么呢？”妇人问他，“我从没有见过你，你是从哪儿来的啊？”“我是从天堂上掉下来的，”他回答说，“但是不知道该怎么回到天堂里，你能载我一程吗？”“不可以，”妇人回答说，“我不认识路。如果你来自天堂，那请告诉我我丈夫在那里过得怎么样，他三年前就去了天堂。你应当见过他吧？”“哦，对，我见过他。但不是每一个人在天堂都过得很好。他在天堂放羊，那群羊给他添了许多麻烦。它们在山上乱跑，还总是迷路，你丈夫不得不追着羊跑，好把它们赶到一起。他的衣服都被撕成了碎片，就要从身上掉下来了。天堂没有裁缝，圣彼得不允许任何裁缝进去，你知道这个故事的。”“谁会想得到啊！”妇人哭了起来，“我来告诉你，我会去取他那件只有做礼拜才穿的衣服，现在还挂在衣柜里，他穿上那件衣服就会体面多了。麻烦你帮我带给他吧。”“这可行不通，”他回答说，“天堂不允许带着衣物进去，在大门口时衣物就会被没收。”“那辛苦你，”妇人说，“我昨天刚刚卖了些小麦，赚了一些钱，我想把钱给他送去。你把钱袋藏在口袋里，就没人发现了。”“如果你没有其他办法，”汉斯说，“那我就帮帮你吧。”“你先在这里坐着，”妇人说，“我回家去取钱，很快就会回来。我之所以不坐在草垛上，而是站在车中间，是因为这样牛拉起车来就会轻一点。”妇人赶着牛车走了，汉斯想：“这个人真是个大傻子。如果她真把钱取来，我妻子便会认为她自己走运了，因为她不用挨揍了。”没过多久，那个妇人就急匆匆地拿着钱回来了，还亲手把钱放进汉斯的口袋里。她离开之前，还不停地向汉斯道谢。妇人再次回到家中时，她儿子也已经从田里回来了。她告诉儿子，在她身上发生了一件不可思议的事情，还说：“我非常高兴能有一个机会给你可怜的父亲送点东西。谁能想到你父亲在天堂里过得如此窘迫？”她儿子很惊讶。“母亲，”他说道，“并不是每天都有人从天堂这样下来，我必须立刻去找他，看看他还在不在。他得告诉我天堂是什么样子，以及他是怎么工作的。”他骑上马，以最快的速度飞奔而去。他看见了坐在柳树下的农夫，这时农夫正要数钱袋里的钱。“你看见过一个来自天堂的人吗？”年轻人问农夫。“是的，”农夫回答道，“他在回天堂的路上，已经爬过那座山了，那里离天堂已经很近了。如果你快点，说不定能赶上他。”“哎呀，”年轻人说道，“我已经劳作了一整天，赶路已让我精疲力尽。你认识那个人，那就请你骑上我的马去追赶他，劝他回到这里来。”“哈哈！”汉斯想，“又来了一个笨蛋！”“这忙我怎么能不帮呢？”汉斯说。于是他骑上马，扬长而去。那个年轻人一直坐在那儿等着，天都黑了，农夫还没有回来。“那个来自天堂的人一定很匆忙，不肯回来，”年轻人心想，“农夫一定会把马给他，让他带给我父亲的。”于是年轻人便回家了，他把这一切告诉了母亲。他说他已经把马给了父亲，这样父亲就不用总是跑来跑去了。“你做得很好，”他母亲说，“你比你父亲年轻，可以步行。”农夫回到家，把马安置在作为抵押品的母牛旁边，然后对妻子说：“特莉涅，你非常走运，因为我发现了两个比你还笨的人，你不用挨打了。留着下次挨打吧。”于是，农夫点上烟斗，坐在他祖父的椅子上，说道：“用两只瘦牛交换了一匹好马和一钱袋的钱，这真是一笔好买卖。如果愚蠢可以带来这么多东西，我宁愿以愚蠢为荣。”汉斯是这么想的，但你一定喜欢这些单纯的人们。</td>
		<td class="en">One day a peasant took his good hazel-stick out of the corner and said to his wife, “Trina, I am going across country, and shall not return for three days.If during that time the cattle-dealer should happen to call and want to buy our three cows, you may strike a bargain at once, but not unless you can get two hundred thalers for them; nothing less, do you hear?”“For heaven’s sake just go in peace,” answered the woman, “I will manage that.”“You, indeed,” said the man.“You once fell on your head when you were a little child, and that affects you even now; but let me tell you this, if you do anything foolish, I will make your back black and blue, and not with paint, I assure you, but with the stick which I have in my hand, and the colouring shall last a whole year, you may rely on that.”And having said that, the man went on his way.Next morning the cattle-dealer came, and the woman had no need to say many words to him.When he had seen the cows and heard the price, he said, “I am quite willing to give that, honestly speaking, they are worth it.I will take the beasts away with me at once.”He unfastened their chains and drove them out of the byre, but just as he was going out of the yard-door, the woman clutched him by the sleeve and said, “You must give me the two hundred thalers now, or I cannot let the cows go.”“True,” answered the man, “but I have forgotten to buckle on my money-belt.Have no fear, however, you shall have security for my paying.I will take two cows with me and leave one, and then you will have a good pledge.”The woman saw the force of this, and let the man go away with the cows, and thought to herself, “How pleased Hans will be when he finds how cleverly I have managed it!”The peasant came home on the third day as he had said he would, and at once inquired if the cows were sold.“Yes, indeed, dear Hans,” answered the woman, “and as you said, for two hundred thalers.They are scarcely worth so much, but the man took them without making any objection.”“Where is the money?” asked the peasant.“Oh, I have not got the money,” replied the woman; “he had happened to forget his money-belt, but he will soon bring it, and he left good security behind him.”“What kind of security?” asked the man.“One of the three cows, which he shall not have until he has paid for the other two.I have managed very cunningly, for I have kept the smallest, which eats the least.”The man was enraged and lifted up his stick, and was just going to give her the beating he had promised her.Suddenly he let the stick fail and said, “You are the stupidest goose that ever waddled on God’s earth, but I am sorry for you.I will go out into the highways and wait for three days to see if I find anyone who is still stupider than you.If I succeed in doing so, you shall go scot-free, but if I do not find him, you shall receive your well-deserved reward without any discount.”He went out into the great highways, sat down on a stone, and waited for what would happen.Then he saw a peasant’s waggon coming towards him, and a woman was standing upright in the middle of it, instead of sitting on the bundle of straw which was lying beside her, or walking near the oxen and leading them.The man thought to himself, “That is certainly one of the kind I am in search of,” and jumped up and ran backwards and forwards in front of the waggon like one who is not very wise.“What do you want, my friend?” said the woman to him; “I don’t know you, where do you come from?”“I have fallen down from heaven,” replied the man, “and don’t know how to get back again, couldn’t you drive me up?”“No,” said the woman, “I don’t know the way, but if you come from heaven you can surely tell me how my husband, who has been there these three years is.You must have seen him?”“Oh, yes, I have seen him, but all men can’t get on well.He keeps sheep, and the sheep give him a great deal to do.They run up the mountains and lose their way in the wilderness, and he has to run after them and drive them together again.His clothes are all torn to pieces too, and will soon fall off his body.There is no tailor there, for Saint Peter won’t let any of them in, as you know by the story.”“Who would have thought it?” cried the woman, “I tell you what, I will fetch his Sunday coat which is still hanging at home in the cupboard, he can wear that and look respectable.You will be so kind as to take it with you.”“That won’t do very well,” answered the peasant; “people are not allowed to take clothes into Heaven, they are taken away from one at the gate.”“Then hark you,” said the woman, “I sold my fine wheat yesterday and got a good lot of money for it, I will send that to him.If you hide the purse in your pocket, no one will know that you have it.”“If you can’t manage it any other way,” said the peasant, “I will do you that favor.”“Just sit still where you are,” said she, “and I will drive home and fetch the purse, I shall soon be back again.I do not sit down on the bundle of straw, but stand up in the waggon, because it makes it lighter for the cattle.”She drove her oxen away, and the peasant thought, “That woman has a perfect talent for folly, if she really brings the money, my wife may think herself fortunate, for she will get no beating.”It was not long before she came in a great hurry with the money, and with her own hands put it in his pocket.Before she went away, she thanked him again a thousand times for his courtesy.When the woman got home again, she found her son who had come in from the field.She told him what unlooked-for things had befallen her, and then added, “I am truly delighted at having found an opportunity of sending something to my poor husband.Who would ever have imagined that he could be suffering for want of anything up in heaven?”The son was full of astonishment.“Mother,” said he, “it is not every day that a man comes from Heaven in this way, I will go out immediately, and see if he is still to be found; he must tell me what it is like up there, and how the work is done.”He saddled the horse and rode off with all speed.He found the peasant who was sitting under a willow-tree, and was just going to count the money in the purse.“Have you seen the man who has fallen down from Heaven?” cried the youth to him.“Yes,” answered the peasant, “he has set out on his way back there, and has gone up that hill, from whence it will be rather nearer; you could still catch him up, if you were to ride fast.”“Alas,” said the youth, “I have been doing tiring work all day, and the ride here has completely worn me out; you know the man, be so kind as to get on my horse, and go and persuade him to come here.”“Aha!” thought the peasant, “here is another who has no wick in his lamp!”“Why should I not do you this favor?” said he, and mounted the horse and rode off in a quick trot.The youth remained sitting there till night fell, but the peasant never came back.“The man from Heaven must certainly have been in a great hurry, and would not turn back,” thought he, “and the peasant has no doubt given him the horse to take to my father.”He went home and told his mother what had happened, and that he had sent his father the horse so that he might not have to be always running about.“Thou hast done well,” answered she, “thy legs are younger than his, and thou canst go on foot.”When the peasant got home, he put the horse in the stable beside the cow which he had as a pledge, and then went to his wife and said, “Trina, as your luck would have it, I have found two who are still sillier fools than you; this time you escape without a beating, I will store it up for another occasion.”Then he lighted his pipe, sat down in his grandfather’s chair, and said, “It was a good stroke of business to get a sleek horse and a great purse full of money into the bargain, for two lean cows.If stupidity always brought in as much as that, I would be quite willing to hold it in honor.”So thought the peasant, but you no doubt prefer the simple folks.</td></tr>
