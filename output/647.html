		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对于歇洛克·福尔摩斯来说，她始终都是“那位女士”。提到她的时候，我很少听到他使用其他的任何称谓。在福尔摩斯眼里，她是她那个性别之中的翘楚，令其他所有的女人黯然失色。这倒不是说，他对艾琳·阿德勒产生了什么类似于恋慕的情感，因为所有情感，尤其是前面所说的那一种，都与他那冷静精密、稳定至极的头脑格格不入。按我看，他堪称是有史以来最为完美的一部演绎-观察机器，要扮演情人的角色却未免会落入画虎类犬的境地。他从来不会提及那些温柔软弱的情感，即便提及也必然带上挖苦与讽刺。作为一名观察专家，这些情感是十分绝妙的观察对象，非常适合用来揭开人们身上的面纱，由此洞烛他们的动机与行为。然而，作为一名训练有素的演绎专家，若是容许此类情感侵袭自己灵敏缜密、调校精准的心智，那就无异于纵容干扰因素破坏自己的智力成果，使之面临全部失真的危险。他这样的头脑若是产生了剧烈的波动，由此而来的干扰不啻于一台精密的仪器进了沙子，或是他本人拥有的某块高倍透镜有了裂纹。尽管如此，还是有一个女人，也只有一个女人，在他心里留下了暧昧可疑的回忆，这个女人，就是已故的艾琳·阿德勒。</td>
		<td class="en">To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akinto love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >最近我很少见到福尔摩斯。自从我结了婚，我俩之间的交道就少了起来。我过着一种堪称完美的幸福生活，同时又像所有初次成为一家之主的男人一样，一切以家里的事情为中心，这样一来，我自然没有多余的心思去关注其他事情。反过来，福尔摩斯却是个不折不扣的波希米亚人，形形色色的社会规范都让他厌憎不已。他继续住在我们先前居住的贝克街寓所里，一头扎在他那些古旧书籍之中，这一个星期在可卡因的作用之下昏昏欲睡，下一个星期又雄心万丈，爆发出警醒天性带来的蓬勃活力，如此交替，周而复始。跟往常一样，他仍然痴迷于研究罪案，仍然在尽情施展他不可思议的本领和非同凡响的观察力，追踪那些令警方无从下手的线索，破解那些令警方山穷水尽的谜题。隔三岔五，我也会听到一些关于他事迹的模糊记述，听说他应邀去敖德萨处理特里波夫谋杀案，又听说他侦破了亭可马里[^2]阿特金森兄弟的那桩怪异惨案，最后还听说他完成了荷兰皇家的一件委托，手法极其巧妙，结果也十分圆满。不过，他这些动向我都是从报纸上看来的，跟其他的报纸读者没什么两样，除此之外，关于这位老朋友加老室友的近况，我也是所知无几。</td>
		<td class="en">I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.the fierce energy of his own keen nature.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天晚上，那一天是一八八八年三月二十日，我走在出诊归家的路上（当时我已经脱下军装，重操民间医生的旧业），无意中来到了贝克街。我永远都无法忘记那座旧日的寓所，那里有我的求爱历程[^3]，也有《暗红习作》当中记述的种种可怕事件。这样一来，从那道无比熟悉的大门旁边经过的时候，我突然产生了一股强烈的冲动，想去看一看福尔摩斯，去听一听他正在以怎样的方式运用他那些非凡的本领。他的房间里灯火辉煌，我抬头看的时候，刚好就看见他颀长瘦削的黢黑剪影接连两次映在了百叶窗帘上。他正在房间里火急火燎地来回走动，脑袋耷在胸前，双手背在背后。我了解他所有的脾性和习惯，他的姿态和举止对我来说自然不是秘密。显而易见，他又一次进入了工作状态，已经把药物催生的醉梦抛在身后，正在急不可耐地寻找某个新问题的答案。于是我拉响门铃，跟着就被人领进了那个我曾经是半个主人的房间。</td>
		<td class="en">One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the *Study in Scarlet*, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的态度算不上热情，当然，他这个人很少有态度热情的时候。不过我觉得，看到我来，他还是很高兴的。他没有说什么，只是亲切地看着我，摆手示意我到一把扶手椅上去坐，跟着就把他的雪茄盒子扔了过来，又指了指角落里的一只酒樽和一个苏打水瓶[^4]。接下来，他站在壁炉跟前，摆出他那种若有所思的特有神态，上上下下地打量着我。</td>
		<td class="en">His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“婚姻生活很适合你啊，”他说道。“按我看，华生，跟上次见面的时候相比，你的体重增加了七磅半[^5]。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“七磅！”我答道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Seven!” I answered.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是吗，我觉得应该不止。要我说，华生，应该比七磅多那么一点点。我还发现，你又开始行医了。重操旧业的打算，你以前可没跟我提过啊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那么，你到底是怎么知道的呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Then, how do you know?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我观察出来的，演绎出来的。不通过这些方法，我又怎么能知道你最近刚把自己浇了个透心凉、而且请了个特别笨拙又特别马虎的女仆呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“亲爱的福尔摩斯，”我说道，“这可真是有点儿过头了。早生几个世纪的话，你一定会被人烧死的。[^6]确实，周四我在乡间的道路上走了一阵，回家的时候已经被淋得一塌糊涂，可我还是不明白你是怎么知道的，因为我已经换了衣服。至于玛丽·简嘛，她真是没法治，我妻子已经下了逐客令，不过，跟淋雨的事情一样，我想不出你是怎么知道的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice; but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他吃吃地笑了起来，兴奋地搓了搓他那双纤长的手。</td>
		<td class="en">He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“再简单不过了，”他说道，“我的眼睛告诉我，你左脚鞋子的内侧，映着炉火的那个地方，皮子上有六道几乎平行的划痕，划痕的来由显然是某个人替你刮沾在鞋底边缘的泥巴，而且非常地不小心。这样一来，我就同时得出了两个推论，一个是你曾经在天气糟糕的时候出过门，另一个则是，你正在向我展示一个伦敦女仆毁坏靴子的恶劣实例。至于行医的事情嘛，既然眼前的这位先生带着一股碘仿气味走进我的房间，右手食指上有一个硝酸银染污的黑渍，礼帽右侧又有一个被帽子里的听诊器[^7]撑出来的鼓包，那么，说实在的，我要是还不能断定他是医疗行业的一位活跃成员的话，脑子就多少有点儿迟钝了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >看到他轻松随意地解释自己的演绎过程，我不由得笑了起来。“听完你的解释之后，”我说道，“我总是觉得事情简单得让人难以置信，连我自个儿也可以轻而易举地推测出来，可是，面对你接连不断的一个个推论，我又总是要等你解释之后才能明白其中的缘由。话说回来，按我看，我的眼力并不比你差啊。”</td>
		<td class="en">I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked, “the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“确实如此，”他一边回答，一边点起一支雪茄，身子一歪，倒进了一把扶手椅。“可你只是在看，并不是在观察，两者之间的区别十分明显。举例来说，你肯定经常看见从门厅到我房间的这段楼梯吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“经常看见。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Frequently."</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“有多经常呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“How often?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“呃，几百次总有了吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, some hundreds of times.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那么，楼梯一共有多少级呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Then how many are there?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“多少级？我不知道。”</td>
		<td class="en">“How many? I don’t know.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这就对了！因为你没有观察，尽管你的确是看了。我要说的就是这个意思。好了，我知道楼梯有十七级，因为我不光看了，而且还进行了观察。对了，既然你对这些小问题有兴趣，还好心好意地把我的一两件微末事迹写了出来，那你多半也会对这个有兴趣。”桌子上摊着一张厚厚的粉色便笺纸，这会儿他就把它拿了起来，扔到了我的面前。“这是上一班邮差送来的，”他说道。“把它念出来吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >便笺上没有日期，也没有落款和地址，内容如下：</td>
		<td class="en">The note was undated, and without either signature or address.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >> “今晚七时三刻，某君将登门拜访，有干系至为重大之要事相询。欧洲某王室近日曾得尊驾襄助，足证尊驾精诚可赖，堪以紧要程度言所难尽之重事相托。此处所言足下风评，我等已自各方收悉。所订之时，望勿外出，来客若施面具，万望海涵。</td>
		<td class="en">> “There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock [it said], a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这可真是挺神秘的，”我说道，“你怎么看呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it means?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“手头还没有资料啊。最要不得的事情就是在拿到资料之前进行假设。那样的话，不知不觉之中，你就会扭曲事实来适应自己的假设，而不是设法让假设去适应事实。话说回来，这张便条本身就是资料。你从里面看出了些什么呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我仔仔细细地检查了一下便笺的字迹，还有便笺所用的纸张。</td>
		<td class="en">I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“写便条的人应该是相当富裕，”我尽心尽力地模仿着我同伴的演绎方法。“这样的纸至少也得半个克朗[^8]一扎。还有，这张纸特别结实、特别挺括。 ”</td>
		<td class="en">“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“特别——你这个词用得非常恰当，”福尔摩斯说道。“这张纸压根儿就不是英国产的。你把它举到灯光下去看看吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我依言行事，于是就发现，纸张的纹理当中藏着三组字母，挨在一起的一个大“E”和一个小“g”、一个单独的“P”，以及挨在一起的一个大“G”和一个小“t”。</td>
		<td class="en">I did so, and saw a large “*E*” with a small “*g*”, a “*P*,” and a large “*G*” with a small “*t*” woven into the texture of the paper.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“按你看，这是什么意思呢？”福尔摩斯问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“毫无疑问，这是制造者的名字。不对，应该说是他名字的缩写标记更恰当。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“完全不对。挨在一起的这个大‘G’和小‘t’表示‘Gesellschaft’，也就是德文里的‘公司’。这是一种惯常的缩写，跟咱们用‘Co.’来表示‘公司’一样。‘P’呢，自然是‘纸张’的意思。现在来看看这个‘Eg’。等一等，咱们先来扫一眼这本《欧陆地名词典》。”他把一本沉甸甸的褐色巨帙从书架上拿了下来。“Eglow，Eglonitz——找到了，是Egria。那地方离卡尔斯巴德不远，属于一个讲德语的国家——波希米亚。‘此地为瓦伦斯坦[^9]身亡之处，并以玻璃厂及造纸厂众多闻名。’哈，哈，伙计，你怎么看呢？”他两眼放光，得意洋洋地喷了一大口蓝色的雪茄烟雾。</td>
		<td class="en">“Not at all. The ‘*G*’ with the small ‘*t*’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’ which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like our ‘Co.’ ‘*P*,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘*Eg*.’ Let us glance at our *Continental Gazetteer*.” He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这张纸是波希米亚的产品，”我说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“完全正确。还有，写信的是个讲德语的人。你注意到这句话的古怪结构没有——‘此处所言足下风评，我等已自各方收悉。’法国人和俄国人都不会这么写，只有讲德语的人才这么不待见自个儿的动词[^10]。因此，有待查明的是，这个讲德语、用波希米亚纸写信、愿意戴面具不愿意露脸的人究竟有什么样的企图。听，如果我没搞错的话，这会儿他已经到了，咱们所有的疑问马上就会得到解答。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence— ‘This account of you we have fromall quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他话音未落，外面就传来了一阵清脆的马蹄声，然后是车轮贴到路边的轧轧声，再下来就是有人猛拉门铃的声音。福尔摩斯吹了声口哨。</td>

		<td class="en">“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of the window. “ A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.</td></tr>

At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man.

And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster.

		<td class="en">“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait.

Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.</td></tr>
