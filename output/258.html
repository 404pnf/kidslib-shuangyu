		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >陶屋是幢丑陋的方方正正的砖房，四周围着墙。围墙把整个陶器作坊的所有场院也都围了起来。当然，有一道女贞树的树篱将陶屋及其小院围住，与陶器作坊的场院和工厂隔开了，但也只是部分隔开而已。穿过树篱，可以看到已荒废的场院，以及有着很多窗户、像工厂模样的陶器作坊。从树篱上看，可以看到一座座的烟囱和附属的小房子。但在树篱墙内，怡人的花园和草地顺坡而下，延伸至一个边上长有柳树的水塘。这水塘曾经为工厂提供水源。</td>
		<td class="en">The Pottery House was a square, ugly, brick house girt in by the wall that enclosed the whole grounds of the pottery itself.To be sure, a privet hedge partly masked the house and its ground from the pottery-yard and works: but only partly.Through the hedge could be seen the desolate yard, and the many-windowed, factory-like pottery, over the hedge could be seen the chimneys and the outhouses.But inside the hedge, a pleasant garden and lawn sloped down to a willow pool, which had once supplied the works.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >陶器作坊现已停工，场院的大门也长期关闭着。再也没有有黄色稻草露在外面的巨大板条箱成堆地堆在包装棚旁了。再也没有高头大马拉着满载货物的大车沿山坡而下了。再也看不到那些穿着黏土色工作服、脸上和头发上溅满了小块灰色泥巴的制陶少女，看不到她们和男人们嬉戏、大声尖叫的情景了。一切都消逝了。</td>
		<td class="en">The Pottery itself was now closed, the great doors of the yard permanently shut.No more the great crates with yellow straw showing through, stood in stacks by the packing shed.No more the drays drawn by great horses rolled down the hill with a high load.No more the pottery-lasses in their clay-coloured overalls, their faces and hair splashed with grey fine mud, shrieked and larked with the men.All that was over.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们更想——嗯，更想——安静点儿。”马狄尔达·罗克利说道。</td>
		<td class="en">‘We like it much better—oh, much better—quieter,’ said Matilda Rockley.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗯，是的。”她的妹妹埃米·罗克利附和道。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Oh, yes,’ assented Emmie Rockley, her sister.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我相信你们是这样想的。”来客也附和着说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I’m sure you do,’ agreed the visitor.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但这两个罗克利家的姑娘是真的这样想，还是她们只是想象她们更喜欢安静一点，那就不得而知了。当灰色的黏土不再溅得到处都是污泥，也不再把淤泥淤塞在房上，她们的生活的确变得更灰暗、更枯燥了。如今，她们还没有完全意识到自己是多么想念那些女孩们，那些她们曾经极为熟悉、同时也极为讨厌的、不停尖叫和吵闹的制陶少女们。</td>
		<td class="en">But whether the two Rockley girls really liked it better, or whether they only imagined they did, is a question.Certainly their lives were much more grey and dreary now that the grey clay had ceased to spatter its mud and silt its dust over the premises.They did not quite realize how they missed the shrieking, shouting lasses, whom they had known all their lives and disliked so much.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >马狄尔达和埃米都是老姑娘了。在一个完全工业化的地区，对于期望值超过普通人的姑娘来说，找个丈夫并不容易。这座难看的工业城镇里到处都是男人，且都是已到适婚年龄的年轻男人。但他们不是矿工就是陶工，都只是工人而已。罗克利家的姑娘们在她们父亲去世后每人可得到大约1万英镑：价值1万英镑、可获利的房产。这可不是区区小数：她们非常沉着镇定，克制着不让这笔财富轻易落入任何一个普通的无产者的囊中。结果，银行职员或是新教牧师，甚至学校教师都没能脱颖而出。马狄尔达已经开始对离开陶屋不抱有任何想法了。</td>
		<td class="en">Matilda and Emmie were already old maids.In a thorough industrial district, it is not easy for the girls who have expectations above the common to find husbands.The ugly industrial town was full of men, young men who were ready to marry.But they were all colliers or pottery-hands, mere workmen.The Rockley girls would have about ten thousand pounds each when their father died: ten thousand pounds’ worth of profitable house-property.It was not to be sneezed at: they felt so themselves, and refrained from sneezing away such a fortune on any mere member of the proletariat.Consequently, bank-clerks or nonconformist clergymen or even school-teachers having failed to come forward, Matilda had begun to give up all idea of ever leaving the Pottery House.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >马狄尔达是个身材高挑、苗条，举止优雅的漂亮女孩，只是鼻子很大。如果说埃米是马大，那么马狄尔达就是马利亚，也就是说，马狄尔达喜欢绘画和音乐，读过很多小说，而埃米则负责操持家务。埃米比姐姐矮一些、壮一些，没有什么才艺。她很尊敬姐姐马狄尔达，因为姐姐天生端庄优雅、明白事理。</td>
		<td class="en">Matilda was a tall, thin, graceful fair girl, with a rather large nose.She was the Mary to Emmie’s Martha: that is, Matilda loved painting and music, and read a good many novels, whilst Emmie looked after the house-keeping.Emmie was shorter, plumper than her sister, and she had no accomplishments.She looked up to Matilda, whose mind was naturally refined and sensible.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两个姑娘平静而郁郁寡欢地生活着，倒也过得心满意足。她们的母亲过世了。父亲也病了。父亲是个精明的人，以前受过一些教育，但他更愿意把自己当成劳动人民中的一员。他热爱音乐，小提琴拉得很好。但现在他日益衰老，病得很重，肾病将他折磨得奄奄一息。他曾经喝威士忌喝得很凶。</td>
		<td class="en">In their quiet, melancholy way, the two girls were happy.Their mother was dead.Their father was ill also.He was an intelligent man who had had some education, but preferred to remain as if he were one with the rest of the working people.He had a passion for music and played the violin pretty well.But now he was getting old, he was very ill, dying of a kidney disease.He had been rather a heavy whisky-drinker.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个平静的家庭还雇了一个女佣，一家人年复一年地生活在陶屋里。朋友们来访时，姑娘们便出去，父亲则更放肆地酗酒，病得越来越严重。外面的街道上，矿工们的喧嚣声、狗吠声、孩子们的哭闹声不绝于耳。但在陶器作坊的墙内却如同荒芜之地一般冷冷清清。</td>
		<td class="en">This quiet household, with one servant-maid, lived on year after year in the Pottery House.Friends came in, the girls went out, the father drank himself more and more ill.Outside in the street there was a continual racket of the colliers and their dogs and children.But inside the pottery wall was a deserted quiet.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个家有一点美中不足之处。姑娘们的父亲特德·罗克利先生有四个女儿，却没有儿子。随着女儿们长大成人，他发现自己在家总是被女人们包围着，感觉十分恼火。于是他去伦敦一个福利机构领养了一个男孩。当父亲领着他的小神童——这个叫哈德里安的6岁男孩——回到家时，埃米14岁，马狄尔达16岁了。</td>
		<td class="en">In all this ointment there was one little fly.Ted Rockley, the father of the girls, had had four daughters, and no son.As his girls grew, he felt angry at finding himself always in a house-hold of women.He went off to London and adopted a boy out of a Charity Institution.Emmie was fourteen years old, and Matilda sixteen, when their father arrived home with his prodigy, the boy of six, Hadrian.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >哈德里安是来自福利院的一个普通男孩，一头普普通通的棕色头发，一双普普通通的浅蓝色眼睛，连浓浓的伦敦腔也是普普通通的。罗克利家的姑娘们——他到来时还有三个没出嫁——对他的突然出现有些怨恨。他凭借着在福利机构培养的警觉性，马上意识到了这一点。他虽然只有6岁，但当他看着这三个年轻女人时，脸上总是带着一丝难以察觉的、嘲弄的神情。她们坚持让他叫表姐：弗洛拉表姐，马狄尔达表姐，埃米表姐。他照做了，但腔调里似乎总带着一丝嘲弄。</td>
		<td class="en">Hadrian was just an ordinary boy from a Charity Home, with ordinary brownish hair and ordinary bluish eyes and of ordinary rather cockney speech.The Rockley girls—there were three at home at the time of his arrival—had resented his being sprung on them.He, with his watchful, charity-institution instinct, knew this at once.Though he was only six years old, Hadrian had a subtle, jeering look on his face when he regarded the three young women.They insisted he should address them as Cousin: Cousin Flora, Cousin Matilda, Cousin Emmie.He complied, but there seemed a mockery in his tone.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是，姑娘们本性还是善良的。弗洛拉嫁人离开了家。虽然她们有些严厉，但哈德里却总是按照自己的意愿对待马狄尔达和埃米。他在陶屋里、陶屋的房前屋后渐渐长大了。他上了小学，人们都叫他哈德里安·罗克利。他对待马狄尔达表姐和埃米表姐有点冷淡、说话言简意赅；他行事一贯低调、少言寡语。姑娘们叫他小滑头，但他不是那样的人。他只是很谨慎，不够直率。他的叔叔特德·罗克利和他有着心照不宣的默契，因为他们的性情有些相似。哈德里安和这位上了年纪的男人彼此间互相尊重，但缺乏感情。</td>
		<td class="en">The girls, however, were kind-hearted by nature.Flora married and left home.Hadrian did very much as he pleased with Matilda and Emmie, though they had certain strictnesses.He grew up in the Pottery House and about the Pottery premises, went to an elementary school, and was invariably called Hadrian Rockley.He regarded Cousin Matilda and Cousin Emmie with a certain laconic indifference, was quiet and reticent in his ways.The girls called him sly, but that was unjust.He was merely cautious, and without frankness.His Uncle, Ted Rockley, understood him tacitly, their natures were somewhat akin.Hadrian and the elderly man had a real but unemotional regard for one another.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这男孩13岁时被送到了县城里的一所中学去。他并不喜欢。马狄尔达表姐希望把他塑造成一个小绅士，但遭到了他的拒绝。当别人强制性地调教他成为一个温文尔雅的人时，他会略带轻蔑地撇一下嘴，然后带着福利院儿童特有的羞涩，咧嘴一笑。他在中学时经常逃学，把书籍、带着校徽的帽子，甚至自己的围巾和手帕卖给同学，然后带着钱不知道跑到哪儿鬼混去了。所以那两年他过得很不愉快。</td>
		<td class="en">When he was thirteen years old the boy was sent to a High School in the County town.He did not like it.His Cousin Matilda had longed to make a little gentleman of him, but he refused to be made.He would give a little contemptuous curve to his lip, and take on a shy, charity-boy grin, when refinement was thrust upon him.He played truant from the High School, sold his books, his cap with its badge, even his very scarf and pocket-handkerchief, to his school-fellows, and went raking off heaven knows where with the money.So he spent two very unsatisfactory years.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >15岁时，他宣布他要离开英格兰去殖民地。他一直和福利院保持着联系。罗克利一家知道，当哈德里安以他平静、半嘲弄的方式宣布什么时，反对他一点都没用，甚至会适得其反。所以最后他在他曾呆过的福利院的护送下去了加拿大，离开了这个家。他对罗克利一家一句感谢的话都没说就道别走了，似乎没有一丝痛苦。马狄尔达和埃米想到他离开家的情景常常落泪：甚至她们父亲的脸上也会浮现一丝古怪的神情。但哈德里安会经常从加拿大写信回来。他已经进了蒙特利尔附近的某个电厂工作，而且干得不错。</td>
		<td class="en">When he was fifteen he announced that he wanted to leave England and go to the Colonies.He had kept touch with the Home.The Rockleys knew that, when Hadrian made a declaration, in his quiet, half-jeering manner, it was worse than useless to oppose him.So at last the boy departed, going to Canada under the protection of the Institution to which he had belonged.He said good-bye to the Rockleys without a word of thanks, and parted, it seemed, without a pang.Matilda and Emmie wept often to think of how he left them: even on their father’s face a queer look came.But Hadrian wrote fairly regularly from Canada.He had entered some electricity works near Montreal, and was doing well.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但后来，战争爆发了。接着，哈德里安应召入伍，来到了欧洲。罗克利家的人连他的影子都没看到。他们还住在陶屋里，像往常一样生活。特德·罗克利得了一种浮肿病，奄奄一息。他心里很想见见这个男孩。签署停战协议后，哈德里安放了长假。他写信说打算回家，回陶屋来。</td>
		<td class="en">At last, however, the war came.In his turn, Hadrian joined up and came to Europe.The Rockleys saw nothing of him.They lived on, just the same, in the Pottery House.Ted Rockley was dying of a sort of dropsy, and in his heart he wanted to see the boy.When the armistice was signed, Hadrian had a long leave, and wrote that he was coming home to the Pottery House.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >姑娘们非常焦躁不安。说实话，她们有点怕哈德里安。高高瘦瘦的马狄尔达身体虚弱；两姐妹为照顾父亲已经精疲力尽了。而现在，21岁的哈德里安——那个五年前冷漠地离开他们的年轻人——现在要和他们住在同一幢房子里，实在让人难受。</td>
		<td class="en">The girls were terribly fluttered.To tell the truth, they were a little afraid of Hadrian.Matilda, tall and thin, was frail in her health, both girls were worn with nursing their father.To have Hadrian, a young man of twenty-one, in the house with them, after he had left them so coldly five years before, was a trying circumstance.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她们忐忑不安。埃米最终说服了父亲住到楼下的晨间起居室，而把他在楼上的房间留给哈德里安住。安排好这事后，正当她们还在为他的到来做其他准备的时候，上午十点钟，这个年轻人突然出现在她们面前，相当出人意料。当时，埃米表姐的头发一缕缕地搭在前额上，上下跳动，样子十分可笑，她正忙着擦楼梯毯的压条。而马狄尔达表姐正在厨房用肥皂水洗客厅的装饰品，她细细的胳膊上袖子高高挽起，用抹布包住的头发显得古怪而轻佻。</td>
		<td class="en">They were in a flutter.Emmie persuaded her father to have his bed made finally in the morning-room downstairs, whilst his room upstairs was prepared for Hadrian.This was done, and preparations were going on for the arrival, when, at ten o’clock in the morning the young man suddenly turned up, quite unexpectedly.Cousin Emmie, with her hair bobbed up in absurd little bobs round her forehead, was busily polishing the stair-rods, while Cousin Matilda was in the kitchen washing the drawing-room ornaments in a lather, her sleeves rolled back on her thin arms, and her head tied up oddly and coquettishly in a duster.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当这个沉着冷静的年轻人带着行囊走进来，并把帽子放在缝纫机上时，马狄尔达表姐因羞愧而满脸通红。他个子矮小，但很自信。从他异常整洁的穿着上还能看出他来自福利院。他的脸呈棕色，脸上留了撮小胡子；他虽身材矮小，但却显得精力旺盛。</td>
		<td class="en">Cousin Matilda blushed deep with mortification when the self-possessed young man walked in with his kit-bag, and put his cap on the sewing machine.He was little and self-confident, with a curious neatness about him that still suggested the Charity Institution.His face was brown, he had a small moustache, he was vigorous enough in his smallness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“呀，这不是哈德里安吗！”马狄尔达表姐惊叫道，同时挤掉手上的泡沫。“我们以为你明天才到呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Well, is it Hadrian!’ exclaimed Cousin Matilda, wringing the lather off her hand.‘We didn’t expect you till tomorrow.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我周一晚上下的车。”哈德里安边说边打量着房子。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I got off Monday night,’ said Hadrian, glancing round the room.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“真没想到！”马狄尔达表姐说。然后，她擦干手，走上前，伸出手说：</td>
		<td class="en">‘Fancy!’ said Cousin Matilda.Then, having dried her hands, she went forward, held out her hand, and said:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你好吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘How are you?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“很好，谢谢。”哈德里安说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Quite well, thank you,’ said Hadrian.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你是个男子汉了。”马狄尔达表姐说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘You’re quite a man,’ said Cousin Matilda.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >哈德里安打量了她一眼。她没有表现出最美的一面：太瘦，鼻子太大，还用个粉白相间的方格抹布裹着头。她意识到自己形象不佳。但她已经经历过太多痛苦和悲伤，所以她一点也不在意。</td>
		<td class="en">Hadrian glanced at her.She did not look her best: so thin, so large-nosed, with that pink-and-white checked duster tied round her head.She felt her disadvantage.But she had had a good deal of suffering and sorrow, she did not mind any more.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >仆人走了进来——她并不认识哈德里安。</td>
		<td class="en">The servant entered—one that did not know Hadrian.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“去看看我的父亲吧。”马狄尔达表姐说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Come and see my father,’ said Cousin Matilda.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在大厅里，他们的突然出现使埃米表姐惊得像揭去了掩护物的山鹑。她正在楼梯上把颜色鲜亮的楼梯毯压条推回原位。她用手本能地扶着那些小把手，额前的头发上下摆动。</td>
		<td class="en">In the hall they roused Cousin Emmie like a partridge from cover.She was on the stairs pushing the bright stair-rods into place.Instinctively her hand went to the little knobs, her front hair bobbed on her forehead.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哎呀！”她没好气地喊道，“你怎么今天就来了？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Why!’ she exclaimed, crossly.‘What have you come today for?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我早了一天下车。”哈德里安说。他的男性嗓音如此深沉，让人出人意料，使埃米表姐为之一震。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I got off a day earlier,’ said Hadrian, and his man’s voice so deep and unexpected was like a blow to Cousin Emmie.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哼，你刚才撞见我们忙成一团了。”她恨恨地说。然后，三个人走进了中间的房间。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Well, you’ve caught us in the midst of it,’ she said, with resentment.Then all three went into the middle room.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >罗克利先生已经穿戴整齐——也就是穿上了裤子和袜子——但他正躺在床上休息。床靠在窗户下面，这样他可以透过窗户看到他心爱的姹紫嫣红的花园，那里郁金香和苹果树花团锦簇、绚丽多彩。他看起来并没有实际上病得那么严重，因为他只是身体水肿，脸上气色正常。他的肚子肿胀得很厉害。他迅速瞥了一眼，头都没转，只是转了一下眼睛。他曾经长相英俊、体格健壮，现在却憔悴得只剩下了个躯壳。</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. Rockley was dressed—that is, he had on his trousers and socks—but he was resting on the bed, propped up just under the window, from whence he could see his beloved and resplendent garden, where tulips and apple-trees were ablaze.He did not look as ill as he was, for the water puffed him up, and his face kept its colour.His stomach was much swollen.He glanced round swiftly, turning his eyes without turning his head.He was the wreck of a handsome, well-built man.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >看见哈德里安，他脸上浮现出一丝古怪而勉强的微笑。年轻人温顺地向他问候。</td>
		<td class="en">Seeing Hadrian, a queer, unwilling smile went over his face.The young man greeted him sheepishly.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Matilda went upstairs to change.She had thought it all out how she would receive Hadrian, and impress him.And he had caught her with her head tied up in a duster, and her thin arms in a basin of lather.But she did not care.She now dressed herself most scrupulously, carefully folded her long, beautiful, blonde hair, touched her pallor with a little rouge, and put her long string of exquisite crystal beads over her soft green dress.Now she looked elegant, like a heroine in a magazine illustration, and almost as unreal.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">She found Hadrian and her father talking away.The young man was short of speech as a rule, but he could find his tongue with his ‘uncle’.They were both sipping a glass of brandy, and smoking, and chatting like a pair of old cronies.Hadrian was telling about Canada.He was going back there when his leave was up.</td></tr>
