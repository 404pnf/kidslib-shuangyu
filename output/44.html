		<td class="en">The village Post Office, with its clock and letter-box, its postmistress lost in the heartless seductions of the Aristocracy and tales of coroneted woe, and the sallow-faced grocer watching from his window opposite, is the scene of a daily crisis in my life, when every afternoon I walk there through the country lanes and ask that well-read young lady for my letters. I always expect good news and cheques; and then, of course, there is the magical Fortune which is coming, and word of it may reach me any day. What it is, this strange Felicity, or whence it shall arrive, I have no notion; but I hurry down in the morning to find the news on the breakfast table, open telegrams in delighted panic, and cry “Here it comes!” when in the night-silence I hear wheels approaching along the road. So, happy in the hope of Happiness, and not greatly concerned with any other interest or ambition, I live on in my quiet, ordered house; and so I shall live perhaps until the end. Is it merely the last great summons and revelation for which I am waiting?</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Sitting for hours idle in the shade of an apple tree, near the garden- hives, and under the aerial thoroughfares of those honey-merchants,—sometimes when the noonday heat is loud with their minute industry, or when they fall in crowds out of the late sun to their night-long labours,—I have sought instruction from the Bees, and tried to appropriate to myself the old industrious lesson. </td></tr>

		<td class="en">And yet, hang it all, who by rights should be the teacher and who the learners? For those peevish, over-toiled, utilitarian insects, was there no lesson to be derived from the spectacle of Me? Gazing out at me with myriad eyes from their joyless factories, might they not learn at last—could I not finally teach them—a wiser and more generous-hearted way to improve the shining hours?</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我在田边散步时遇到过牧师先生一两次，他说他很高兴我对农业感兴趣，只是我对小麦的感觉让他不解。</td>
		<td class="en">The Vicar, whom I met once or twice in my walks about the fields, told me that he was glad that I was taking an interest in farming. Only my feeling about wheat, he said, puzzled him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我没能向牧师先生解释清楚，其实这种对小麦的感觉只是一种惊叹而已。树林那边有一片麦田，我亲眼看着那里的庄稼逐渐成熟。有一天我走了进去，那广袤无垠的金色光芒让我目眩神迷。我沐浴在蔚蓝的天空下金灿灿的麦田中；在它面前，橡树林、灌木丛以及英格兰其他所有美景全都黯然失色！我从不记得小麦有如此的光辉；也从没在书中看到过在离太阳如此遥远的国度，竟然会有如此浓烈、蓬勃、无畏的事物，好像这从地缝里喷射出的丰饶的红彤彤的金色是从地表下炙热的大地脉络里喷涌而出一般。我记得几千年来小麦一直是财富的主要形式，著名的城市和王国都囤积了大量的小麦；我想到种植小麦的过程，耕地的白牛、大谷仓、扬谷风扇、还有磨坊，里面有溅着水花的轮子、在风的吹动下缓缓转动的摇杆；我想到收获时节的麦田，日落的余晖中，或一轮弯月下，那一捆捆、一堆堆的小麦。它给北方的景色增添了怎样的美丽，又给南方带去了多少古朴、热情而又圣洁的美景啊！</td>
		<td class="en">Now the feeling in regard to wheat which I had not been able to make clear to the Vicar, was simply one of amazement. Walking one day into a field that I had watched yellowing beyond the trees, I was dazzled by the glow and great expanse of gold. I bathed myself in the intense yellow under the intense blue sky; how it dimmed the oak trees and copses and all the rest of the English landscape! I had not remembered the glory of the Wheat; nor imagined in my reading that in a country so far from the Sun, there could be anything so rich, so prodigal, so reckless, as this opulence of ruddy gold, bursting out from the cracked earth as from some fiery vein beneath. I remembered how for thousands of years Wheat had been the staple of wealth, the hoarded wealth of famous cities and empires; I thought of the processes of corn-growing, the white oxen ploughing, the great barns, the winnowing fans, the mills with the splash of their wheels, or arms slow-turning in the wind; of cornfields at harvest-time, with shocks and sheaves in the glow of sunset, or under the sickle moon; what beauty it brought into the northern landscape, the antique, passionate, Biblical beauty of the South!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >命运的来临</td>
		<td class="en">The Coming Of Fate</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我追寻自己思想的源泉，发现它们始于脆弱易逝的机缘巧合，源于我生命过往中闪耀着奇异光芒的瞬间。左右我在十字路口向左转还是向右转的是小小的冲动，相遇是小小的偶然，第一次将我和我的朋友牵引到一起的是轻如蛛网的细线。一切都充满了神奇；而更神秘的是那些用翅膀触碰到我、与我擦身而过的瞬间：当命运向我招手，我却没有看到，当新生活在门前短暂驻足，我却一无所知；但是话没说出口，手没伸出去，这些可能性一闪即逝，如梦境般模糊不清，终究化为乌有。</td>
		<td class="en">When I seek out the sources of my thoughts, I find they had their beginning in fragile Chance; were born of little moments that shine for me curiously in the past. Slight the impulse that made me take this turning at the cross-roads, trivial and fortuitous the meeting, and light as gossamer the thread that first knit me to my friend. These are full of wonder; more mysterious are the moments that must have brushed me with their wings and passed me by: when Fate beckoned and I did not see it, when new Life trembled for a second on the threshold; but the word was not spoken, the hand was not held out, and the Might-have-been shivered and vanished, dim as a dream, into the waste realms of non-existence.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >所以我从未停止去体会日常生活那反复无常、充满危险的魅力，以及其中的种种邂逅、言谈和意外。也许就在今天，或者下星期，我会听到一个声音，然后就收拾好我的格莱斯顿旅行包，追随它到天涯海角。</td>
		<td class="en">So I never lose a sense of the whimsical and perilous charm of daily life, with its meetings and words and accidents. Why, to-day, perhaps, or next week, I may hear a voice, and, packing up my Gladstone bag, follow it to the ends of the world.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Ladies and Gentlemen,” I began—</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >牧师先生坐在椅子上；拉蒙坦夫人和她的女儿们坐在我们对面；这个小教室的墙上挂着地图和大幅的圣经篇章，黑板上还能看见当天的算术题。大家齐聚一堂，村里的工人们、年迈的马车夫和他的妻子、独眼的邮递员、寄宿学校的园丁和男学生们。我从报纸上摘抄了几句话，写了一篇演讲稿，现在我如此激昂、口若悬河地宣讲出来，震惊了在场的每一个人，甚至把我自己都给震住了。牧师先生大声叫着“听啊，听啊！”他的妻子用伞如此用力敲击着地面，村民们如此衷心地喝彩，让我心里升起一股暖意。我开始感觉到了我自己的话语的意义；我朝听众微笑着，觉得他们都是我的兄弟，都愿共和国拥有美好的未来；我觉得似乎在这里我可以吐露我自己对联邦的真实看法和希望。</td>
		<td class="en">The Vicar was in the chair; Mrs. La Mountain and her daughters sat facing us; and in the little schoolroom, with its maps and large Scripture prints, its blackboard with the day’s sums still visible on it, were assembled the labourers of the village, the old family coachman and his wife, the one-eyed postman, and the gardeners and boys from the Hall. Having culled from the newspapers a few phrases, I had composed a speech which I delivered with a spirit and eloquence surprising even to myself. The Vicar cried “Hear, Hear!” the Vicar’s wife pounded her umbrella with such emphasis, and the villagers cheered so heartily, that my heart was warmed. I began to feel the meaning of my own words; I beamed on the audience, felt that they were all my brothers, all wished well to the Republic; and it seemed to me an occasion to divulge my real ideas and hopes for the Commonwealth.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我忘乎所以了，把安全原则完全抛诸脑后，我开始重塑我们的国家。大多数现有的机构不久即被废止；然后在它们的废墟上，我建立起我心目中的城市那明亮围墙和宫殿—我在柏拉图的书中读到的城市。我带着巨大的热情，以我自以为是的口才，滔滔不绝地把它全部描述出来—那些战士们，那群正值黄金年华的青年们是由国家选中的勇士和美女交欢诞下的；那些精通哲学的卫国者们，身居高位，视野广阔，因此养成了一种惯常的伟大气质，他们的意志无比坚毅，居高临下而对人类的生死漠然处之。然后我宣称这座城市的格局是在天堂里构建好的。听众已所剩无几且一头雾水，在他们的欢呼声中我坐了下来。</td>
		<td class="en">Brushing therefore to one side, and indeed quite forgetting my safe principles, I began to refashion and new-model the State. Most existing institutions were soon abolished; and then, on their ruins, I proceeded to build up the bright walls and palaces of the City within me—the City I had read of in Plato. With enthusiasm, and, I flatter myself, with eloquence, I described it all—the Warriors, that race of golden youth bred from the State-ordered embraces of the brave and fair; those philosophic Guardians, who, being ever accustomed to the highest and most extensive views, and thence contracting an habitual greatness, possessed the truest fortitude, looking down indeed with a kind of disregard on human life and death. And then, declaring that the pattern of this City was laid up in Heaven, I sat down, amid the cheers of the uncomprehending little audience.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在那之后，我在乡间骑马时，曾在那些贴在墙上和谷仓门上的促销广告、对鸟蛋的规定、迁移猪的告示中间，看到有几张经过风吹日晒、看起来破旧不堪的小告示，上面写着我将在会上发言。这时，我就会想起我在那间小教室里搭建起的城市的围墙和塔楼在牧师先生等众人的眼中又是怎样丝毫没有闪耀出天堂般的光芒。</td>
		<td class="en">And afterward, in my rides about the country, when I saw on walls and the doors of barns, among advertisements of sales, or regulations about birds’ eggs or the movements of swine, little weather-beaten, old-looking notices on which it was stated that I would address the meeting, I remembered how the walls and towers of the City I built up in that little schoolroom had shone with no heavenly light in the eyes of the Vicar’s party.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们一直端坐在我心的地平线上，围成一个巨石阵,长辈们带着不赞同表情的脸——叔父辈们的、校长们的、老师们的脸，他们都对着年轻的我皱眉头。</td>
		<td class="en">There they sit for ever around the horizon of my mind, that Stonehenge circle of elderly disapproving Faces—Faces of the Uncles, and Schoolmasters and the Tutors who frowned on my youth.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在巨石阵光明的中央，在阳光下，我蹦跳，我雀跃，我舞蹈；但当我抬起头，却看到他们并没有受骗。从来没什么能够平息他们的怒气，从来没什么能让他们阴郁苍老、充满不屑的脸上露出赞许的表情。</td>
		<td class="en">In the bright centre and sunlight I leap, I caper, I dance my dance; but when I look up, I see they are not deceived. For nothing ever placates them, nothing ever moves to a look of approval that ring of bleak, old, contemptuous Faces.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">My Portrait</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但我毕竟不是一条变形虫，只有一个皮囊和一个胃；我能够交谈、会骑自行车、查列车时刻表；实际上我是、并能够厚着脸皮吹嘘我是人类—即自然的杰作，时光最高贵的果实—我是一个有理性、有礼貌、食肉的人。</td>
		<td class="en">But after all I am no amoeba, no mere sack and stomach; I am capable of discourse, can ride a bicycle, look up trains in Bradshaw, in fact I am and calmly boast myself a Human Being—that Masterpiece of Nature, and noblest fruit of time—I am a rational, polite, meat-eating Man.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >怎样的星体相撞和漫天大火，怎样的洪水泛滥和杀戮，宇宙付出了多么巨大的努力才造就了我—我难道不是星体运行和宇宙过程中的王者和奇迹吗？</td>
		<td class="en">What stellar collisions and conflagrations, what floods and slaughters and enormous efforts has it not cost the Universe to make me—of what astral periods and cosmic processes am I not the crown, the wonder?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那么，我伟大的雕像应该安放在哪里的海滨广场或者主宰世界的阶地上；哪里的宫殿和凯旋门的景色能作我画像的背景；哪里的大理石台阶向着日出的地方延伸，且足够宽敞高贵，能让我靠着围栏尽情伸展四肢，舒服地休息？</td>
		<td class="en">Where, then, is the Esplanade or world-dominating Terrace for my sublime Statue; the landscape of palaces and triumphal arches for the background or my Portrait; stairs of marble, flung against the sunset, not too narrow and ignoble for me to pause with ample gesture on their balus-traded flights?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >复杂的问题</td>
		<td class="en">Complex Questions</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个时代，牧师先生总是这样评价，形势严峻；英国人正面对着许多复杂的问题。但是许多当时吸引我的问题，在牧师先生看来无疑都是些老生常谈、天马行空的念头。恐怕我太过频繁地陷入自己复杂的想法中；这些想法古怪地发展和变化着；它们怎么想象出英格兰的森林中住着森林仙子，或者如何将英格兰果园—在破晓时，或夕阳中—变成西方之国的花园。有时我脑海中萦绕的不过是一些名字：“玛格拉特、格尔拉特、萨拉依姆，”我暗自念着这几个名字；东方三博士的名字是这样的吗，还是爱托斯、萨托斯、帕拉托拉斯？那些与戴安娜一起沐浴时受到亚克托安惊吓的仙女们叫什么名字？那些追捕亚克托安并最终杀死这个鲁莽的闯入者的猎犬们都叫什么名字？有人叫它们拉冬、哈耳庇厄、雷拉普斯、奥瑞思特洛弗斯；还是，像其他可靠的书籍上写的：玻瑞阿斯、奥莫拉姆普斯、阿格柔斯、阿瑞图撒、戈尔格斯？</td>
		<td class="en">The Age, the Vicar would remark, was a serious one; Englishmen were met face to face with complex questions. But the questions that had an interest for me at that time, would no doubt have seemed to the Vicar, many of them, old and imaginary. I was too often occupied, I am afraid, with the complexities of my own thoughts; their odd travels and changes; their way of peopling English forests with wood- nymphs, or transforming English orchards—seen perhaps at dawn or in the late sunshine—into Hesperian gardens. Sometimes it was merely names that filled my mind: “Magalat, Galgalat, Saraim,” I syllabled to myself; were these the names of the Magi of the East2; or Atos, Satos, Paratoras? What were the names of the nymphs Actaeon3 surprised bathing with Diana? The names of the hounds that hunted to his death that rash intruder; Ladon, Harpyia, Laelaps, Oresitrophos, as some call them; or, as they are given in other authentic books, Boreas, Omelampus, Agreus, Aretusa, Gorgo?</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Beyond the blue hills, within riding distance, there is a country of parks and beeches, with views of the faded, far-off sea. I remember in one of my rides coming on the place which was the scene of the pretty, old-fashioned story of Silvia Doria. Through the gates, with fine gate-posts, on which heraldic beasts, fierce and fastidious, were upholding coroneted shields, I could see, at the end of the avenue, the façade of the House, with its stone pilasters, and its balustrade on the steep roof.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这座公园中坐落着一幢意大利风格的房子，还有平整的花园，里面点缀着许多雕像和庭园式寺庙。据说一百多年前，那里住着一位老勋爵和他的两个英俊的儿子。老勋爵的妻子早已过世，但他一直伤心不已；他从不拜访邻居，也极少有陌生人走进这座华美花园的围墙之内。然而，春季里的一天，在苹果花怒放的时节，那扇镀金的大门被推开了，腾跃的大马拉着一辆伦敦的马车沿着大道驶来。马车里坐着一位女子，正愉快地微笑着，她身穿黄色丝绸裙，头戴一顶宽大的西班牙帽，上面垂下几根羽毛，美丽非凡。这就是西尔维娅·多里亚，她来拜访他的表哥—老勋爵。</td>
		<td class="en">More than one hundred years ago, in that Park, with its Italianized house, and level gardens adorned with statues and garden temples, there lived, they say, an old Lord with his two handsome sons. The old Lord had never ceased mourning for his Lady, though she had died a good many years before; there were no neighbours he visited, and few strangers came inside the great Park walls. One day in Spring, however, just when the apple trees had burst into blossom, the gilded gates were thrown open, and a London chariot with prancing horses drove up the Avenue. And in the chariot, smiling and gay, and indeed very beautiful in her dress of yellow silk, and her great Spanish hat with drooping feathers, sat Silvia Doria, come on a visit to her cousin, the old Lord.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不管他的企图是什么，西尔维娅像春天一样，似阳光一般，来到这个孤独的地方。就连老勋爵，只要一听到她悦耳的声音在房子里响起，也感到莫名的快乐；至于亨利和弗朗西斯，只要与她并肩走在花园小径上，就犹如身在天堂了。</td>
		<td class="en">However this might be, Silvia Doria came like the Spring, like the sunlight, into the lonely place. Even the old Lord felt himself curiously happy when he heard her voice singing about the house; as for Henry and Francis, it was heaven for them just to walk by her side down the garden alleys.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管她的父亲热衷于追名逐利，她自己也对金钱和地位有种少女虚荣的喜爱，她的心上人却不是亨利，也不是老勋爵，而是小儿子弗朗西斯。弗朗西斯知道她的心意吗？丑闻传开了，他们是秘密的爱人。这个丑闻可能传到了她父亲的耳朵里。</td>
		<td class="en">But, in spite of her father, and her own girlish love of gold and rank, it was not for Henry that she cared, not for the old Lord, but for Francis, the younger son. Did Francis know of this? They were secretly lovers, the old scandal reported; and the scandal, it may be, had reached her father’s ears.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">And after she had gone, a long time, many of the eighteenth-century years went by without change. And then Henry, the elder son, was killed in hunting; and the old Lord dying a few years later, the titles and the great house and all the land and gold came to Francis, the younger son. But after his father’s death he was but seldom there; having, as it seemed, no love for the place, and living for the most part abroad and alone, for he never married.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">And again, many years went by. The trees grew taller and darker about the house; the yew hedges, unclipped now, hung their branches over the shadowy paths; ivy almost smothered the statues; and the plaster fell away in great patches from the discoloured garden temples.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But at last one day a chariot drove up to the gates; a footman pulled at the crazy bell, telling the gate-keeper that his mistress wished to visit the Park. So the gates creaked open, the chariot glittered up the avenue to the deserted place; and a lady stepped out, went into the garden, and walked among its moss-grown paths and statues. As the chariot drove out again, “Tell your Lord,” the lady said, smiling, to the lodge-keeper, “that Silvia Doria came back.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">To the West, in riding past the walls of Bligh, I remembered an incident in the well-known siege of that house, during the Civil Wars: How, among Waller’s invading Roundhead troops, there happened to be a young scholar, a poet, and lover of the Muses, fighting for the cause, as he thought, of ancient Freedom, who, one day, when the siege was being more hotly urged, pressing forward and climbing a wall, suddenly found himself in a quiet garden by the house. And here, for a time forgetting, as it would seem, the battle, and heedless of the bullets that now and then flew past him like peevish wasps, the young Officer stayed, gathering roses—old-fashioned damask roses, streaked with red and white—which, for the sake of a Court Beauty, there besieged with her father, he carried to the house; falling, however, struck by a chance bullet, or shot perhaps by one of his own party. A few of the young Officer’s verses, written in the stilted fashion of the time, and almost unreadable now, have been preserved. The lady’s portrait hangs in the white drawing-room at Bligh; a simpering, faded figure, with ringlets and drop-pearls, and a dress of amber-coloured silk.</td></tr>

And so it was believed that every man or woman had, from the cradle, fighting for or against him or her, some great Star, Formalhaut, perhaps, Aldebaran, Altair: while great Heroes and Princes were more splendidly attended, and marched out to their forgotten battles with troops and armies of heavenly Constellations.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就是在这里，在这个教堂里，我曾经见到尤斯塔斯·卡尔爵士。我渐渐发现每次我进去时他都在同一个角落，有时我会观察他的脸，直到仪式的蜡烛一根一根熄灭，把我们留在模糊的夜色中。那是一张沉思中的英俊面孔，我记得不止一次想知道，是什么让他在那个不合时宜的月份来到威尼斯，为什么他如此规律地参加这个单调枯燥的仪式。他好像被施了咒语。现在，我的好奇心又被唤醒，我问自己那个咒语是什么？我一定也受到了它的影响，因为我也和他一起默默无语地坐在那里。我感到，这也许就是我问题的答案，就是那个让我困惑的谜一样的秘密；当我回忆起当时之事，唤醒那阴郁、甚至邪恶的迷恋，我仿佛看到一个答案在我的想象面前慢慢显现。但是这是一个答案、一个假设或者猜想，如此不可思议，以至于我的常识几乎不能接受它。因为我现在看到，那时在威尼斯施在我们两人身上的咒语不是别的，而就是死亡的想法这一可怕的魔咒。那个可怖的城市和它日趋腐朽的宫殿和布满坟墓的教堂，在那几个黑暗、孤寂的星期里，真的仿佛是死神这个恐怖之王的故乡和首府；拂晓和黄昏时举行的礼拜、为死者祈祷的人、葬礼上的蜡烛，是为了崇拜他而举行的吟唱着圣歌的仪式。现在假设（这是我想象出的解释），假设这个咒语，这个我只在短暂的时间里隐约感觉到的咒语，真的会使某人深陷其中，向一个原本充满生机和快乐的生命投下越来越浓重的阴影，直至完全把它覆盖，那么这难道不能为尤斯塔斯·卡尔爵士身上发生的事情提供一丝线索吗——不光是他对被埋葬的东方的兴趣，他在那个时候现身威尼斯，还有他那无法解释的神秘的终结，难道不能提供一些线索吗？</td>
		<td class="en">It was here, in this church, that I used to see Sir Eustace Carr; would generally find him in the same corner when I entered, and would sometimes watch his face, until the ceremonious extinguishing of the candles, one by one, left us in shadowy night. It was a handsome and thoughtful face, and I remember more than once wondering what had brought him to Venice in that unseasonable month, and why he came so regularly to this monotonous service. It was as if some spell had drawn him, and now, with my curiosity newly wakened, I asked myself what had been that spell? I also must have been affected by it, for I had been there also in his uncommunicating company. Here, I felt, was perhaps the answer to my question, the secret of the enigma that puzzled me, and as I went over my memories of that time, and revived its sombre and almost sinister fascination, I seemed to see an answer looming before my imagination. But it was an answer, an hypothesis or supposition, so fantastic, that my common-sense could hardly accept it. For I now saw that the spell which had been on us both at that time in Venice had been nothing but the spell and tremendous incantation of the Thought of Death. The dreary city with its decaying palaces and great tomb-encumbered churches had really seemed, in those dark and desolate weeks, to be the home and metropolis of the King of Terrors; and the services at dawn and twilight, with their prayers for the Dead, and funereal candles, had been the chanted ritual of his worship. Now suppose (such was the notion that held my imagination) suppose this spell, which I had felt but for a time and dimly, should become to someone a real obsession, casting its shadow more and more completely over a life otherwise prosperous and happy, might not this be the clue to a history like that of Sir Eustace Carr’s— not only his interest in the buried East, his presence at that time in Venice, but also his unexplained and mysterious end?</td></tr>

This, as I say, was the notion that haunted me, the link my imagination forged between Sir Eustace Carr’s presence in that dark Venetian church, and his death some years later. But whether it is really a clue to that unexplained mystery, or whether it is nothing more than a somewhat sinister fancy, of course I cannot say.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">For I had seen the old man once—curiously enough at the time of a Harvest Festival, though it was some years before the one which had led to his disappearance. Bicycling one day over the hills, I had ridden down into a valley of cornfields, and then, passing along an unfenced road that ran across a wide expanse of stubble, I came, after getting off to open three or four gates, upon a group of thatched cottages, with a little, unrestored Norman church standing among great elms. I left my bicycle and walked through the churchyard, and as I went into the church, through its deeply- recessed Norman doorway, a surprisingly pretty sight met my eyes. The dim, cool, little interior was set out and richly adorned with an abundance of fruit and vegetables, yellow gourds, apples and plums and golden wheat- sheaves, great loaves of bread, and garlands of September flowers. A shabby-looking old clergyman was standing on the top of a step-ladder, finishing the decorations, when I entered. As soon as he saw me he came down, and I spoke to him, praising the decorations, and raising my voice a little, for I noticed that he was deaf. We spoke of the Harvest Festival; and as I soon perceived that I was talking with a man of books and University education, I ventured to hint at what had vividly impressed me in that old, gaudily-decorated church—its pagan character, as if it were a rude archaic temple in some corner of the antique world, which had been adorned, two thousand years ago, by pious country folk for some local festival. The old clergyman was not in the least shocked by my remark; it seemed indeed rather to please him; there was, he agreed, something of a pagan character in the modern Harvest Festival—it was no doubt a bit of the old primitive Vegetation Ritual, the old Religion of the soil; a Festival which, like so many others, had not been destroyed by Christianity, but absorbed into it, and given a new meaning. “Indeed,” he added, talking on as if the subject interested him, and expressing himself with a certain donnish carefulness of speech that I found pleasant to listen to, “the Harvest Festival is undoubtedly a survival of the prehistoric worship of that Corn Goddess who, in classical times, was called Demeter and Ioulo and Ceres, but whose cult as an Earth-Mother and Corn-Spirit is of much greater antiquity. For there is no doubt that this Vegetation Spirit has been worshipped from the earliest times by agricultural peoples; the wheat fields and ripe harvest being naturally suggestive of the presence amid the corn of a kindly Being, who, in return for due rites and offerings, will vouchsafe nourishing rains and golden harvests.” He mentioned the references in Virgil67, and the description in Theocritus68 of a Sicilian Harvest Festival—these were no doubt familiar to me, but if I was interested in the subject, I should find, he said, much more information collected in a book which he had written, but of which I had probably never heard, about the Vegetation Deities in Greek Religion. As it happened I knew the book, and felt now much interested in my chance in meeting with the distinguished scholar; and after expressing this as best I could, I rode off, promising to visit him again. This promise I was never able to fulfil; but when afterward, on my return to the neighbourhood, I heard of that unhappy scandal, my memory of this meeting and our talk enabled me to form a theory as to what had really happened.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">It seemed plain to me that the change had been too violent for this elderly student, taken from his books and college rooms and set down in the solitude of this remote valley, amid the richness, and living sap of Nature. The gay spectacle, right under his old eyes, of growing shoots and budding foliage, of blossoming and flowering, and the ripening of fruits and crops, the pairing of birds and the mating of cattle, had little by little (such was my theory) unhinged his brains. More and more his thoughts had come to dwell, not on the doctrines of the Church in which he had long ago taken orders, but on the pagan rites which had formed his life-long study, and which had been the expression of a life not unlike the agricultural life amid which he now found himself living. So as his derangement grew upon him in his isolation, he had gradually transformed, with a maniac’s cunning, the Christian services, and led his little congregation, all unknown to themselves, back toward their ancestral worship of the Corn- Goddess. At last he had thrown away all disguise, and had appeared as a hierophant of Demeter, dressed in a fawn skin, with a crown of poplar leaves, and pedantically carrying the mystic basket and the winnowing fan appropriate to these mysteries. The wheaten posset he offered the shocked communicants belonged to these also, and the figure of a woman on the altar was of course the holy Wheatsheaf, whose unveiling was the culminating point in that famous ritual.</td></tr>

Some of the things that reached my ears I refused to believe—the mention of pig’s blood, for instance, and especially the talk of certain grosser symbols, which the choir boys, it was whispered, had carried in their hands about the church in ceremonious procession. Village people have strange imaginations; and to this event, growing more and more monstrous as they talked it over, they must themselves have added this grotesque detail. However, I have written to consult an Oxford authority on this interesting point, and he has been kind enough to explain at length that although at the Haloa, or winter festival of the Corn-Goddess, and also at the Chloeia, or festival in early spring, some symbolization of the reproductive powers of Nature would be proper and appropriate, such ritualism would have been quite out of place at the Thalysia, or autumn festival of thanksgiving.
