		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >法国大革命轰轰烈烈进行之际，在一个风雨交加的夜晚，一名德国青年深夜穿过巴黎旧区，走在回住所的路上。电光闪闪，雷声穿过那些又高又窄的街道隆隆地震动着——但我首先应该要告诉你这位德国青年的一些情况。</td>
		<td class="en">On a stormy night, in the tempestuous times of the French Revolution, a young German was returning to his lodgings, at a late hour, across the old part of Paris.The lightning gleamed, and the loud claps of thunder rattled through the lofty, narrow streets—but I should first tell you something about this young German.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >戈特弗里德·沃尔夫冈是一个来自好家庭的青年。他在哥廷根学习过一段时间，但由于天性热情、爱好幻想，他误入了叛经离道、不切实际的学说，当时很多德国学生常常被此迷惑。他离群索居，学习特别用功，而他的研究本身非常单调，这些都对他的身心都造成了影响。他不但身体垮了，精神上也是病态。他一直痴迷于离奇思考的精神本质。直到后来，他像斯韦登伯格一样，在自己的周围构建了一个理想世界。我也不清楚他哪来的念头，反正他说有魔鬼缠绕着他：一个要诱惑他，送他下地狱的恶魔鬼怪。这种奇怪的念头加上他那本已忧郁的气质，让他看上去非常地死气沉沉。他变得憔悴而消沉。朋友们看出沃尔夫冈是精神上出了问题，认为最好的治疗方法就是给他换个环境，因此他被送到繁华欢快的巴黎去完成他的学业。</td>
		<td class="en">Gottfried Wolfgang was a young man of good family.He had studied for some time at Gottingen, but being of a visionary and enthusiastic character, he had wandered into those wild and speculative doctrines which have so often bewildered German students.His secluded life, his intense application, and the singular nature of his studies, had an effect on both mind and body.His health was impaired; his imagination diseased.He had been indulging in fanciful speculations on spiritual essences, until, like Swedenborg, he had an ideal world of his own around him.He took up a notion, I do not know from what cause, that there was an evil influence hanging over him: an evil genius or spirit seeking to ensnare him and ensure his perdition.Such an idea working on his melancholy temperament produced the most gloomy effects.He became haggard and desponding.His friends discovered the mental malady that was preying upon him, and determined that the best cure was a change of scene; he was sent, therefore, to finish his studies amidst the splendours and gaieties of Paris.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >沃尔夫冈在大革命爆发的时候来到了巴黎。一开始，群众的狂热投合了他热切的情绪，他被时下的政治和哲学理论所迷惑。但随后而来的流血场面震动了他那敏感的特质，让他对社会对世界都感到厌恶，使他变得更加孤僻。他在学生们聚居的拉丁区里找了间独立的住所，把自己关了起来。房子在离索邦神学院不远的一条阴森的街道上，就在这里，他又开始沉迷于自己喜欢的那套空想。有时，他在巴黎大图书馆里一呆就是几个钟头。他在那些去世作家遗留的书堆里，挖掘那些封尘中的陈腐书籍，吞噬着他的精神粮食，满足他那不健康的胃口。在某种意义上，他成了一个文字食尸鬼，在腐朽文献的停尸房里寻找粮食。</td>
		<td class="en">Wolfgang arrived at Paris at the breaking out of the Revolution.The popular delirium at first caught bis enthusiastic mind, and he was captivated by the political and philosophical theories of the day: but the scenes of blood which followed shocked his sensitive nature, disgusted him with society and the world, and made him more than ever a recluse.He shut himself up in a solitary apartment in the Pays Latin, the quarter of students.There, in a gloomy street, not far from the monastic walls of the Sorbonne, he pursued his favourite speculations.Sometimes he spent hours together in the great libraries of Paris, those catacombs of departed authors, rummaging among their hoards of dusty and obsolete works in quest of food for his unhealthy appetite.He was, in a manner, a literary goul, feeding in the charnel-house of decayed literature.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >沃尔夫冈虽然生活孤独、隐遁，但性情热烈，只不过一时用在了想象上。他过于腼腆，又不懂人情世故，因此不敢接近女人，但他却热烈地倾慕着女性的美。在他孤单的房间里，他经常会沉迷于幻想那些他见过的形影面孔，而且在幻想中他会装扮一些远远超越现实的可爱的形象。</td>
		<td class="en">Wolfgang, though solitary and recluse, was of an ardent temperament, but for a time it operated merely upon his imagination.He was too shy and ignorant of the world to make any advances to the fair, but he was a passionate admirer of female beauty, and in his lonely chamber would often lose himself in reveries on forms and faces which he had seen, and his fancy would deck out images of loveliness far surpassing the reality.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >正当他思绪激荡，想得出神入化的时候，他做了一个影响非凡的梦。那是一张绝美的女性面孔。美到让他印象深刻，以至于他接二连三地梦到。那面容白天萦绕在他的思绪中，夜晚出现在他的梦中。最后，他热烈地迷恋上了梦中的这个幻影。久而久之，对于心怀忧郁的人来说，这就变成了牢固的念头，有时别人以为他疯了。</td>
		<td class="en">While his mind was in this excited and sublimated state, he had a dream which produced an extraordinary effect upon him.It was of a female face of transcendent beauty.So strong was the impression it made, that he dreamt of it again and again.It haunted his thoughts by day, his slumbers by night; in fine, he became passionately enamoured of this shadow of a dream.This lasted so long that it became one of those fixed ideas which haunt the minds of melancholy men, and are at times mistaken for madness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >戈特弗里德·沃尔夫冈就是这样一个人，在故事的开端他就处于这样的状态。在一个风雨交加的夜晚，他正穿过巴黎马雷斯老区古老阴暗的街道，行走在回家的路上。轰隆隆的雷声响彻在高耸的房屋和狭窄的街道间。他来到德格雷夫广场，就是公共的死刑刑场。电光在古老的市政厅的尖顶上闪动，照得前面的空地忽明忽暗。沃尔夫冈穿过广场，一见自己来到断头台边，吓得直往后退。当时正值恐怖统治的高峰期，这个恐怖的杀人武器随时准备着，断头台上不停地流淌着正直、勇敢之士的鲜血。就在当天断头台还大肆发挥了作用，杀了许多人，此刻它阴森森地陈列在一个死寂沉睡的城市里，等待着新鲜的牺牲品。</td>
		<td class="en">Such was Gottfried Wolfgang, and such his situation at the time I mentioned.He was returning home late one stormy night, through some of the old and gloomy streets of the Marais, the ancient part of Paris.The loud claps of thunder rattled among the high houses of the narrow streets.He came to the Place de Greve, the square where public executions are performed.The lightning quivered about the pinnacles of the ancient Hotel de Ville, and shed flickering gleams over the open space in front.As Wolfgang was crossing the square, he shrunk back with horror at finding himself close by the guillotine.It was the height of the Reign of Terror, when this dreadful instrument of death stood ever ready, and its scaffold was continually running with the blood of the virtuous and the brave.It had that very day been actively employed in the work of carnage, and there it stood in grim array amidst a silent and sleeping city, waiting for fresh victims.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >沃尔夫冈心里感到一阵厌恶，在他正要战战兢兢地转身远离这架可怕的机器时，似乎有一个身影在断头台下的阶梯底蜷缩成一团。几道雪亮的闪电接连划过，人影显得格外分明。原来那是一个女人，穿着黑色的衣服。她坐在断头台下较低的台阶上，身子前倾，脸埋在膝盖里，乱蓬蓬的头发一束束垂到地面。她的脸色苍白，但在丰盈乌黑的长发衬托下，她显得惊人地美丽。她有一双明亮的大眼睛，神色异常，几乎快要发狂。她虽身着一身黑裙，但仍能看出，她身段十分匀称。尽管她穿着极其简朴，整个仪表却极其动人。她身上像装饰品的只有一条围着脖子、用一颗颗钻石扣起来的黑色宽边领带。</td>
		<td class="en">Wolfgang’s heart sickened within him, and he was turning shuddering from the horrible engine, when he beheld a shadowy form cowering as it were at the foot of the steps which led up to the scaffold.A succession of vivid flashes of lightning revealed it more distinctly.It was a female figure, dressed in black.She was seated on one of the lower steps of the scaffold, leaning forward, her face hid in her lap, and her long dishevelled tresses hanging to the Her face was pale, but of a dazzling fairness, set off by a profusion of raven hair that hung clustering about it.Her eyes were large and brilliant, with a singular expression that approached almost to wildness.As far as her black dress permitted her shape to be seen, it was of perfect symmetry.Her whole appearance was highly striking, though she was dressed in the simplest style.The only thing approaching to an ornament which she wore, was a broad black band round her neck, clasped by diamonds.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这位学生开始为难起来，这样一位无助的女人前来投奔他的庇护，要如何安顿才好。他想到把自己的房间让给她，自己再另寻住处。但是他已经完全为她的风韵所痴迷，似乎有一道咒语镇住他的所想所感，他想走也走不开。而她的举止也变得奇怪，叫人说不清楚。她不再谈断头台。她也不再那么悲痛。这位学生的殷勤起先赢得了她的信任，显然现在又赢得了她的心。她明显变得和他一样热情，而热情的人相互之间很快便心心相印了。</td>
		<td class="en">The perplexity now commenced with the student how to dispose of the helpless being thus thrown upon his protection.He thought of abandoning his chamber to her, and seeking shelter for himself elsewhere.Still he was so fascinated by her charms, there seemed to be such a spell upon his thoughts and senses, that he could not tear himself from her presence.Her manner, too, was singular and unaccountable.She spoke no more of the guillotine.Her grief had abated.The attentions of the student had first won her confidence, and then, apparently, her heart.She was evidently an enthusiast like himself, and enthusiasts soon understand each other.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >沃尔夫冈在迷惑中向她坦白了爱慕之情。他向她倾诉自己那个神秘的梦，以及如何在见面之前早就迷恋上她。听到这番表白，她莫名地感动，还坦言自己对他也有一种说不出的情意。当时正是理论狂放和行为不羁的时代。陈旧的偏见和迷信都被取消了，一切都听命于“理智女神”。婚姻的形式和礼节也当属旧时代的废弃物，只要思想崇高，这些都是多余的束缚。当时这种社会契约正流行。沃尔夫冈本是个理论家，听到当时的自由主义，不免受些熏染。</td>
		<td class="en">In the infatuation of the moment Wolfgang avowed his passion for her.He told her the story of his mysterious dream, and how she had possessed his heart before he had even seen her.She was strangely affected by his recital, and acknowledged to have felt an impulse toward him equally unaccountable.It was the time for wild theory and wild actions.Old prejudices and superstitions were done away; everything was under the sway of the “Goddess of Reason.” Among other rubbish of the old times, the forms and ceremonies of marriage began to be considered superfluous bonds for honourable minds.Social compacts were the vogue.Wolfgang was too much of a theorist not to be tainted by the liberal doctrines of the day.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们何必要分开呢？”他说，“我们已结同心，理智上、道德上我们已经合为一体。两颗高尚的心灵相系在一起，又何必要那些肮脏的形式呢？”陌生人含情脉脉地听着，显然她也受到同一学说的启发。“你没有了家，也没有了亲人,”他继续说道，“那就让我成为你的全部，或者不如说，让我们成为彼此的全部。假如必须要有什么形式的话，那我们遵守形式——这是我的手。我向你立下永远的誓言。”“永远？”陌生人严肃地问道。“永远！”沃尔夫冈重复道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Why should we separate?” said he: “our hearts are united; in the eye of reason and honour we are as one.What need is there of sordid forms to bind high souls together?” The stranger listened with emotion: she had evidently received illumination at the same school.—“You have no home nor family,” continued he; “let me be everything to you, or rather let us be everything to one another.If form is necessary, form shall be observed—there is my hand.I pledge myself to you for ever.”—“For ever ?” said the stranger, solemnly.—“For ever!” repeated Wolfgang.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那陌生人握紧伸向她的手：“那我是你的人了。”她一面呢喃道，一面靠在他的怀里。第二天早晨学生离开睡梦中的新娘，出去寻找一间更宽敞的公寓，好迎接新的改变。当他回来时他发现陌生人垂着头躺着，一只胳膊抱着头。他跟她说话，她却不作声。他上前叫醒她，免得她那样睡得不舒服。可他拉她的手时，发现她的手是冰冷的——没有脉搏——脸色苍白，像死人一般。总之，她只是具尸体。</td>
		<td class="en">The stranger clasped the hand extended to her: “Then I am yours,” murmured she, and sunk upon his bosom.The next morning the student left his bride sleeping, and sallied forth at an early hour to seek more spacious apartments, suitable to the change in his situation.When he returned, he found the stranger lying with her head hanging over the bed, and one arm thrown over it.He spoke to her, but received no reply.He advanced to awaken her from her uneasy posture.On taking her hand, it was cold—there was no pulsation—her face was pallid and ghastly.In a word, she was a corpse.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >恐怖慌张之时，他惊动了整个公寓。接着是一阵忙乱。警察也被叫来了。当警官进屋、看见那具尸体时，警察惊得直往后退。</td>
		<td class="en">Horrified and frantic he alarmed the house.A scene of confusion ensued.The police was summoned.As the officer of police entered the room, he started back on beholding the corpse.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“天哪！”他喊道，“这个女人怎么会来这里？”“你认识她吗？”沃尔夫冈急迫地问道。“我认识？”警官大喊，“她昨天上了断头台！”他上前，解开尸体脖子上的黑色领带，那颗头骨碌一声就滚到了地板上！</td>
		<td class="en">“Great heaven!” cried he, “how did this woman come here?”—“Do you know anything about her?” said Wolfgang, eagerly.—“Do I?” exclaimed the police officer: “she was guillotined yesterday!” He stepped forward; undid the black collar round the neck of the corpse, and the head rolled on the floor!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >学生一下子疯了。“这个恶鬼！这个恶鬼把我骗到手了！”他尖叫到，“我彻底完蛋了！”人们试着安慰他，却没用。他认定了那个可怕的信念，即有一个恶魔附在死尸上想要诱捕他。他神经错乱，最后死在疯人院里。</td>
		<td class="en">The student burst into a frenzy.“The fiend ! the fiend has gained possession of me!” shrieked he: “lam lost for ever!”—They tried to soothe him, but in vain.He was possessed with the frightful belief that an evil spirit had re-animated the dead body to ensnare him.He went distracted, and died in a madhouse.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一脑袋鬼故事的老先生讲完了这个故事。“这是真的？”好问先生又问道。“绝对真实，”另一个回答道。“故事来源绝对可信。是那个学生亲口告诉我的。我在巴黎的疯人院见到他了。”【1】</td>
		<td class="en">Here the old gentleman with the haunted head finished his narrative.—“And is this really a fact?” said the inquisitive gentleman.—“A fact not to be doubted,” replied the other.“I had it from the best authority.The student told it me himself.I saw him in a madhouse at Paris.”[1]</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >【1】以上故事的后半部分是依据我讲过的一个奇闻而创作的。据说故事有法语的印刷版，不过我没见过。</td>
		<td class="en">[1] The latter part of the above story is founded on an anecdote related to me, and said to exist in print in French. I have not met with it in print.</td></tr>
