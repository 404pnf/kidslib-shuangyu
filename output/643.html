		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一八九五年十一月的第三个星期，浓重的黄雾在伦敦扎下了营盘。现在我依然怀疑，在那个星期，星期一到星期四的那段时间里，从我们贝克街寓所的窗子望出去，究竟有没有过能看见对面房子轮廓的时候。第一天，福尔摩斯打发时间的方法是替他那本大部头参考手册编制互见索引，第二天和第三天，他耐着性子研究中世纪的音乐，那是他新近培养起来的一个爱好。可是，到了第四天，我们又一次吃完早饭，把椅子从餐桌跟前挪开，又一次看见那股油乎乎、沉甸甸的黄褐色涡流飘过眼前，看见它在窗子玻璃上凝成一颗颗油汪汪的水珠，我这位天生急躁好动的室友终于对这种死水一潭的生活忍无可忍。无处发泄的精力驱使他没完没了地在客厅里踱来踱去，咬着指甲、敲着家具，为这种百无聊赖的局面大光其火。</td>
		<td class="en">In the third week of November, in the year 1895, a dense yellow fog settled down upon London. From the Monday to the Thursday I doubt whether it was ever possible from our windows in Baker Street to see the loom of the opposite houses. The first day Holmes had spent in cross-indexing his huge book of references. The second and third had been patiently occupied upon a subject which he had recently made his hobby—the music of the Middle Ages. But when, for the fourth time, after pushing back our chairs from breakfast we saw the greasy, heavy brown swirl still drifting past us and condensing in oily drops upon the window-panes, my comrade’s impatient and active nature could endure this drab existence no longer. He paced restlessly about our sitting-room in a fever of suppressed energy, biting his nails, tapping the furniture, and chafing against inaction.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“报纸上找不出什么有意思的东西吗，华生？”他说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Nothing of interest in the paper, Watson?” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我早就已经知道，福尔摩斯嘴里的“有意思”，意思就是有意思的罪案。报纸上讲到了一次革命，讲到了一场可能爆发的战争，还讲到了一个即将更迭的政府，只可惜，这些事情都不在我室友的考虑范围之内。我没能在报纸上找到什么奇案大案，福尔摩斯哀叹一声，没完没了的踱步再次开始。</td>
		<td class="en">I was aware that by anything of interest, Holmes meant anything of criminal interest. There was the news of a revolution, of a possible war, and of an impending change of government; but these did not come within the horizon of my companion. I could see nothing recorded in the shape of crime which was not commonplace and futile. Holmes groaned and resumed his restless meanderings.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“毫无疑问，伦敦的罪犯都是些庸碌之辈，”他说话的口气愤愤不平，活脱脱是一名找不到称心猎物的猎手。“你往窗子外面看看吧，华生。看看那些人影，看他们怎么渐渐浮现，模模糊糊地露个脸，转眼就再次消失在浓雾之中。这样的日子里，窃贼和凶手完全可以放开手脚嘛，他们可以在伦敦随意游荡，就像是密林之中的老虎，即便到了发起突袭的那一刻，也只有受害者能把他们看个清楚。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The London criminal is certainly a dull fellow,” said he in the querulous voice of the sportsman whose game has failed him. “Look out of this window, Watson. See how the figures loom up, are dimly seen, and then blend once more into the cloud-bank. The thief or the murderer could roam London on such a day as the tiger does the jungle, unseen until he pounces, and then evident only to his victim.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“This great and sombre stage is set for something more worthy than that,” said he. “it is fortunate for this community that i am not a criminal.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“确实如此，千真万确！”我发自肺腑地表示同意。</td>
		<td class="en">“it is, indeed!” said i heartily.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“假设我是布鲁克斯或者伍德豪斯，或者是其他某个有充分理由取我性命的人，那样的人一共有五十个，那么，面临我自己的追杀，我能活多久呢？一张传票、一次虚假的约会，一切不就完结了嘛。那些暗杀成风的拉美国家没有雾天，倒还真是件好事哩。天哪！瞧，终于有点儿事情来打破这种死气沉沉的局面了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Suppose that I were Brooks or Woodhouse, or any of the fifty men who have good reason for taking my life, how long could i survive against my own pursuit? A summons, a bogus appointment, and all would be over. it is well they don’t have days of fog in the latin countries—the countries of assassination. By Jove! here comes something at last to break our dead monotony.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >原来是女仆送来了一封电报。福尔摩斯拆开电报，突然间大笑起来。</td>
		<td class="en">It was the maid with a telegram. Holmes tore it open and burst out laughing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好，好啊！接下来会是什么呢？”他说道，“眼下的事情是，我哥哥迈克罗夫特要来了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, well! What next?” said he. “Brother Mycroft is coming round.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这有什么好奇怪的呢？”我问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Why not?” i asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“有什么好奇怪？这样的情形好比是一辆有轨电车[^2]出现在了乡村小路上。迈克罗夫特有他自己的轨道，轻易也不会脱轨。位于朴尔莫尔大街的寓所、第欧根尼俱乐部，再加上白厅[^3]，他生活的圈子不外如是。他来过这儿一次，也只有那么一次[^4]。眼下他居脱离了自己的轨道，到底是出了什么样的乱子呢？” </td>
		<td class="en">“Why not? it is as if you met a tram-car coming down a country lane. Mycroft has his rails and he runs on them. His Pall Mall lodgings, the Diogenes Club, Whitehall—that is his cycle. once, and only once, he has been here. What upheaval can possibly have derailed him?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他自己没有说吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Does he not explain?”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我倒是一点儿印象也没有。不过，想想吧，迈克罗夫特竟然会以这么古怪的方式打破常规！简直就跟行星脱离了轨道差不多。对了，你知道迈克罗夫特是干什么的吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“It recalls nothing to my mind. But that Mycroft should break out in this erratic fashion! A planet might as well leave its orbit. By the way, do you know what Mycroft is?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我依稀记得，在处理“希腊译员案”的时候，福尔摩斯曾经跟我说过这件事情。</td>
		<td class="en">I had some vague recollection of an explanation at the time of the Adventure of the Greek interpreter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你以前告诉过我，他是中央政府的一名小职员。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You told me that he had some small office under the British government.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >福尔摩斯吃吃地笑了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">Holmes chuckled.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那个时候，我还不怎么了解你呢。谈论国家大事的时候，不谨慎一点儿是不行的。你说他替中央政府做事，没错；如果你说他有些时候就是中央政府，从某种意义上说，也没错。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I did not know you quite so well in those days. one has to be discreet when one talks of high matters of state. You are right in thinking that he is under the British government. You would also be right in a sense if you said that occasionally he *is*the British government.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“亲爱的福尔摩斯！”</td>
		<td class="en">“My dear Holmes!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我就知道你多半会大吃一惊。迈克罗夫特一年只挣四百五十镑，老老实实地待在幕僚的位置上，没有任何雄心壮志，得不到任何荣誉和头衔，即便如此，他仍然是这个国家里最不可或缺的人物。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I thought i might surprise you. Mycroft draws four hundred and fifty pounds a year, remains a subordinate, has no ambitions of any kind, will receive neither honour nor title, but remains the most indispensable man in the country.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“怎么叫不可或缺呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“But how?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这么说吧，他占据着一个独一无二的位置。这样的位置是他自己给自己打造的，以前不曾有过，将来也不会再有。他的头脑极度缜密、极有条理、极其擅长储存事实，世上无人可以匹敌。我用来侦破罪案的那些高超本领他也有，只不过被他用在了他自个儿的特殊行当上。政府各部的决议都会从他手里经过，他好比是情报交换中枢，好比是票据交换所，各个账户的盈亏都在他那里得到体现。其他的人都是擅长某一方面的专家，他的专长则是无所不知。打个比方说，某位大臣需要了解某个问题，那个问题同时牵扯到海军事务、印度事务、加拿大事务和金银复本位货币制度。在这种情况下，那位大臣固然可以从相关部门分别取得相关的材料，可是，只有迈克罗夫特同时掌握所有的材料，能够随口说出各种因素之间的相互影响。刚开始的时候，他们只是把他当成一条捷径、一道方便之门，眼下呢，他已经把自己变成了一个不可缺少的人物。他那颗了不起的头脑分门别类地储存着所有的材料，要用的时候就可以马上取出来。他的意见一次又一次地决定了国家的大政方针，这就是他全部的生活。别的事情他一概不想，只有在我向他求教的时候，他才会放松放松，想想我带去的那些小问题，权当是练练脑子。可是，这样一位大神却在今天从天而降，究竟会是什么意思呢？卡多根·韦斯特到底是谁，他跟迈克罗夫特又有什么关系呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, his position is unique. He has made it for himself. There has never been anything like it before, nor will be again. He has the tidiest and most orderly brain, with the greatest capacity for storing facts, of any man living. The same great powers which i have turned to the detection of crime he has used for this particular business. The conclusions of every department are passed to him, and he is the central exchange, the clearing-house, which makes out the balance. All other men are specialists, but his specialism is omniscience. We will suppose that a minister needs information as to a point which involves the navy, india, Canada and the bimetallic question; he could get his separate advices from various departments upon each, but only Mycroft can focus them all, and say offhand how each factor would affect the other. They began by using him as a short-cut, a convenience; now he has made himself an essential. in that great brain of his everything is pigeon-holed and can be handed out in an instant. Again and again his word has decided the national policy. He lives in it. He thinks of nothing else save when, as an intellectual exercise, he unbends if i call upon him and ask him to advise me on one of my little problems. But Jupiter is descending to-day. What on earth can it mean? Who is Cadogan West, and what is he to Mycroft?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我知道了，”我嚷了一句，一头扎进了沙发上那堆乱七八糟的报纸。“没错，没错，他就在这儿，错不了！卡多根·韦斯特就是那个小伙子，星期二早晨，人们在地铁里发现了他的尸体。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I have it,” i cried, and plunged among the litter of papers upon the sofa. “Yes, yes, here he is, sure enough! Cadogan West was the young man who was found dead on the underground on Tuesday morning.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这句话立刻攫住了福尔摩斯的注意，他坐直身子，正在往嘴里送的烟斗停在了半空。</td>
		<td class="en">Holmes sat up at attention, his pipe halfway to his lips.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这件事情一定是非常严重，华生。能让我哥哥改变自己的生活习惯，这样的死亡事件一定不一般。说到底，他跟这件事情能有什么关系呢？按我的记忆，这件案子并没有什么特异之处啊。这个小伙子显然是掉到了车厢外面，自个儿摔死的。他没有遭到抢劫，身上也没有明显的暴力伤害迹象，难道我说得不对吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“This must be serious, Watson. A death which has caused my brother to alter his habits can be no ordinary one. What in the world can he have to do with it? The case was featureless as i remember it. The young man had apparently fallen out of the train and killed himself. He had not been robbed, and there was no particular reason to suspect violence. is that not so?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“死因调查已经结束了，”我说道，“他们又发现了很多新的情况。要我说，细看起来，这还真是件古怪的案子呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There has been an inquest,” said i, “and a good many fresh facts have come out. looked at more closely, i should certainly say that it was a curious case.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“从它对我哥哥造成的影响来看，我只能认为它非常不一般。”他窝进了他那把扶手椅。“好了，华生，把案情说来听听吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Judging by its effect upon my brother, i should think it must be a most extraordinary one.” He snuggled down in his armchair. “now, Watson, let us have the facts.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这个人名叫阿瑟 ·卡多根 ·韦斯特，现年二十七岁，未婚，是伍利奇兵工厂[^5]的一名职员。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The man’s name was Arthur Cadogan West. He was twenty-seven years of age, unmarried, and a clerk at Woolwich Arsenal.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“原来他是政府雇员啊，瞧，这就跟迈克罗夫特老哥挂上钩了吧！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Government employ. Behold the link with Brother Mycroft!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“星期一晚上，他突然离开了伍利奇。最后一个见到他的人是他的未婚妻维奥莱特·韦斯特伯里小姐，当晚七点半左右，他突然独自离开，把他的未婚妻撇在了大雾之中。之前他俩并没有吵架，她想不出他为什么要这么做。再听到他的音信的时候，他已经变成了一具尸体，发现尸体的是一个名为梅森的养路工人，地点则是在伦敦的地铁里，紧挨着奥尔德盖特地铁站的地方。”</td>
		<td class="en">“He left Woolwich suddenly on Monday night. Was last seen by his fiancée, Miss Violet Westbury, whom he left abruptly in the fog about 7:30 that evening. There was no quarrel between them and she can give no motive for his action. The next thing heard of him was when his dead body was discovered by a plate-layer named Mason, just outside Aldgate Station on the underground system in london.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“时间呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“When?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“发现尸体的时间是星期二早晨六点钟。尸体躺在铁轨外面，按东行方向来说是在铁轨左边，位置离车站很近，正好是在地铁线穿出隧道的地方。死者的脑袋已经碎裂，很可能是因为从车上掉下来的缘故。尸体只可能是从车上掉到地铁里的，要想从附近的街道搬过去的话，那就必须得经过站口的栅栏，栅栏旁边始终都站着一名验票员。看样子，这一点绝不会有什么疑问。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The body was found at six on the Tuesday morning. it was lying wide of the metals upon the left hand of the track as one goes eastward, at a point close to the station, where the line emerges from the tunnel in which it runs. The head was badly crushed—an injury which might well have been caused by a fall from the train. The body could only have come on the line in that way. Had it been carried down from any neighbouring street, it must have passed the station barriers, where a collector is always standing. This point seems absolutely certain.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“很好。案情可算是相当明确，这个人可能是自己掉下了地铁列车，也可能是被人推下去的，掉下去的时候可能还活着，也可能已经死了。这些我都听明白了。接着说吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Very good. The case is definite enough. The man, dead or alive, either fell or was precipitated from a train. So much is clear to me. Continue.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“在尸体旁边那些铁轨上行驶的都是东去的列车，有一些只在市内行驶，也有一些来自威尔斯登[^6]，或者是其他的一些外围车站。可以确定的是，这个小伙子死在深夜里，死在东去的旅途之中。不过，他上车的地点却完全无法确定。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The trains which traverse the lines of rail beside which the body was found are those which run from west to east, some being purely Metropolitan, and some from Willesden and outlying junctions. it can be stated for certain that this young man, when he met his death, was travelling in this direction at some late hour of the night, but at what point he entered the train it is impossible to state.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“看看他的车票，自然可以解决这个问题。”</td>
		<td class="en">“His ticket, of course, would show that.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他的口袋里没有车票。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There was no ticket in his pockets.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没有车票！天哪，华生，这可真是怪了。根据我的经验，不出示车票是进不了地铁站台的啊。如此说来，这个小伙子应该是有票的。难道是有人拿走了车票，打算掩盖他上车的地点吗？有可能。要不然，是他自己把车票丢在车厢里了吗？也有可能。不管怎么说，这一点终归让人非常好奇。我记得现场没有抢劫的迹象，对吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“No ticket! Dear me, Watson, this is really very singular. According to my experience it is not possible to reach the platform of a Metropolitan train without exhibiting one’s ticket. Presumably, then, the young man had one. Was it taken from him in order to conceal the station from which he came? it is possible. or did he drop it in the carriage? That also is possible. But the point is of curious interest. i understand that there was no sign of robbery?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“显然是没有。这儿有一张清单，他的随身物品都列在里面。他身上有个钱包，里面装着两镑零十五先令，还有一本支票簿，抬头是都郡银行伍利奇分行，他的身份就是根据支票簿查出来的。此外还有两张事发当晚的伍利奇剧院二楼[^7]戏票，外加一小捆技术文件。 ”</td>
		<td class="en">“Apparently not. There is a list here of his possessions. His purse contained two pounds fifteen. He had also a check-book on the Woolwich branch of the Capital and Counties Bank. Through this his identity was established. There were also two dress-circle tickets for the Woolwich Theatre, dated for that very evening. Also a small packet of technical papers.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >福尔摩斯心满意足地欢呼了一声。</td>

		<td class="en">A moment later the tall and portly form of Mycroft Holmes was ushered into the room. Heavily built and massive, there was a suggestion of uncouth physical inertia in the figure, but above this unwieldy frame there was perched a head so masterful in its brow, so alert in its steel-gray, deep-set eyes, so firm in its lips, and so subtle in its play of expression, that after the first glance one forgot the gross body and remembered only the dominant mind.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >跟在他后面的是我俩在苏格兰场的那位老朋友，瘦削严肃的雷斯垂德。两个人都是脸色凝重，显然是碰上了大问题。探员走过来握了握手，一句话也没有说。迈克罗夫特·福尔摩斯则千辛万苦地脱掉大衣，慢吞吞地坐进了一把扶手椅。</td>
		<td class="en">At his heels came our old friend lestrade, of Scotland Yard—thin and austere. The gravity of both their faces foretold some weighty quest. The detective shook hands without a word. Mycroft Holmes struggled out of his overcoat and subsided into an armchair.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“A most annoying business, Sherlock,” said he. “i extremely dislike altering my habits, but the powers that be would take no denial. In the present state of Siam it is most awkward that i should be away from the office. But it is a real crisis. i have never seen the Prime Minister so upset.

		<td class="en">“Ah, there’s the point! Fortunately, it has not come out. The press would be furious if it did. The papers which this wretched youth had in his pocket were the plans of the Bruce-Partington submarine.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Its importance can hardly be exaggerated. it has been the most jealously guarded of all government secrets. You may take it from me that naval warfare becomes impossible within the radius of a Bruce-Partington’s operation. Two years ago a very large sum was smuggled through the Estimates and was expended in acquiring a monopoly of the invention. Every effort has been made to keep the secret. The plans, which are exceedingly intricate, comprising some thirty separate patents, each essential to the working of the whole, are kept in an elaborate safe in a confidential office adjoining the arsenal, with burglar-proof doors and windows. under no conceivable circumstances were the plans to be taken from the office. if the chief constructor of the navy desired to consult them, even he was forced to go to the Woolwich office for the purpose. And yet here we find them in the pocket of a dead junior clerk in the heart of london. From an official point of view it’s simply awful.”</td></tr>

The three most essential are gone— stolen, vanished. You must drop everything, Sherlock. never mind your usual petty puzzles of the police-court. It’s a vital international problem that you have to solve. Why did Cadogan West take the papers, where are the missing ones, how did he die, how came his body where it was found, how can the evil be set right?

The call must have been very pressing, since he left his girl standing in the fog and made no effort to communicate with her. our scent runs cold here, and there is a vast gap between either hypothesis and the laying of West’s body, with seven papers in his pocket, on the roof of a Metropolitan train.

		<td class="en">One of the most remarkable characteristics of Sherlock Holmes was his power of throwing his brain out of action and switching all his thoughts on to lighter things whenever he had convinced himself that he could no longer work to advantage. i remember that during the whole of that memorable day he lost himself in a monograph which he had undertaken upon the Polyphonic Motets of lassus. For my own part i had none of this power of detachment, and the day, in consequence, appeared to be interminable. The great national importance of the issue, the suspense in high quarters, the direct nature of the experiment which we were trying—all combined to work upon my nerve. it was a relief to me when at last, after a light dinner, we set out upon our expedition. lestrade and Mycroft met us by appointment at the outside of Gloucester Road Station. The area door of oberstein’s house had been left open the night before, and it was necessary for me, as Mycroft Holmes absolutely and indignantly declined to climb the railings, to pass in and open the hall door. By nine o’clock we were all seated in the study, waiting patiently for our man.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">There had been a furtive step past the door. now it returned. We heard a shuffling sound outside, and then two sharp taps with the knocker. Holmes rose, motioning to us to remain seated. The gas in the hall was a mere point of light. He opened the outer door, and then as a dark figure slipped past him he closed and fastened it. “This way!” we heard him say, and a moment later our man stood before us. Holmes had followed him closely, and as the man turned with a cry of surprise and alarm he caught him by the collar and threw him back into the room. Before our prisoner had recovered his balance the door was shut and Holmes standing with his back against it. The man glared round him, staggered, and fell senseless upon the floor. With the shock, his broad-brimmed hat flew from his head, his cravat slipped down from his lips, and there were the long light beard and the soft, handsome delicate features of Colonel Valentine Walter.</td></tr>

We are aware that you went down to the office in the fog on Monday night, but that you were seen and followed by young Cadogan West, who had probably some previous reason to suspect you. He saw your theft, but could not give the alarm, as it was just possible that you were taking the papers to your brother in london. leaving all his private concerns, like the good citizen that he was, he followed you closely in the fog and kept at your heels until you reached this very house. There he intervened, and then it was, Colonel Walter, that to treason you added the more terrible crime of murder.”</td></tr>

The young man rushed up and demanded to know what we were about to do with the papers. oberstein had a short life-preserver. He always carried it with him. As West forced his way after us into the house oberstein struck him on the head. The blow was a fatal one. He was dead within five minutes. There he lay in the hall, and we were at our wit’s end what to do. Then oberstein had this idea about the trains which halted under his back window. But first he examined the papers which I had brought. He said that three of them were essential, and that he must keep them. ‘You cannot keep them,’ said I. ‘There will be a dreadful row at Woolwich if they are not returned.’ ‘I must keep them,’ said he, ‘for they are so technical that it is impossible in the time to make copies.’ ‘Then they must all go back together to-night,’ said i. He thought for a little, and then he cried out that he had it. ‘Three I will keep,’ said he. ‘The others we will stuff into the pocket of this young man. When he is found the whole business will assuredly be put to his account.’ i could see no other way out of it, so we did as he suggested. We waited half an hour at the window before a train stopped. It was so thick that nothing could be seen, and we had no difficulty in lowering West’s body on to the train. That was the end of the matter so far as i was concerned.”</td></tr>

When i asked him if he had bought it, he answered that it was a present from a certain gracious lady in whose interests he had once been fortunate enough to carry out a small commission.
