		<td class="en">So what happened to him?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >它的主人（假如这样的牛也有个主人的话）知道它是一头了不起的好牛，不过还是觉得很伤脑筋，因为这牛老是跟别的牛斗，斗掉他非常多的钱。</td>

		<td class="en">Each bull was worth over one thousand dollars and after they had fought the great bull they were worth less than two hundred dollars and sometimes less than that.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >它的主人是个好人，他决定把这头牛的血统留在自己的牛群里，而不是把它送到斗牛场上去挨杀。</td>
		<td class="en">So the man, who was a good man, decided that he would keep the blood of this bull in all of his stock rather than send him to the ring to be killed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是他挑选这头牛来配种。</td>
		<td class="en">So he selected him for breeding.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是这头牛也真是头怪牛。</td>
		<td class="en">But this bull was a strange bull.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们第一次把这头牛赶到牧场里跟待配种的母牛呆在一起，它就看上了一头年轻俏丽的母牛。这头母牛比所有其他的母牛都要苗条，肌肉更发达，皮毛更有光泽，也更可爱。</td>
		<td class="en">When they first turned him into the pasture with the breeding cows, he saw one who was young and beautiful and slimmer and better muscled and shinier and more lovely than all the others.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >既然不能斗，它就爱上了这头母牛，对其他的母牛一眼也不瞧。</td>
		<td class="en">So, since he could not fight, he fell in love with her and he paid no attention to any of the others.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >它只想跟她呆在一起，对其他的母牛根本不屑一顾。</td>
		<td class="en">He only wanted to be with her, and the others meant nothing to him at all.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >养牛的牧场主本来还希望这头牛会有所转变，开点儿窍，哪怕是和以前相比有一点儿不同也好。</td>
		<td class="en">The man who owned the bull ranch hoped that the bull would change, or learn, or be different than he was.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是这头牛依然不变，它就只爱自己爱的那头母牛，心无旁骛。</td>
		<td class="en">But the bull was the same and he loved whom he loved and no one else.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >它只想跟她在一起，对其他的母牛根本不屑一顾。</td>
		<td class="en">He only wanted to be with her, and the others meant nothing to him at all.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >正因如此，它的主人把它和另外五头公牛一起送到斗牛场去挨杀。尽管它对母牛忠贞不二，在斗牛场上它还是有两下子的。</td>
		<td class="en">So the man sent him away with five other bulls to be killed in the ring, and at least the bull could fight, even though he was faithful.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >它搏斗得很精彩，所有的人都钦佩它，最钦佩它的还要数那个杀了它的人。</td>
		<td class="en">He fought wonderfully and everyone admired him and the man who killed him admired him the most.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >杀它的那个人（大家都叫它“斗牛士”）穿的战衣到最后都湿透了，嘴巴也干得厉害。</td>
		<td class="en">But the fighting jacket of the man who killed him and who is called the matador was wet through by the end, and his mouth was very dry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这头牛真是勇敢极了。”斗牛士边说边把剑递给自己的助手。</td>
		<td class="en">“Que toro más bravo,” the matador said as he handed his sword to his sword handler.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他递剑的时候剑柄朝着上方，剑锋上还滴着从这头勇敢的公牛心脏里流出的鲜血。这头牛不会再遇到任何困难了，此刻它正被四匹马拖出场外。</td>
		<td class="en">He handed it with the hilt up and the blade dripping with the blood from the heart of the brave bull who no longer had any problems of any kind and was being dragged out of the ring by four horses.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是啊。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >它就是比利亚马约侯爵想要打发掉的那头牛，因为它对一头母牛忠贞不渝。”那个无所不知的助手说道。</td>
		<td class="en">He was the one the Marqués of Villamayor had to get rid of because he was faithful,” the sword handler, who knew everything, said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“也许我们都应该像它一样忠贞不渝。”斗牛士说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Perhaps we should all be faithful.” the matador said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" ></td>
		<td class="en"></td></tr>
