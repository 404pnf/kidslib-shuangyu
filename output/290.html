		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在莫斯科一条偏僻的街上有一座灰色的房子：白色的柱子，歪歪扭扭的阳台。这里曾经住着一位太太，她是一个拥有很多家奴的老寡妇。太太的儿子们是远在彼得堡工作的公务人员，女儿们也皆已成家。她很少出门，就这样，她孤独、吝啬、乏味地过着自己的晚年生活。她早已不再年轻，之前的生活沉闷而无趣，而晚年的时光却比黑夜更加暗淡无光。</td>
		<td class="en">In one of the outlying streets of Moscow, in a grey house with white columns and a balcony, warped all askew, there was once living a lady, a widow, surrounded by a numerous household of serfs.Her sons were in the government service at Petersburg; her daughters were married; she went out very little, and in solitude lived through the last years of her miserly and dreary old age.Her day, a joyless and gloomy day, had long been over; but the evening of her life was blacker than night.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在她的所有家奴中，最出众的是一个名叫格拉西姆的看门人。此人身材高大，比常人足足高出十二英寸，身体健壮，但却先天性聋哑。格拉西姆独自住在乡下的一间小茅草屋里，弟兄们都各过各的了。太太是从乡下把他带到莫斯科的，他可是太太所有的农奴中交地租最准时的一个。他天生力大无穷，干起活来一个人能顶四个人、十分麻利。看他干活是一件很有趣的事：犁地时，他用他那双大手往犁上用力一压，仿佛无需他那可怜的马的帮助就能独自犁开大地那柔软的胸怀；过圣彼得节时，他挥动着镰刀，那劲头好像可以把一颗小白桦树连根砍断；他可以轻快而不知疲倦地连续挥舞着两码长的连枷，而他那坚实的臂膀上的肌腱也如杠杆似的上下起伏。永久的沉默加之他不知疲倦的劳作更显得他是那么严肃而有尊严。他是一个非常棒的农奴，如果不是先天性残疾的话，哪一位农家女孩会不想嫁给他呢……但是如今，他们把格拉西姆带到了莫斯科，让他穿上了靴子，夏有长衫，冬有羊皮袄，给了他一把扫帚和铁锹，指派他去看门。</td>
		<td class="en">Of all her servants, the most remarkable personage was the porter, Gerasim, a man full twelve inches over the normal height, of heroic build, and deaf and dumb from his birth.The lady, his owner, had brought him up from the village where he lived alone in a little hut, apart from his brothers, and was reckoned about the most punctual of her peasants in the payment of the seignorial dues.Endowed with extraordinary strength, he did the work of four men; work flew apace under his hands, and it was a pleasant sight to see him when he was ploughing, while, with his huge palms pressing hard upon the plough, he seemed alone, unaided by his poor horse, to cleave the yeilding bosom of the earth, or when, about St. Peter’s Day, he plied his scythe with a furious energy that might have mown a young birch copse up by the roots, or swiftly and untiringly wielded a flail over two yards long; while the hard oblong muscles of his shoulders rose and fell like a lever.His perpetual silence lent a solemn dignity to his unwearying labour.He was a splendid peasant, and, except for his affliction, any girl would have been glad to marry him....But now they had taken Gerasim to Moscow, bought him boots, had him made a full-skirted coat for summer, a sheepskin for winter, put into his hand a broom and a spade, and appointed him porter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >起初，他对他的新生活非常厌恶。从小他就习惯了农田里的庄稼活，习惯了乡下的生活。由于先天性的残疾，他与世隔绝，长大后，他沉默不语却强壮无比，如同长在沃土上的一棵大树。被带到城里之后，他无法搞清楚自己的处境。他迷茫、忧郁，如同一头健壮却惊慌失措的小牛，从一片长满齐胸高的嫩草地上被硬生生地拉了出来，装上了车；它强壮的身躯被烟雾、火焰和蒸汽所遮掩，只能任凭喧嚣的火车把它晃晃悠悠地带向前方，至于被带到哪里——天知道！比起以前的农活，格拉西姆现在的工作对他来说只能算是零星的碎活。每天他用半个小时就能把所有的活干完，然后便又一动不动地立在院子中央，张着嘴，看着过往的行人，好像从他们身上可以得出他为什么会落入如此困境的答案。有时，他会突然冲进某个角落里，把扫帚和铲子用力往远处一扔，脸向下扑倒在地，就这样静静地趴上好几个小时，像笼子中的野兽一般。但是，人是可以适应任何东西的，格拉西姆最终也适应了他在城里的生活。指派给他的活并不多，无非就是保持院落的清洁，一天运两次水，一次一桶，劈柴并搬运到厨房和室内供大家使用，防止陌生人进入宅院以及守夜。但应该说，他干活时是充满热情的。在他的院子里，从来不会有一点木屑、一丝灰尘。雨天，如果可怜的老马由他驾着来打水，拉着水车陷在路上，他会很轻松地用肩膀一推，连车带马便脱离了困境。他劈柴的时候，斧头就像劈在玻璃上一样发出清脆的声音，同时木屑和木块也四处飞溅。至于防止陌生人进入宅院的活，一天晚上他逮住了两个小偷，然后便抓住他们俩的脑袋互相一撞，由于用劲过大，也省去了交送警察局的麻烦。从那以后，周围邻居没有一个不佩服他的，甚至当白天有人来访，看见这个厉害的看门人时都会冲他挥手大叫，仿佛他可以听见他们的叫声，尽管他们不是盗贼而仅仅是陌生人。对于其他仆人，格拉西姆仅仅表示友好而不深交——他们都害怕他——但他把他们当成自己人。他们利用手势跟他交流，他都能懂得他们的意思并能正确无误地按吩咐办事，同时他也知道自己的权利，很快，在吃饭时，就没有一个人胆敢霸占他的座位了。格拉西姆是个既严谨又严肃的人，他喜欢按规矩办事。甚至连公鸡都不敢在他面前打架，否则它们就会遭殃。一旦被他看到，他便会抓住鸡腿，如同转动轮子一样在空中转上十来圈，然后把它们抛向四面八方。院子里还养着鹅。众所周知，鹅是高贵、明理的家禽，格拉西姆对它们格外敬重，悉心照顾着、喂养着它们，而他自己就像一只来自大草原的公鹅。他被分配住在厨房之上的一间小阁楼里，并随其所愿地装饰他的小窝。他做了一张橡木床板，用四块木头当作床腿——这真是个大家伙，简直可以承受一到两吨的重量，而不会弯曲。床下放着一个坚实的箱子，墙角倚着一张同样坚实的小桌，桌子旁边有一个三只腿的凳子，它坚实却矮胖，格拉西姆常常笑眯眯地把它拿起来看看，然后又放下。阁楼用一把挂锁锁着，锁子形似圆弧形的面包或者篮子状的面包，只不过锁子是黑色的；格拉西姆总是把钥匙挂在腰带上，随身携带。他不喜欢别人去他的阁楼。</td>
		<td class="en">At first he intensely disliked his new mode of life.From his childhood he had been used to field labour, to village life.Shut off by his affliction from the society of men, he had grown up, dumb and mighty, as a tree grows on a fruitful soil.When he was transported to the town, he could not understand what was being done with him; he was miserable and stupefied, with the stupefaction of some strong young bull, taken straight from the meadow, where the rich grass stood up to his belly, taken and put in the truck of a railway train, and there, while smoke and sparks and gusts of steam puff out upon the sturdy beast, he is whirled onwards, whirled along with loud roar and whistle, whither—God knows!What Gerasim had to do in his new duties seemed a mere trifle to him after his hard toil as a peasant; in half-an-hour, all his work was done, and he would once more stand stock-still in the middle of the courtyard, staring open-mouthed at all the passers-by, as though trying to wrest from them the explanation of his perplexing position; or he would suddenly go off into some corner, and flinging a long way off the broom or the spade, throw himself on his face on the ground, and lie for hours together without stirring, like a caged beast.But man gets used to anything, and Gerasim got used at last to living in town.He had little work to do; his whole duty consisted in keeping the courtyard clean, bringing in a barrel of water twice a day, splitting and dragging in wood for the kitchen and the house, keeping out strangers, and watching at night.And it must be said he did his duty zealously.In his courtyard there was never a shaving lying about, never a speck of dust; if sometimes, in the muddy season, the wretched nag, put under his charge for fetching water, got stuck in the road, he would simply give it a shove with his shoulder, and set not only the cart but the horse itself moving.If he set to chopping wood, the axe fairly rang like glass, and chips and chunks flew in all directions.And as for strangers, after he had one night caught two thieves and knocked their heads together—knocked them so that there was not the slightest need to take them to the police-station afterwards—every one in the neighbourhood began to feel a great respect for him; even those who came in the day-time, by no means robbers, but simply unknown persons, at the sight of the terrible porter, waved and shouted to him as though he could hear their shouts.With all the rest of the servants, Gerasim was on terms, hardly friendly—they were afraid of him—but familiar; he regarded them as his fellows.They explained themselves to him by signs, and he understood them, and exactly carried out all orders, but knew his own rights too, and soon no one dared to take his seat at the table.Gerasim was altogether of a strict and serious temper, he liked order in everything; even the cocks did not dare to fight in his presence, or woe betide them!Directly, he caught sight of them, he would seize them by the legs, swing them ten times round in the air like a wheel, and throw them in different directions.There were geese, too, kept in the yard; but the goose, as is well known, is a dignified and reasonable bird; Gerasim felt a respect for them, looked after them, and fed them; he was himself not unlike a gander of the steppes.He was assigned a little garret over the kitchen; he arranged it himself to his own liking, made a bedstead in it of oak boards on four stumps of wood for legs—a truly Titanic bedstead; one might have put a ton or two on it—it would not have bent under the load; under the bed was a solid chest; in a corner stood a little table of the same strong kind, and near the table a three-legged stool, so solid and squat that Gerasim himself would sometimes pick it up and drop it again with a smile of delight.The garret was locked up by means of a padlock that looked like a kalatch or basket-shaped loaf, only black; the key of this padlock Gerasim always carried about him in his girdle.He did not like people to come to his garret.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这样一年过去了，年末的时候，格拉西姆遇到了一件意外的事。</td>
		<td class="en">So passed a year, at the end of which a little incident befell Gerasim.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >格拉西姆是个看门人，他所伺候的女主人喜欢按老规矩办事，她有很多仆人。在她房子里不仅有洗衣女工、缝衣妇、木匠、男女裁缝，甚至还有马具匠（同时也充当兽医）、为仆人看病的大夫，还有专门为女主人看病的大夫，最后还有一个名叫卡皮通·克里莫夫的鞋匠，他是一个嗜酒如命的人。克里莫夫总觉得自己受到了伤害，才能得不到赏识。可以这么说，他觉得自己本是一个来自彼得堡的、有教养的人，却沦落到了莫斯科的一个荒蛮之处，还找不到一份像样的工作。如果他喝了酒，他便把原因归结于伤心过度，并捶胸顿足地反复强调。所以，一天他的女主人就和她的管家谈到了他。管家名叫加夫里拉，从他那小小的黄眼睛和如同鸭嘴的鼻子上就能看出他是个天生就很会发号施令的人。太太对卡皮通的自甘堕落觉得有些惋惜，就在前天夜里他还因醉倒在街的某处而被拖了回来。</td>
		<td class="en">The old lady, in whose service he lived as porter, adhered in everything to the ancient ways, and kept a large number of servants.In her house were not only laundresses, sempstresses, carpenters, tailors and tailoresses, there was even a harness-maker—he was reckoned as a veterinary surgeon, too,—and a doctor for the servants; there was a household doctor for the mistress; there was, lastly, a shoemaker, by name Kapiton Klimov, a sad drunkard.Klimov regarded himself as an injured creature, whose merits were unappreciated, a cultivated man from Petersburg, who ought not to be living in Moscow without occupation—in the wilds, so to speak; and if he drank, as he himself expressed it emphatically, with a blow on his chest, it was sorrow drove him to it.So one day his mistress had a conversation about him with her head steward, Gavrila, a man whom, judging solely from his little yellow eyes and nose like a duck’s beak, fate itself, it seemed, had marked out as a person in authority.The lady expressed her regret at the corruption of the morals of Kapiton, who had, only the evening before, been picked up somewhere in the street.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Returning to his own room (it was in a little lodge, and was almost filled up with metal-bound trunks), Gavrila first sent his wife away, and then sat down at the window and pondered.His mistress’s unexpected arrangement had clearly put him in a difficulty.At last he got up and sent to call Kapiton.Kapiton made his appearance....But before reporting their conversation to the reader, we consider it not out of place to relate in few words who was this Tatiana, whom it was to be Kapiton’s lot to marry, and why the great lady’s order had disturbed the steward.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >塔蒂亚娜是上面提到的洗衣女工之一（因为她技艺娴熟，所以专负责洗上好的亚麻质地的衣物），她二十八岁，身体瘦弱，一头金发，左脸颊上有几颗痣。在俄国，左脸长痣被认为是凶兆，象征着命不好。塔蒂亚娜可一点也不幸运。从小她就受人虐待：一个人得干两个人的活，没有人对她有一丝的同情，她的衣服破烂不堪，拿到的工资也少得可怜。她几乎没有亲戚，她以前有个叔叔，曾经做过管事，但后来因为不中用了，所以被遣回了乡下。她还有几个叔叔、舅舅，可是他们却都是农奴——除此之外，别无他人。她也曾是个美人，但美貌却如昙花一现，转瞬即逝。她性情温顺，或者说软弱更为贴切；她对自己漠不关心，对他人害怕至极；除了怎样按时把她的活干完，别的她什么都不想，她也从来不与任何人交谈，一听到女主人的名字，她便瑟瑟发抖，尽管她的女主人还未必认识她。当格拉西姆从乡下被带来时，第一眼看到他那魁梧的身躯，她就差点被吓晕了过去，之后她便想尽一切办法避免撞见格拉西姆。有时她急着从房间赶到洗衣房，偶尔从他身边经过时，她甚至会闭着眼睛跑过去。起初，格拉西姆并未注意到她。渐渐地，当塔蒂亚娜从他旁边经过时，他便开始展现笑意。后来他开始有些爱慕地盯着她看。最后，他再也不愿把目光从她身上移开。她使他着迷，这是由于她那温和的表情还是因为她那带有怯意的举止呢？——谁知道呢？一天，正当她小心翼翼地用张开的手掌托着太太刚浆洗过的晨衣，从院中悄悄走过时——突然，有人用力拉住了她的臂肘，她扭头看去，大声地尖叫起来，原来站在她身后的是格拉西姆。他傻笑着，一边咿咿呀呀地表示对她的好感，一边把一只尾巴和翅膀上饰有金边的公鸡姜饼递给了她。她不愿收下，但格拉西姆却把姜饼硬塞到她手里，摇着头就要走开，然后又转过头来，咿咿呀呀地说了些什么，以示对她的好感。从那以后，他便搅得她不能安宁，无论她到哪，他都会立马出现来见她，笑着，不清楚地咿咿呀呀，向她挥着手。他会突然地从他的衣服兜里掏出一条丝带，塞到她手里，或者用扫帚将她前方路上的灰尘扫去。可怜的女孩简直不知道该怎么办才好。很快，全院人都看出了哑巴看门人的意图，于是戏弄、嘲笑、调侃的话向塔蒂亚娜接踵而来。然而却没有人敢开格拉西姆的玩笑，因为他不喜欢开玩笑，事实上，当格拉西姆在塔蒂亚娜旁边时，也没人敢开她的玩笑。不论女孩愿不愿意，她发现自己已经在他的保护之下。他同其他聋哑人一样多疑，一旦有人嘲笑他或塔蒂亚娜时，他都会立即觉察到。有一次在吃午饭的时候，管理太太衣物的婆娘（塔蒂亚娜的上司）像大家所称的那样，对塔蒂亚娜唠叨个不停，使得这个小可怜不知道该看哪里，羞恼得几乎哭了出来。突然，格拉西姆站了起来，伸出他的大手，抓住了管衣婆的头，十分凶狠地看着她的脸，以致于吓得她把头都碰到了饭桌上。这时所有的人都惊呆了。随后，格拉西姆又拿起了他的汤勺，继续喝他的菜汤。“看他，真是个哑巴恶魔，树怪！”他们都低声细语道，而管衣婆却站了起来，回佣人的房间去了。又有一次，格拉西姆发现卡皮通——就是上文我们所提到的那个卡皮通——正在与塔蒂亚娜搭讪，且态度太过专注，于是他便打手势让卡皮通过去，把他带到了车棚。然后他拿了一根立在墙角的棍子威胁卡皮通，动作虽然不大，但却非常奏效。从那以后，再也没有人敢和塔蒂亚娜闲聊了。而这些事却未给格拉西姆造成丝毫影响。那次管衣婆一回到佣人的房间就晕倒了，她还十分巧妙地在同一天把格拉西姆对她动粗的事传到了女主人的耳朵里。不过他们的女主人是个做事随心所欲的人，她听说了这件事后，只是把它当作了笑料，并且让管衣婆极为难堪的是，太太曾几次迫使她一遍遍地讲述格拉西姆是如何用手按倒她的头的。次日，太太给了格拉西姆一卢布作为奖励。她赞赏这个看门人，觉得他身体强壮而又忠实可靠。格拉西姆对他的女主人特别敬畏，但是与此同时，他又希望得到太太的赏识，并且他正准备去求太太把塔蒂亚娜嫁给他，并带她离开这里。万事俱备，就差管家曾答应给他的一件新外套，因为他想在太太面前表现得更得体些，谁知这位女主人却突发奇想地要把塔蒂亚娜嫁给卡皮通。</td>
		<td class="en">Tatiana, one of the laundresses referred to above (as a trained and skilful laundress she was in charge of the fine linen only), was a woman of twenty-eight, thin, fair-haired, with moles on her left cheek.Moles on the left cheek are regarded as of evil omen in Russia—a token of unhappy life....Tatiana could not boast of her good luck.From her earliest youth she had been badly treated—she had done the work of two, and had never known affection; she had been poorly clothed and had received the smallest wages.Relations she had practically none; an uncle she had once had, a butler, left behind in the country as useless, and other uncles of hers were peasants—that was all.At one time she had passed for a beauty, but her good looks were very soon over.In disposition, she was very meek, or, rather, scared; towards herself, she felt perfect indifference; of others, she stood in mortal dread; she thought of nothing but how to get her work done in good time, never talked to any one, and trembled at the very name of her mistress, though the latter scarcely knew her by sight.When Gerasim was brought from the country, she was ready to die with fear on seeing his huge figure, tried all she could to avoid meeting him, even dropped her eyelids when sometimes she chanced to run past him, hurrying from the house to the laundry.Gerasim at first paid no special attention to her, then he used to smile when she came his way, then he began even to stare admiringly at her, and at last he never took his eyes off her.She took his fancy, whether by the mild expression of her face or the timidity of her movements, who can tell?So one day she was stealing across the yard, with a starched dressing-jacket of her mistress’s carefully poised on her outspread fingers... some one suddenly grasped her vigorously by the elbow; she turned round and fairly screamed; behind her stood Gerasim.With a foolish smile, making inarticulate caressing grunts, he held out to her a gingerbread cock with gold tinsel on his tail and wings.She was about to refuse it, but he thrust it forcibly into her hand, shook his head, walked away, and turning round, once more grunted something very affectionately to her.From that day forward he gave her no peace; wherever she went, he was on the spot at once, coming to meet her, smiling, grunting, waving his hands; all at once he would pull a ribbon out of the bosom of his smock and put it in her hand, or would sweep the dust out of her way.The poor girl simply did not know how to behave or what to do.Soon the whole household knew of the dumb porter’s wiles; jeers, jokes, sly hints were showered upon Tatiana.At Gerasim, however, it was not every one who would dare to scoff; he did not like jokes; indeed, in his presence, she, too, was left in peace.Whether she liked it or not, the girl found herself to be under his protection.Like all deaf-mutes, he was very suspicious, and very readily perceived when they were laughing at him or at her.One day, at dinner, the wardrobe-keeper, Tatiana’s superior, fell to nagging, as it is called, at her, and brought the poor thing to such a state that she did not know where to look, and was almost crying with vexation.Gerasim got up all of a sudden, stretched out his gigantic hand, laid it on the wardrobe-maid’s head, and looked into her face with such grim ferocity that her head positively flopped upon the table.Every one was still.Gerasim took up his spoon again and went on with his cabbage-soup.‘Look at him, the dumb devil, the wood-demon!’ they all muttered in under-tones, while the wardrobe-maid got up and went out into the maids’ room.Another time, noticing that Kapiton—the same Kapiton who was the subject of the conversation reported above—was gossiping somewhat too attentively with Tatiana, Gerasim beckoned him to him, led him into the cartshed, and taking up a shaft that was standing in a corner by one end, lightly, but most significantly, menaced him with it.Since then no one addressed a word to Tatiana.And all this cost him nothing.It is true the wardrobe-maid, as soon as she reached the maids’ room, promptly fell into a fainting-fit, and behaved altogether so skilfully that Gerasim’s rough action reached his mistress’s knowledge the same day.But the capricious old lady only laughed, and several times, to the great offence of the wardrobe-maid, forced her to repeat ‘how he bent your head down with his heavy hand,’ and next day she sent Gerasim a rouble.She looked on him with favour as a strong and faithful watchman.Gerasim stood in considerable awe of her, but, all the same, he had hopes of her favour, and was preparing to go to her with a petition for leave to marry Tatiana.He was only waiting for a new coat, promised him by the steward, to present a proper appearance before his mistress, when this same mistress suddenly took it into her head to marry Tatiana to Kapiton.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >读者现在应该能搞清楚，为什么女主人与管家加夫里拉的谈话会使管家很为难了吧。“太太是很喜欢格拉西姆的，这是明摆着的。”管家坐在窗户旁想着（加夫里拉对此了如指掌，因此他对待格拉西姆也较为宽松），“但不管怎样，他毕竟不会说话。事实上，我总不能告诉太太他也喜欢塔蒂亚娜吧。况且，不可否认，他会是一个奇怪的丈夫。但是，另一方面，如果那个怪物——愿上帝宽恕——知道了他们要把塔蒂亚娜嫁给卡皮通，他会把房子全拆了的，我敢发誓，这是绝对的！跟他没办法说理，因为他是个怪物，愿上帝宽恕我的罪过，不论怎么解释他都不会罢休的，绝对不会！我敢发誓！”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，事情并没有像管家预想的那样发展。太太对卡皮通的婚事特别热衷，甚至在与她的译名女伴晚间闲聊时，也是说的这个话题。这个女伴的工作就是在太太失眠的时候陪太太聊天、解闷，如同夜间值班的马夫一样，白天睡觉晚上工作。第二天早茶后，当加夫里拉来向太太禀报家事时，她第一句就问道：“我们说的那桩婚事怎么样了，进行得还顺利吗？”他回答说，当然，顺利极了，今天卡皮通会当面来向太太致谢的。太太身体不太好，她不能长时间地处理事务。管家退回到自己房间后，召开了一个会议。这件事的确需要引起足够的重视了。当然，塔蒂亚娜那边不会有什么阻力，然而卡皮通却当众声称他只有一个脑袋可以丢，而不是两三个……格拉西姆愤怒地用眼睛扫了一遍房里的每一个人，不愿从女佣房间的台阶上走开，仿佛他已经猜到了，他们在策划一个对他不利的阴谋。人都到齐了。其中包括一个专管饮食的老侍从，外号“尾巴大叔”，大家都很尊敬他，愿意找他商量事情，尽管他的回答总是：“这个不错！没错，对呀，对呀！”为了防止意外，大家采取了预防性安全措施，把卡皮通锁在了一个储存过滤器的木房子里。接下来，大家就是认认真真地考虑这个问题，当然，采取武力是最容易的方法。可是这怎么能行得通呢！这样的话会弄得鸡犬不宁，会打扰到太太——那就麻烦了！他们该怎么办？他们想了又想，最终找到了一个办法。他们曾经许多次发现格拉西姆十分厌恶喝醉酒的人。当他坐在大门边，看到喝醉酒的人经过时，这些人走起路来左摇右晃，帽子还歪到了一边，他往往会非常厌恶地把头扭到一边，。他们的办法是让塔蒂亚娜假装喝醉了，踉踉跄跄地、左摇右摆地从格拉西姆旁边走过。可怜的女孩在很长一段时间里都拒绝这么做，但最后他们终于说服了她。她也知道这是摆脱她这个爱慕者的唯一可能的方法。于是她走了出去。卡皮通也从木房子里被放了出来，毕竟，他与此事有直接的联系。这时，格拉西姆坐在大门旁的一块石头上，用铁锹砍着地……其他人都躲在角落里或窗帘后面悄悄地注视着格拉西姆的一举一动……这个办法的成效超乎想象。起先，格拉西姆一看到塔蒂亚娜，便跟往常一样点着头，嘴里还咿咿呀呀地叫着，向她表示好感。但随后他仔细看了看她，把铲子一扔，一跃而起，径直走到她面前，把脸朝她的脸凑了过去……由于害怕，塔蒂亚娜更加站立不稳，紧紧地闭上了眼睛……他拽着她的胳膊迅速地穿过了院子，进了他们刚才开会的那个房间，然后把她直接推到了卡皮通的身上。塔蒂亚娜简直昏了过去……格拉西姆站在那里，看着她，挥了挥手，笑了一下，便脚步沉重地走开了，回自己的阁楼去了……接下来的一天一夜，他都没有从阁楼里走出来。后来，马夫安提普卡说他从墙缝里看见格拉西姆一个人坐在床架上，用手托着脸。他不时地发出轻柔而有规律的声音，他在唱悲歌，他闭着眼睛，身体前后摇晃着，摇着头，如同车夫或者水手们唱着忧郁的歌曲的样子。安提普卡再也看不下去了，便从裂缝边走开了。第二天，当格拉西姆从阁楼里出来后，大家都没有发现什么异样。唯一不同的是他好像比以前更阴郁了，并且对塔蒂亚娜和卡皮通都不闻不问。同一天晚上，塔蒂亚娜和卡皮通都胳膊下夹着鹅，当面向他们的女主人致谢去了，一周后便是他们的婚期。即使在婚礼的当天，格拉西姆也没有表现出跟往常不一样的举动。只是，他去河边打水却没有带水回来，在途中，他不知怎么把水桶弄坏了。晚上，他去马棚刷马，由于太过用劲，马匹在他的铁拳下就像风中的草叶一样站立不稳，晃来晃去。</td>
		<td class="en">Meanwhile, the steward’s anticipations were not fulfilled.The old lady was so much taken up with the idea of Kapiton’s wedding, that even in the night she talked of nothing else to one of her companions, who was kept in her house solely to entertain her in case of sleeplessness, and, like a night cabman, slept in the day.When Gavrila came to her after morning tea with his report, her first question was: ‘And how about our wedding—is it getting on all right?’He replied, of course, that it was getting on first rate, and that Kapiton would appear before her to pay his reverence to her that day.The old lady was not quite well; she did not give much time to business.The steward went back to his own room, and called a council.The matter certainly called for serious consideration.Tatiana would make no difficulty, of course; but Kapiton had declared in the hearing of all that he had but one head to lose, not two or three....Gerasim turned rapid sullen looks on every one, would not budge from the steps of the maids’ quarters, and seemed to guess that some mischief was being hatched against him.They met together.Among them was an old sideboard waiter, nicknamed Uncle Tail, to whom every one looked respectfully for counsel, though all they got out of him was, ‘Here’s a pretty pass! to be sure, to be sure, to be sure!’As a preliminary measure of security, to provide against contingencies, they locked Kapiton up in the lumber-room where the filter was kept; then considered the question with the gravest deliberation, It would, to be sure, be easy to have recourse to force.But Heaven save us! there would be an uproar, the mistress would be put out—it would be awful!What should they do?They thought and thought, and at last thought out a solution.It had many a time been observed that Gerasim could not bear drunkards....As he sat at the gates, he would always turn away with disgust when some one passed by intoxicated, with unsteady steps and his cap on one side of his ear.They resolved that Tatiana should be instructed to pretend to be tipsy, and should pass by Gerasim staggering and reeling about.The poor girl refused for a long while to agree to this, but they persuaded her at last; she saw, too, that it was the only possible way of getting rid of her adorer.She went out.Kapiton was released from the lumber-room; for, after all, he had an interest in the affair.Gerasim was sitting on the curb-stone at the gates, scraping the ground with a spade....From behind every corner, from behind every window-blind, the others were watching him....The trick succeeded beyond all expectations.On seeing Tatiana, at first, he nodded as usual, making caressing, inarticulate sounds; then he looked carefully at her, dropped his spade, jumped up, went up to her, brought his face close to her face....In her fright she staggered more than ever, and shut her eyes....He took her by the arm, whirled her right across the yard, and going into the room where the council had been sitting, pushed her straight at Kapiton.Tatiana fairly swooned away....Gerasim stood, looked at her, waved his hand, laughed, and went off, stepping heavily, to his garret....For the next twenty-four hours, he did not come out of it.The postillion Antipka said afterwards that he saw Gerasim through a crack in the wall, sitting on his bedstead, his face in his hand.From time to time he uttered soft regular sounds; he was wailing a dirge, that is, swaying backwards and forwards with his eyes shut, and shaking his head as drivers or bargemen do when they chant their melancholy songs.Antipka could not bear it, and he came away from the crack.When Gerasim came out of the garret next day, no particular change could be observed in him.He only seemed, as it were, more morose, and took not the slightest notice of Tatiana or Kapiton.The same evening, they both had to appear before their mistress with geese under their arms, and in a week’s time they were married.Even on the day of the wedding Gerasim showed no change of any sort in his behaviour.Only, he came back from the river without water, he had somehow broken the barrel on the road; and at night, in the stable, he washed and rubbed down his horse so vigorously, that it swayed like a blade of grass in the wind, and staggered from one leg to the other under his fists of iron.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">No mother could have looked after her baby as Gerasim looked after his little nursling.At first, she—for the pup turned out to be a bitch—was very weak, feeble, and ugly, but by degrees she grew stronger and improved in looks, and thanks to the unflagging care of her preserver, in eight months’ time she was transformed into a very pretty dog of the spaniel breed, with long ears, a bushy spiral tail, and large expressive eyes.She was devotedly attached to Gerasim, and was never a yard from his side; she always followed him about wagging her tail.He had even given her a name—the dumb know that their inarticulate noises call the attention of others.He called her Mumu.All the servants in the house liked her, and called her Mumu, too.She was very intelligent, she was friendly with every one, but was only fond of Gerasim.Gerasim, on his side, loved her passionately, and he did not like it when other people stroked her; whether he was afraid for her, or jealous—God knows!She used to wake him in the morning, pulling at his coat; she used to take the reins in her mouth, and bring him up the old horse that carried the water, with whom she was on very friendly terms.With a face of great importance, she used to go with him to the river; she used to watch his brooms and spades, and never allowed any one to go into his garret.He cut a little hole in his door on purpose for her, and she seemed to feel that only in Gerasim’s garret she was completely mistress and at home; and directly she went in, she used to jump with a satisfied air upon the bed.At night she did not sleep at all, but she never barked without sufficient cause, like some stupid house-dog, who, sitting on its hind-legs, blinking, with its nose in the air, barks simply from dulness, at the stars, usually three times in succession.No! Mumu’s delicate little voice was never raised without good reason; either some stranger was passing close to the fence, or there was some suspicious sound or rustle somewhere....In fact, she was an excellent watch-dog.It is true that there was another dog in the yard, a tawny old dog with brown spots, called Wolf, but he was never, even at night, let off the chain; and, indeed, he was so decrepit that he did not even wish for freedom.He used to lie curled up in his kennel, and only rarely uttered a sleepy, almost noiseless bark, which broke off at once, as though he were himself aware of its uselessness.Mumu never went into the mistress’s house; and when Gerasim carried wood into the rooms, she always stayed behind, impatiently waiting for him at the steps, pricking up her ears and turning her head to right and to left at the slightest creak of the door....</td></tr>

		<td class="en">It was dark by the time he came back.From his worn-out look, his unsteady walk, and his dusty clothes, it might be surmised that he had been running over half Moscow.He stood still opposite the windows of the mistress‘ house, took a searching look at the steps where a group of house-serfs were crowded together, turned away, and uttered once more his inarticulate ‘Mumu.’Mumu did not answer.He went away.Every one looked after him, but no one smiled or said a word, and the inquisitive postillion Antipka reported next morning in the kitchen that the dumb man had been groaning all night.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那一天，格拉西姆一直都没出现，于是他们只好让车夫波塔普代他去打水，为此波塔普很是不乐意。太太问加夫里拉她的指令是否已经执行。加夫里拉回答说已经办妥了。第二天早上，格拉西姆走出了阁楼，开始工作。他来吃午饭，吃完后又出去了，没有向任何人打招呼。和所有聋哑人一样，他的脸本来没有一丝表情，可如今却僵硬得像一块石头。他吃完饭又出了院子，但没过多久就回来了，径直去了草棚。深夜来临，空中挂着一轮明月。格拉西姆躺在那里，哀叹不已，辗转反侧。突然，他觉得有什么东西在拽他的衣角。他吓了一跳，却没抬头，甚至把眼睛闭得更紧。但接着又是一拽，比以前更有力了，他跳起来……出现在面前的正是木木，它来回打着转，脖子上还拴着一节绳子。格拉西姆从无声的心底处爆发出一声长长的、喜悦的叫喊，他抓起木木，紧紧地抱着它。木木也舔着他的鼻子、眼睛、胡子。一切都发生在一瞬间……他站在那里，想了一会儿，十分谨慎地从草棚出来，环顾四周，确保没人看到他后，这才满意地回到阁楼。格拉西姆先前就猜到木木是不会自己走丢的，肯定是太太下令把它带走的。因为有仆人曾向他比划说木木咬了太太。于是，格拉西姆决定采取行动。他先是喂了木木点面包，抚摸着它，把它放在床上。接着就陷入了沉思，他整晚都在想怎样才能最恰当地把它藏好。最终，他决定白天让它呆在阁楼里，只是偶尔回来看它，晚上才把它带出去。他用一件旧外套把门上的那个洞堵得严严实实的，天不亮就到了院子，好像什么事都没有发生一样——真是天真的小把戏！——脸上依然挂着同样忧郁的表情。</td>
		<td class="en">All the next day Gerasim did not show himself, so that they were obliged to send the coachman Potap for water instead of him, at which the coachman Potap was anything but pleased.The lady asked Gavrila if her orders had been carried out.Gavrila replied that they had.The next morning Gerasim came out of his garret, and went about his work.He came in to his dinner, ate it, and went out again, without a greeting to any one.His face, which had always been lifeless, as with all deaf-mutes, seemed now to be turned to stone.After dinner he went out of the yard again, but not for long; he came back, and went straight up to the hay-loft.Night came on, a clear moonlight night.Gerasim lay breathing heavily, and incessantly turning from side to side.Suddenly he felt something pull at the skirt of his coat.He started, but did not raise his head, and even shut his eyes tighter.But again there was a pull, stronger than before; he jumped up… before him, with an end of string round her neck, was Mumu, twisting and turning.A prolonged cry of delight broke from his speechless breast; he caught up Mumu, and hugged her tight in his arms, she licked his nose and eyes, and beard and moustache, all in one instant....He stood a little, thought a minute, crept cautiously down from the hay-loft, looked round, and having satisfied himself that no one could see him, made his way successfully to his garret.Gerasim had guessed before that his dog had not got lost by her own doing, that she must have been taken away by the mistress’ orders; the servants had explained to him by signs that his Mumu had snapped at her, and he determined to take his own measures.First he fed Mumu with a bit of bread, fondled her, and put her to bed, then he fell to meditating, and spent the whole night long in meditating how he could best conceal her.At last he decided to leave her all day in the garret, and only to come in now and then to see her, and to take her out at night.The hole in the door he stopped up effectually with his old overcoat, and almost before it was light he was already in the yard, as though nothing had happened, even—innocent guile!—the same expression of melancholy on his face.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但让格拉西姆万万没想到的是，木木的叫声把它自己出卖了。事实上，家里的每个仆人很快就晓得哑巴的狗又回来了，就锁在阁楼里，但出于对他及狗的同情，可能是部分处于对他的害怕，人们都没有揭穿他。管家挠着头，失望地摆着手说：“好吧，好吧，愿上帝保佑他！只要不被太太知道就好！”</td>
		<td class="en">It did not even occur to the poor deaf man that Mumu would betray herself by her whining; in reality, every one in the house was soon aware that the dumb man’s dog had come back, and was locked up in his garret, but from sympathy with him and with her, and partly, perhaps, from dread of him, they did not let him know that they had found out his secret.The steward scratched his head, and gave a despairing wave of his hand, as much as to say, ‘Well, well, God have mercy on him!If only it doesn’t come to the mistress’ ears!’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而格拉西姆从没像那天那样卖力过。他不但把院子清理得干干净净、平平整整，用手拔掉了每一根杂草，还把花园篱笆上的木桩一一拔起，看看它们是否牢固，然后又把它们重新钉了回去。其实，就连太太都注意到了他满怀热情的辛勤劳作。那一天当中，格拉西姆悄悄地探望了木木两回。夜晚降临时，他们就躺在阁楼里睡下，而不是在草棚睡。到了凌晨两点时，他才带它出来遛弯，呼吸新鲜空气。格拉西姆在院子里和木木溜达了好长时间，当他正要返回时，忽然，一阵沙沙声从后街的篱笆处传来。木木马上竖起了耳朵，咆哮着奔向篱笆，嗅着四周，发出尖利的叫声。原来，是某个醉汉想躺在篱笆旁睡一晚。恰在此时，在“神经亢奋”了良久后，太太才刚刚入睡。这种亢奋往往是由于她晚饭吃得太多而造成的。这突如其来的狗叫声惊醒了她，吓得她心脏砰砰乱跳，整个人感到眩晕。“来人呀，来人！”她呻吟着喊道，“来人！”惊慌失措的女仆们跑进了她的卧室。“噢，天哪，我快死了！”她边说边痛苦地挥动着胳膊。“又是，又是那条狗！……哎哟，叫大夫来。他们不想让我活了。那狗，又是那条狗！哎哟！”她把头往后一仰，这表明她昏过去了。仆人们赶忙去请大夫，也就是那个家庭大夫，哈瑞通。他总是脚踩一双软底靴，知道怎样小心翼翼地把脉——除了这些，这个大夫别的都不会。一天二十四小时，他往往就睡十四个小时，剩下的时间就在长吁短叹，或者不停地让太太喝月桂汁。大夫立刻跑了过来，用烧着的羽毛熏着房间，太太一睁开眼睛，他就递上一杯珍贵的药水，放在银制的托盘上给她喝。喝过药水后，太太开始呜咽着抱怨那条狗，抱怨加夫里拉，抱怨自己的命，说自己这个老婆子命苦，人人都背弃她，没人可怜她，人人都盼她死。与此同时，不幸的木木还在不停地叫着，格拉西姆试图想把它从篱笆那里叫走，可无济于事。“听……听……又在叫。”太太呻吟道，她又一次眼珠翻白，快晕过去了。大夫轻声吩咐了女仆几句，她便马上跑到外厅摇醒了斯蒂潘，斯蒂潘又跑去叫醒了加夫里拉。而加夫里拉十分生气，又把所有仆人都叫了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">But the dumb man had never shown such energy as on that day; he cleaned and scraped the whole courtyard, pulled up every single weed with his own hand, tugged up every stake in the fence of the flower-garden, to satisfy himself that they were strong enough, and unaided drove them in again; in fact, he toiled and laboured so that even the old lady noticed his zeal.Twice in the course of the day Gerasim went stealthily in to see his prisoner when night came on, he lay down to sleep with her in the garret, not in the hay-loft, and only at two o‘clock in the night he went out to take her a turn in the fresh air.After walking about the courtyard a good while with her, he was just turning back, when suddenly a rustle was heard behind the fence on the side of the back street.Mumu pricked up her ears, growled—went up to the fence, sniffed, and gave vent to a loud shrill bark.Some drunkard had thought fit to take refuge under the fence for the night.At that very time the old lady had just fallen asleep after a prolonged fit of ‘nervous agitation’; these fits of agitation always overtook her after too hearty a supper.The sudden bark waked her up: her heart palpitated, and she felt faint.‘Girls, girls!’ she moaned. ‘Girls!’ The terrified maids ran into her bedroom.‘Oh, oh, I am dying!’she said, flinging her arms about in her agitation.‘Again, that dog again!...Oh, send for the doctor.They mean to be the death of me....The dog, the dog again!Oh!’ And she let her head fall back, which always signified a swoon.They rushed for the doctor, that is, for the household physician, Hariton.This doctor, whose whole qualification consisted in wearing soft-soled boots, knew how to feel the pulse delicately.He used to sleep fourteen hours out of the twenty-four, but the rest of the time he was always sighing, and continually dosing the old lady with cherrybay drops.This doctor ran up at once, fumigated the room with burnt feathers, and when the old lady opened her eyes, promptly offered her a wineglass of the hallowed drops on a silver tray.The old lady took them, but began again at once in a tearful voice complaining of the dog, of Gavrila, and of her fate, declaring that she was a poor old woman, and that every one had forsaken her, no one pitied her, every one wished her dead.Meanwhile the luckless Mumu had gone on barking, while Gerasim tried in vain to call her away from the fence.‘There... there... again,’ groaned the old lady, and once more she turned up the whites of her eyes.The doctor whispered to a maid, she rushed into the outer-hall, and shook Stepan, he ran to wake Gavrila, Gavrila in a fury ordered the whole household to get up.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Gerasim turned round, saw lights and shadows moving in the windows, and with an instinct of coming trouble in his heart, put Mumu under his arm, ran into his garret, and locked himself in.A few minutes later five men were banging at his door, but feeling the resistance of the bolt, they stopped.Gavrila ran up in a fearful state of mind, and ordered them all to wait there and watch till morning.Then he flew off himself to the maids’ quarter, and through an old companion, Liubov Liubimovna, with whose assistance he used to steal tea, sugar, and other groceries and to falsify the accounts, sent word to the mistress that the dog had unhappily run back from somewhere, but that tomorrow she should be killed, and would the mistress be so gracious as not to be angry and to overlook it.The old lady would probably not have been so soon appeased, but the doctor had in his haste given her fully forty drops instead of twelve.The strong dose of narcotic acted; in a quarter of an hour the old lady was in a sound and peaceful sleep; while Gerasim was lying with a white face on his bed, holding Mumu’s mouth tightly shut.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >格拉西姆牵着木木，从容地走着。他走到街角时就停住了，站在那里，像是想到了什么。突然，他加快步伐，奔向克里米亚半岛浅滩。途中，他进了一户人家，院子里正盖着房，他便拿了两块砖夹在腋下离开了。到浅滩后，他沿着岸边来到一个地方，那儿有两艘小划艇系在树桩上（他以前就注意到它们了），他带着木木跳上了其中的一艘划艇。一位跛脚的老人，从菜园角落的小棚里走了出来，跟在后边冲他喊。但格拉西姆只是冲他点了点头，就卖力地向前划，虽是逆流而上，但不一会儿他就划出了两百码远。老人站了一会儿，先是用左手挠了挠背，又换用右手挠，然后便一瘸一拐地回了小棚屋。</td>
		<td class="en">Gerasim walked without haste, still holding Mumu by a string.When he got to the corner of the street, he stood still as though reflecting, and suddenly set off with rapid steps to the Crimean Ford.On the way he went into the yard of a house, where a lodge was being built, and carried away two bricks under his arm.At the Crimean Ford, he turned along the bank, went to a place where there were two little rowing-boats fastened to stakes (he had noticed them there before), and jumped into one of them with Mumu.A lame old man came out of a shed in the corner of a kitchen-garden and shouted after him; but Gerasim only nodded, and began rowing so vigorously, though against stream, that in an instant he had darted two hundred yards away.The old man stood for a while, scratched his back first with the left and then with the right hand, and went back hobbling to the shed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >格拉西姆继续划着。不久，莫斯科城就被抛在了身后。沿着河两岸，绵延不断的草地、菜园、田地、庄稼、小树林以及农家小屋都一一映入眼帘。原野的芬芳扑面而来。他扔了双桨，低下头凑到木木跟前，它正对着他，坐在一块干燥的横木上——船底已积满了水——一动不动地坐着。他用他的大手一把抓住它的后背，而船因水流的冲击，逐渐转向了城市。最终，格拉西姆匆忙直起身子，表情痛苦、愤怒，他将两端系有砖头的绳子绑成了一个索套，套在了木木的脖子上。他将它从河面上举起来，看了它最后一眼。木木信任地看着他，轻轻地摇着尾巴，没有一丝恐惧。他转过头去，眉头紧锁，痛苦地绞纽着双手……格拉西姆什么都听不见，他听不到木木落水时那刺耳的哀鸣，也听不到那砰然作响的落水声。对他来说，这最嘈杂的白天是无声的，是沉寂的，然而最静谧的黑夜对我们而言也并不是毫无声响的。当他再次睁开双眼，河面上依旧不断泛起着小浪花。这些小浪花相互追逐着，依旧拍打着船舷，只是在船后的远处才变成一圈圈四散的涟漪，一直扩散到岸边。</td>
		<td class="en">Gerasim rowed on and on.Moscow was soon left behind.Meadows stretched each side of the bank, market gardens, fields, and copses; peasants’ huts began to make their appearance.There was the fragrance of the country.He threw down his oars, bent his head down to Mumu, who was sitting facing him on a dry cross seat—the bottom of the boat was full of water—and stayed motionless, his mighty hands clasped upon her back, while the boat was gradually carried back by the current towards the town.At last Gerasim drew himself up hurriedly, with a sort of sick anger in his face, he tied up the bricks he had taken with string, made a running noose, put it round Mumu’s neck, lifted her up over the river, and for the last time looked at her.... She watched him confidingly and without any fear, faintly wagging her tail.He turned away, frowned, and wrung his hands....Gerasim heard nothing, neither the quick shrill whine of Mumu as she fell, nor the heavy splash of the water; for him the noisiest day was soundless and silent as even the stillest night is not silent to us.When he opened his eyes again, little wavelets were hurrying over the river, chasing one another; as before they broke against the boat’s side, and only far away behind wide circles moved widening to the bank.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Meanwhile, at that very time, a gigantic figure with a bag on his shoulders and a stick in his hand, was eagerly and persistently stepping out along the T-highroad.It was Gerasim.He was hurrying on without looking round; hurrying homewards, to his own village, to his own country.After drowning poor Mumu, he had run back to his garret, hurriedly packed a few things together in an old horsecloth, tied it up in a bundle, tossed it on his shoulder, and so was ready.He had noticed the road carefully when he was brought to Moscow; the village his mistress had taken him from lay only about twenty miles off the highroad.He walked along it with a sort of invincible purpose, a desperate and at the same time joyous determination.He walked, his shoulders thrown back and his chest expanded; his eyes were fixed greedily straight before him.He hastened as though his old mother were waiting for him at home, as though she were calling him to her after long wanderings in strange parts, among strangers.The summer night, that was just drawing in, was still and warm; on one side, where the sun had set, the horizon was still light and faintly flushed with the last glow of the vanished day; on the other side a blue-grey twilight had already risen up.The night was coming up from that quarter.Quails were in hundreds around; corncrakes were calling to one another in the thickets...Gerasim could not hear them; he could not hear the delicate night-whispering of the trees, by which his strong legs carried him, but he smelt the familiar scent of the ripening rye, which was wafted from the dark fields; he felt the wind, flying to meet him—the wind from home—beat caressingly upon his face, and play with his hair and his beard.He saw before him the whitening road homewards, straight as an arrow.He saw in the sky stars innumerable, lighting up his way, and stepped out, strong and bold as a lion, so that when the rising sun shed its moist rosy light upon the still fresh and unwearied traveller, already thirty miles lay between him and Moscow.</td></tr>
