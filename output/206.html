		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >老巴斯克－华－沃恩跪起身，因虚弱和急切而浑身颤抖，凝望着海面。</td>
		<td class="en">Old Bask-Wah-Wan rose to her knees, trembling with weakness and eagerness, and gazed out over the sea.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“纳姆－博克划起桨来总是笨手笨脚的。”她回忆地唠叨，一边遮着眼睛免受阳光照射，一边凝视着洒满银灰色的水面，“纳姆－博克总是笨手笨脚的。我记得……”</td>
		<td class="en">“Nam-Bok was ever clumsy at the paddle,” she maundered reminiscently, shading the sun from her eyes and staring across the silver-spilled water.“Nam-Bok was ever clumsy.I remember....”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但女人和孩子大声地笑了，他们的笑声中带有轻微的嘲笑，她的声音越来越小，后来她的嘴唇只是无声地蠕动着。</td>
		<td class="en">But the women and children laughed loudly, and there was a gentle mockery in their laughter, and her voice dwindled till her lips moved without sound.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >库加从骨雕中抬起发丝斑白的头，沿着她的视线望去。除了偏离航线时以外，这海豹皮舟正朝着沙滩驶来。船上的人划桨与其说凭的是灵巧，倒不如说靠的就是力气，他沿着阻力最大的曲线划船靠近。库加又低下头去忙活起来，在膝盖间的象牙上他刻了一条鱼的背鳍，像这样的鱼从来没在海里游过。</td>
		<td class="en">Koogah lifted his grizzled head from his bone-carving and followed the path of her eyes.Except when wide yaws took it off its course, a bidarka was heading in for the beach.Its occupant was paddling with more strength than dexterity, and made his approach along the zigzag line of most resistance.Koogah’s head dropped to his work again, and on the ivory tusk between his knees he scratched the dorsal fin of a fish the like of which never swam in the sea.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这无疑是个来自邻村的人，”他最后说道，“来请教我在骨头上打标记的事情。而且这个人笨手笨脚的。他永远都不会知道怎么做。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It is doubtless the man from the next village,” he said finally, “come to consult with me about the marking of things on bone.And the man is a clumsy man.He will never know how.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那是纳姆－博克。”老巴斯克－华－沃恩重复着。“我难道不认识自己的儿子吗？”她尖声反问道，“我说，我再说一遍，那是纳姆－博克。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It is Nam-Bok,” old Bask-Wah-Wan repeated.“Should I not know my son?” she demanded shrilly.“I say, and I say again, it is Nam-Bok.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你都这样说了好几个夏天了。”其中一个女人轻声责备道，“每当海面上的冰雪融化，你就坐着凝望一整天，偶然发现一条独木舟，就会说，‘这是纳姆－博克。’纳姆－博克死了，老巴斯克－华－沃恩，死去的人不会回来了。死去的人是不可能回来的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“And so thou hast said these many summers,” one of the women chided softly.“Ever when the ice passed out of the sea hast thou sat and watched through the long day, saying at each chance canoe, ‘This is Nam-Bok.’ Nam-Bok is dead, O Bask-Wah-Wan, and the dead do not come back.It cannot be that the dead come back.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“纳姆－博克！”那个老女妇人哭喊道，声音如此响亮，如此清晰，整个村子的人都震惊了，看着她。</td>
		<td class="en">“Nam-Bok!” the old woman cried, so loud and clear that the whole village was startled and looked at her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她挣扎着站起来，在沙滩上蹒跚前进。她被一个躺着晒太阳的婴儿绊倒了，婴儿哭了起来，婴儿的母亲哄着婴儿让他停止哭泣，并愤慨地咒骂那个老妇人，可她根本没在意。孩子们在她前面沿着海滩跑着，海豹皮舟上的那个人逐渐靠近，一下子没划好桨，方向偏差，几乎翻了船，这会儿，女人们也跟了上来。库加放下他的海象牙，也走了过去，沉重地倚靠在他的拐杖上，跟在他后面的人，三三两两慢悠悠地走着。</td>
		<td class="en">She struggled to her feet and tottered down the sand.She stumbled over a baby lying in the sun, and the mother hushed its crying and hurled harsh words after the old woman, who took no notice.The children ran down the beach in advance of her, and as the man in the bidarka drew closer, nearly capsizing with one of his ill-directed strokes, the women followed.Koogah dropped his walrus tusk and went also, leaning heavily upon his staff, and after him loitered the men in twos and threes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个海豹皮舟翻向舷侧，海浪的微波几乎要将它沉没，只有一个光着身子的小男孩跑进水里，将船首高高地拉到沙滩上。那个人站起身，用探求的眼光看着那排村民。一件五彩缤纷的运动衫，脏兮兮的，已被穿得破烂不堪，松松垮垮地贴在他宽阔的肩膀上，一条红色棉手帕在他的喉咙处打着水手式的那种平结。他头发短削，戴着一顶渔民的苏格兰式便帽，穿着粗蓝布裤子和笨重的劳动靴，这构成了他的全套装束。</td>
		<td class="en">The bidarka turned broadside and the ripple of surf threatened to swamp it, only a naked boy ran into the water and pulled the bow high up on the sand.The man stood up and sent a questing glance along the line of villagers.A rainbow sweater, dirty and the worse for wear, clung loosely to his broad shoulders, and a red cotton handkerchief was knotted in sailor fashion about his throat.A fisherman’s tam-o’-shanter on his close-clipped head, and dungaree trousers and heavy brogans, completed his outfit.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而对大育空河三角洲地区的这些单纯的渔民来说，他依然是个罕见的人物，他们终生在白令海上向外凝望，在那时仅仅看见过两个白人——一个人口普查员和一个迷路的耶稣会牧师。他们是一个可怜的民族，土里没有金子，手里也没有贵重的毛皮，所以白人们远远超越了他们。并且，经过数千年，阿拉斯加的碎石渐渐使育空河那部分海域变浅，直到船舶在看不见陆地的地方搁浅。所以湿漉漉的海岸，以及它那长长的内部河段和巨大的泥地群岛，被很多行船的人避开了，渔民们不知道这类事情的存在。</td>
		<td class="en">But he was none the less a striking personage to these simple fisherfolk of the great Yukon Delta, who, all their lives, had stared out on Bering Sea and in that time seen but two white men,—the census enumerator and a lost Jesuit priest.They were a poor people, with neither gold in the ground nor valuable furs in hand, so the whites had passed them afar.Also, the Yukon, through the thousands of years, had shoaled that portion of the sea with the detritus of Alaska till vessels grounded out of sight of land.So the sodden coast, with its long inside reaches and huge mud-land archipelagoes, was avoided by the ships of men, and the fisherfolk knew not that such things were.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >库加，那个雕刻骨头的人，仓皇之间向后退，被他的拐杖绊倒在地上。“纳姆－博克！”他一边叫喊着，一边疯狂地争着走开，“纳姆－博克，被吹飞到海上的人，回来了！”</td>
		<td class="en">Koogah, the Bone-Scratcher, retreated backward in sudden haste, tripping over his staff and falling to the ground.“Nam-Bok!” he cried, as he scrambled wildly for footing.“Nam-Bok, who was blown off to sea, come back!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >男男女女都往后退缩，而孩子们在他们腿间急促地奔来跑去。只有欧匹－关是勇敢的，这与他作为村子里的首领很配。他大步走向前，长久认真地注视着这个新来的人。</td>
		<td class="en">The men and women shrank away, and the children scuttled off between their legs.Only Opee-Kwan was brave, as befitted the head man of the village.He strode forward and gazed long and earnestly at the new-comer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是纳姆－博克。”他最后说，听他的话里透出确信无疑，女人们恐惧地恸哭起来，往后挪得更远了。</td>
		<td class="en">“It is Nam-Bok,” he said at last, and at the conviction in his voice the women wailed apprehensively and drew farther away.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个陌生人的嘴唇犹豫地动着，他棕色的脖子扭动着，挣扎着想说出话来。</td>
		<td class="en">The lips of the stranger moved indecisively, and his brown throat writhed and wrestled with unspoken words.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啦啦，这是纳姆－博克。”巴斯克－华－沃恩用嘶哑的声音说着，凝视着他的脸，“我曾经说过纳姆－博克会回来的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“La la, it is Nam-Bok,” Bask-Wah-Wan croaked, peering up into his face.“Ever did I say Nam-Bok would come back.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哎，是纳姆－博克回来了。”这次纳姆－博克自己说话了，他的一条腿跨过海豹皮舟的一侧，一只脚踏在船上，另一只脚踏在岸上。他再次扭动脖子，像是要努力回想起已经忘却的话语。当话说出口时，伴随着喉音出现的是奇怪的声音和双唇的唾液飞溅。“大家好，老伙计们，”他说，“我被海风吹走前，我往日的兄弟们。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ay, it is Nam-Bok come back.”This time it was Nam-Bok himself who spoke, putting a leg over the side of the bidarka and standing with one foot afloat and one ashore.Again his throat writhed and wrestled as he grappled after forgotten words.And when the words came forth they were strange of sound and a spluttering of the lips accompanied the gutturals.“Greeting, O brothers,” he said, “brothers of old time before I went away with the off-shore wind.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他走出来，双脚踩在沙滩上，欧匹－关向他挥手示意让他回去。</td>
		<td class="en">He stepped out with both feet on the sand, and Opee-Kwan waved him back.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你死了，纳姆－博克。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Thou art dead, Nam-Bok,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >纳姆－博克笑了：“我胖了。”</td>
		<td class="en">Nam-Bok laughed. “I am fat.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“死人是不会胖的。”欧匹－关坦白说，“你过得很好，但这事儿很奇怪。没有人能敌得过海上风，而且紧接着几年以后还回来了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Dead men are not fat,” Opee-Kwan confessed.“Thou hast fared well, but it is strange.No man may mate with the off-shore wind and come back on the heels of the years.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我回来了。”纳姆－博克简单地回答。</td>
		<td class="en">“I have come back,” Nam-Bok answered simply.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但愿你是一个幽灵，那么，你就是过去的纳姆－博克的一个转瞬即逝的幽灵。幽灵是可以回来的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Mayhap thou art a shadow, then, a passing shadow of the Nam-Bok that was.Shadows come back.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我饿了。幽灵是不吃东西的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I am hungry.Shadows do not eat.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但欧匹－关心下怀疑，他手抹过额头，感到非常困惑。纳姆－博克也感到困惑不解，他上下打量着那一排渔民，发现他们眼中没有丝毫欢迎的意思。男男女女们都在窃窃私语。孩子们怯生生地偷偷溜回大人们中间，毛发竖立的狗儿向他摇着尾巴，在他身边怀疑地嗅来嗅去。</td>
		<td class="en">But Opee-Kwan doubted, and brushed his hand across his brow in sore puzzlement.Nam-Bok was likewise puzzled, and as he looked up and down the line found no welcome in the eyes of the fisherfolk.The men and women whispered together.The children stole timidly back among their elders, and bristling dogs fawned up to him and sniffed suspiciously.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我生了你，纳姆－博克，你还小的时候，我给你喂奶，”巴斯克－华－沃恩呜咽着说，靠得更近了；“无论你是幽灵，或者不是，我现在都会给你吃的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I bore thee, Nam-Bok, and I gave thee suck when thou wast little,” Bask-Wah-Wan whimpered, drawing closer; “and shadow though thou be, or no shadow, I will give thee to eat now.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >纳姆－博克走近她，但一声恐惧和威胁的咆哮声警告他后退。他用一种奇怪的语言说了听起来像什么“该死的”的话，并补充道：“我不是幽灵，而是一个人。”</td>
		<td class="en">Nam-Bok made to come to her, but a growl of fear and menace warned him back.He said something in a strange tongue which sounded like “Goddam,” and added, “No shadow am I, but a man.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“谁可能了解有关神秘的万物呢？”欧匹－关问道，是问自己，也是问他的部落成员。“我们是，但瞬间后我们又都不是幽灵。如果人类可以变为幽灵，那幽灵不可以变成人吗？纳姆－博克过去是，但现在不是。这个我们知道，但不知道这个是纳姆－博克还是纳姆－博克的幽灵。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Who may know concerning the things of mystery?”Opee-Kwan demanded, half of himself and half of his tribespeople.“We are, and in a breath we are not.If the man may become shadow, may not the shadow become man?Nam-Bok was, but is not.This we know, but we do not know if this be Nam-Bok or the shadow of Nam-Bok.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >纳姆－博克清清了嗓子，做出了回答。“很久以前，欧匹－关，你父亲的父亲离开了，也在几年后回来了。人们在火炉旁给他留了个地方。据说……”他意味深长地停顿了一下，他们在认真地听他所说的话。“据说，”他重复着，深慎地将他的意思讲清楚，“他的女人，希普希普，在他回来后给他生了两个儿子。”</td>
		<td class="en">Nam-Bok cleared his throat and made answer.“In the old time long ago, thy father’s father, Opee-Kwan, went away and came back on the heels of the years.Nor was a place by the fire denied him.It is said...”He paused significantly, and they hung on his utterance.“It is said,” he repeated, driving his point home with deliberation, “that Sipsip, his klooch, bore him two sons after he came back.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但他跟海上风无关。”欧匹－关反驳道，“他去了陆地中心，理所当然地，一个男人要继续前行到达陆地。”</td>
		<td class="en">“But he had no doings with the off-shore wind,” Opee-Kwan retorted.“He went away into the heart of the land, and it is in the nature of things that a man may go on and on into the land.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“海洋也一样。但那不重要。据说……你父亲的父亲讲述了他所见到的奇怪故事。”</td>
		<td class="en">“And likewise the sea.But that is neither here nor there.It is said...that thy father’s father told strange tales of the things he saw.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哎，他讲述的奇怪故事。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ay, strange tales he told.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我也有奇怪的故事要讲，”纳姆－博克狡诈地说，而且当他们犹豫不决的时候，“也有礼物。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I, too, have strange tales to tell,” Nam-Bok stated insidiously.And, as they wavered, “And presents likewise.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他从海豹皮舟上拉出一条披肩，质地和颜色棒极了，将它搭在妈妈的肩膀上。女人们集体发出羡慕的赞叹声，老巴斯克－华－沃恩拨弄着色彩鲜艳的织物，轻拍着它，孩子般快乐地低声哼唱着。</td>
		<td class="en">He pulled from the bidarka a shawl, marvellous of texture and color, and flung it about his mother’s shoulders.The women voiced a collective sigh of admiration, and old Bask-Wah-Wan ruffled the gay material and patted it and crooned in childish joy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他有故事要讲。”库加喃喃低语。“而且有礼物。”一个女人附和道。</td>
		<td class="en">“He has tales to tell,” Koogah muttered.“And presents,” a woman seconded.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >欧匹－关知道他的人民很急切，而且，他意识到对于那些没听过的故事，他自已也有一种渴望的好奇心。“捕鱼一直不错，”他明智地说道，“我们有充足的油。所以来吧，纳姆－博克，让我们尽情地吃。”</td>
		<td class="en">And Opee-Kwan knew that his people were eager, and further, he was aware himself of an itching curiosity concerning those untold tales.“The fishing has been good,” he said judiciously, “and we have oil in plenty.So come, Nam-Bok, let us feast.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >其中两个人肩扛海豹皮舟，将它抬到火旁。纳姆－博克走在欧匹－关的旁边，村民紧随其后，只有那些女人拖延了一会儿，用手指抚摸着披肩。</td>
		<td class="en">Two of the men hoisted the bidarka on their shoulders and carried it up to the fire.Nam-Bok walked by the side of Opee-Kwan, and the villagers followed after, save those of the women who lingered a moment to lay caressing fingers on the shawl.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >筵席进行期间很少有人谈话，尽管很多人好奇地偷瞄巴斯克－华－沃恩的儿子。这使他感到尴尬——然而，不是因为他生性羞怯，而是因为海豹油的恶臭让他没了胃口，而且他强烈渴望隐藏他对这一话题的感受。</td>
		<td class="en">There was little talk while the feast went on, though many and curious were the glances stolen at the son of Bask-Wah-Wan.This embarrassed him—not because he was modest of spirit, however, but for the fact that the stench of the seal-oil had robbed him of his appetite, and that he keenly desired to conceal his feelings on the subject.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“吃吧，你饿了。”欧匹－关命令道，纳姆－博克闭上双眼，将手放入一大锅腐臭的鱼里。</td>
		<td class="en">“Eat; thou art hungry,” Opee-Kwan commanded, and Nam-Bok shut both his eyes and shoved his fist into the big pot of putrid fish.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啦啦，不要不好意思。今年海豹很多，强壮的人永远都是饥饿的。”巴斯克－华－沃恩将一大块极其令人作呕的鲑鱼浸到油里，将滴着油的鲑鱼温柔地递给儿子。</td>
		<td class="en">“La la, be not ashamed.The seal were many this year, and strong men are ever hungry.”And Bask-Wah-Wan sopped a particularly offensive chunk of salmon into the oil and passed it fondly and dripping to her son.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >绝望中，前驱症状提醒着他，他的胃口没有老人们的那么好，他填满烟斗开始吸烟。人们吵闹着边吃边看。尽管可以从到北部进行贸易的爱斯基摩人那不时得到少量劣质的烟草，但他们当中很少有人能吹嘘自己非常熟悉珍贵的烟草。坐在他旁边的库加，表示他不反对抽烟，抽了几口后，嘴上厚厚的一层油，在琥珀色的烟斗柄上被吸掉了。随即纳姆－博克用只颤抖的手捂着肚子，拒绝了再次给他的食物。他说库加可以保留烟斗，因为从一开始他就打算把这个孝敬给他。人们舔舔手指，对他的慷慨表示赞同。</td>
		<td class="en">In despair, when premonitory symptoms warned him that his stomach was not so strong as of old, he filled his pipe and struck up a smoke.The people fed on noisily and watched.Few of them could boast of intimate acquaintance with the precious weed, though now and again small quantities and abominable qualities were obtained in trade from the Eskimos to the northward.Koogah, sitting next to him, indicated that he was not averse to taking a draw, and between two mouthfuls, with the oil thick on his lips, sucked away at the amber stem.And thereupon Nam-Bok held his stomach with a shaky hand and declined the proffered return.Koogah could keep the pipe, he said, for he had intended so to honor him from the first.And the people licked their fingers and approved of his liberality.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >欧匹－关站起身，“老纳姆－博克，现在，筵席结束了，我们要听有关你见过的那些奇怪的事情。”</td>
		<td class="en">Opee-Kwan rose to his feet “And now, O Nam-Bok, the feast is ended, and we would listen concerning the strange things you have seen.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >渔民们双手鼓掌，把活计拿到自己身边，准备倾听。男人们忙于制造长矛和雕刻象牙，而女人们刮掉粗毛海皮上的脂肪，并将它们捋顺或者用兽筋缝制软靴。</td>
		<td class="en">The fisherfolk applauded with their hands, and gathering about them their work, prepared to listen.The men were busy fashioning spears and carving on ivory, while the women scraped the fat from the hides of the hair seal and made them pliable or sewed muclucs with threads of sinew.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >纳姆－博克扫视着这一切，但它却并不像他回忆中的那么有吸引力。流浪的那些年，他向往的就是这个场景，而现在这个场景出现了，他却感到失望。他认为，这种空无内容清贫的生活，跟他已经习惯的那种生活没法比。尽管如此，他会使他们的视野开阔一点儿，一想到这里他的眼睛就闪闪发光。</td>
		<td class="en">Nam-Bok’s eyes roved over the scene, but there was not the charm about it that his recollection had warranted him to expect.During the years of his wandering he had looked forward to just this scene, and now that it had come he was disappointed.It was a bare and meagre life, he deemed, and not to be compared to the one to which he had become used.Still, he would open their eyes a bit, and his own eyes sparkled at the thought.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“兄弟们，”他开始了，自以为是地叙述他做过的大事，“那是多年前的夏末，我离开的时候，可能差不多是这样的天气。你们都记得那一天，海鸥低飞，来自陆地的风猛烈地吹着，逆着风我都无法控制我的海豹皮舟。我将海豹皮舟的盖子绑在身上，那样水就进不来了，整晚我都在跟暴风雨作斗争。早上看不到陆地——只有海洋——海上风紧紧地拥我入怀，一直向前。这样过了３个晚上，拂晓时分我还是没看到陆地，海上风不肯放过我。</td>
		<td class="en">“Brothers,” he began, with the smug complacency of a man about to relate the big things he has done, “it was late summer of many summers back, with much such weather as this promises to be, when I went away.You all remember the day, when the gulls flew low, and the wind blew strong from the land, and I could not hold my bidarka against it.I tied the covering of the bidarka about me so that no water could get in, and all of the night I fought with the storm.And in the morning there was no land,—only the sea,—and the off-shore wind held me close in its arms and bore me along.Three such nights whitened into dawn and showed me no land, and the off-shore wind would not let me go.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当第四天来临，我跟疯子似的了。因缺乏食物我无力浸桨拨水，晕头转向，口很渴。但是海不再狂躁了，温和的南风吹来，环视四周的时候，我看到的景象让我以为自己真的疯了。”</td>
		<td class="en">And when the fourth day came, I was as a madman.I could not dip my paddle for want of food; and my head went round and round, what of the thirst that was upon me.But the sea was no longer angry, and the soft south wind was blowing, and as I looked about me I saw a sight that made me think I was indeed mad.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >纳姆－博克停下来，剔去留在牙缝上的一片鲑鱼，男人和女人们的手闲了下来，头伸向前，等待着。</td>
		<td class="en">Nam-Bok paused to pick away a sliver of salmon lodged between his teeth, and the men and women, with idle hands and heads craned forward, waited.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那是一个独木舟，一个大的独木舟。即使把我见过的所有独木舟用来制成一个，都没有那么大。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It was a canoe, a big canoe.If all the canoes I have ever seen were made into one canoe, it would not be so large.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人们发出怀疑的惊叹声，而经历过很多沧桑的库加摇摇头。</td>
		<td class="en">There were exclamations of doubt, and Koogah, whose years were many, shook his head.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“如果每个海豹皮舟是一粒沙子那么大，”纳姆－博克不服地继续说道，“即使海豹皮舟有这个沙滩上的沙子这么多，他们仍然不能制造出一个像我第四天早上看到的那么大的独木舟。那是一个很大的独木舟，它被称作纵帆船。我看见这个奇迹般的东西，这个大纵帆船，跟着我，我看到上面有人——”</td>
		<td class="en">“If each bidarka were as a grain of sand,” Nam-Bok defiantly continued, “and if there were as many bidarkas as there be grains of sand in this beach, still would they not make so big a canoe as this I saw on the morning of the fourth day.It was a very big canoe, and it was called a schooner.I saw this thing of wonder, this great schooner, coming after me, and on it I saw men—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“等等，哦　纳姆－博克！”欧匹－关插话道，“他们是什么样的人？——高个子？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Hold, O Nam-Bok!”Opee-Kwan broke in.“What manner of men were they?—big men?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，仅仅是像你和我这样的人。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Nay, mere men like you and me.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“The sides were tall, the men short.”Opee-Kwan stated the premises with conviction.“And did these men dip with long paddles?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >纳姆－博克露齿而笑。“没有桨。”他说。</td>

		<td class="en">An hour passed, and a second, and Nam-Bok slept, and the talk went on.The evening sun dipped toward the northwest, and at eleven at night was nearly due north.Then it was that the head man and the bone-scratcher separated themselves from the council and aroused Nam-Bok.He blinked up into their faces and turned on his side to sleep again.Opee-Kwan gripped him by the arm and kindly but firmly shook his senses back into him.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But Opee-Kwan spoke more softly.“Thou wast bidarka-mate with me when we were boys,” he said.“Together we first chased the seal and drew the salmon from the traps.And thou didst drag me back to life, Nam-Bok, when the sea closed over me and I was sucked down to the black rocks.Together we hungered and bore the chill of the frost, and together we crawled beneath the one fur and lay close to each other.And because of these things, and the kindness in which I stood to thee, it grieves me sore that thou shouldst return such a remarkable liar.We cannot understand, and our heads be dizzy with the things thou hast spoken.It is not good, and there has been much talk in the council.Wherefore we send thee away, that our heads may remain clear and strong and be not troubled by the unaccountable things.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“If thou art Nam-Bok,” Opee-Kwan was saying, “thou art a fearful and most wonderful liar; if thou art the shadow of Nam-Bok, then thou speakest of shadows, concerning which it is not good that living men have knowledge.This great village thou hast spoken of we deem the village of shadows.Therein flutter the souls of the dead; for the dead be many and the living few.The dead do not come back.Never have the dead come back—save thou with thy wonder-tales.It is not meet that the dead come back, and should we permit it, great trouble may be our portion.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >纳姆－博克很了解他的人民，知道会议的决定是至高无上的。所以他任人把自己带到水边，在那里他被扔近他的海豹皮舟里，手里塞进了一只桨。一只迷途的野禽在朝海的某处鸣叫着，海浪软绵绵地冲上沙地留下凹面。暗淡的暮光笼罩着陆地和海面，太阳在北面闷烧着，朦胧混乱，笼罩着血红的迷雾。海鸥低飞。海上风猛烈刺骨地吹着，顺风方向大量的阴云预示着恶劣的天气。</td>
		<td class="en">Nam-Bok knew his people well and was aware that the voice of the council was supreme.So he allowed himself to be led down to the water’s edge, where he was put aboard his bidarka and a paddle thrust into his hand.A stray wild-fowl honked somewhere to seaward, and the surf broke limply and hollowly on the sand.A dim twilight brooded over land and water, and in the north the sun smouldered, vague and troubled, and draped about with blood-red mists.The gulls were flying low.The off-shore wind blew keen and chill, and the black-massed clouds behind it gave promise of bitter weather.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Nam-Bok stood up that his voice might carry.“O Bask-Wah-Wan, mother that bore me!” he called.“Listen to the words of Nam-Bok, thy son.There be room in his bidarka for two, and he would that thou camest with him.For his journey is to where there are fish and oil in plenty.There the frost comes not, and life is easy, and the things of iron do the work of men.Wilt thou come, O Bask-Wah-Wan?”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">She debated a moment, while the bidarka drifted swiftly from her, then raised her voice to a quavering treble.“I am old, Nam-Bok, and soon I shall pass down among the shadows.But I have no wish to go before my time.I am old, Nam-Bok, and I am afraid.”</td></tr>
