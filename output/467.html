		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天，一只狼獾在山坡上游荡，路过一个拐角处时，他突然看到一块大岩石。</td>
		<td class="en">One day a wolverine was out walking on the hill-side, when, on turning a corner, he suddenly saw a large rock.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我听到刚刚有东西在走动，是不是你？”狼獾问。他是一种很谨慎的动物，总是喜欢刨根问底。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Was that you I heard walking about just now?’ he asked, for wolverines are cautious animals, and always like to know the reasons of things.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“当然不是我了。”岩石回答，“我连怎么走都不知道。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘No, certainly not,’ answered the rock; ‘I don’t know how to walk.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是我确实看见你走路了。”狼獾继续说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘But I SAW you walking,’ continued the wolverine.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“恐怕没人教过你要说真话吧。”岩石反驳说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I am afraid that you were not taught to speak the truth,’ retorted the rock.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你不必狡辩了。虽然我很确定你追不上我，但我确实看到了你在走路。”狼獾回答。他跑开一段路，停下来看看岩石有没有在追他，但让他恼怒的是，岩石还呆在原来的地方。</td>
		<td class="en">‘You need not speak like that, for I have SEEN you walking,’ replied the wolverine, ‘though I am quite sure that you could never catch ME!’ and he ran a little distance and then stopped to see if the rock was pursuing him; but, to his vexation, the rock was still in the same place.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是狼獾走上前来，用爪子打了岩石一拳，说：“好了，现在你可以追我了吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">Then the wolverine went up close, and struck the rock a blow with his paw, saying: ‘Well, will you catch me NOW?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不能走路，但我能滚动。”岩石回答。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I can’t walk, but I can ROLL,’ answered the rock.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >狼獾哈哈大笑起来，说：“噢，也可以啊。”说完就开始向山那边跑去。</td>
		<td class="en">And the wolverine laughed and said: ‘Oh, that will do just as well’; and began to run down the side of the mountain.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >开始他跑得很慢，心想：“还是给岩石一次机会吧。”但很快他加快了速度，因为他看到岩石几乎就在自己脚跟后面了。</td>
		<td class="en">At first he went quite slowly, ‘just to give the rock a chance,’ he thought to himself; but soon he quickened his pace, for he found that the rock was almost at his heels.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但狼獾跑得越快，岩石就滚得越快。渐渐地，这小家伙开始感到很累，后悔当初不该招惹岩石。</td>
		<td class="en">But the faster the wolverine ran, the faster the rock rolled, and by-and-by the little creature began to get very tired, and was sorry he had not left the rock to itself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他想，自己如果能够加猛劲，就能冲到山脚下那茂密的树林中去，而岩石根本去不了那里。于是他攒足了力气，这次不跑了，而是一跃一跃地跳过树枝和石头。但无论他怎么努力，岩石还是一直紧紧跟在他后面。</td>
		<td class="en">Thinking that if he could manage to put on a spurt he would reach the forest of great trees at the bottom of the mountain, where the rock could not come, he gathered up all his strength, and instead of running he leaped over sticks and stones, but, whatever he did, the rock was always close behind him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >最后，他筋疲力尽，连自己要去哪里都看不清了。他被树枝绊了一下，摔倒了。</td>
		<td class="en">At length he grew so weary that he could not even see where he was going, and catching his foot in a branch he tripped and fell.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >岩石立刻停住了，狼獾却尖叫了起来：</td>
		<td class="en">The rock stopped at once, but there came a shriek from the wolverine:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“下去，快下去！你没看到你压到我的腿了吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Get off, get off! can’t you see that you are on my legs?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你为什么要招惹我呢？”岩石问，</td>
		<td class="en">‘Why did you not leave me alone?’ asked the rock.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我本来不想动——我讨厌动。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I did not want to move—I hate moving.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是你可以动。除非有人逼我，不然现在我才不会动呢！”</td>
		<td class="en">But you WOULD have it, and I certainly sha’n’t move now till I am forced to.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我要把我的兄弟们叫来。”狼獾回答，</td>
		<td class="en">‘I will call my brothers,’ answered the wolverine.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“森林里有很多我的兄弟，个个都比你强壮，等着瞧吧！”</td>
		<td class="en">‘There are many of them in the forest, and you will soon see that they are stronger than you.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他喊啊，喊啊，直到野狼、狐狸和各种动物们都纷纷跑来瞧发生了什么事。</td>
		<td class="en">And he called, and called, and called, till wolves and foxes and all sorts of other creatures all came running to see what was the matter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们把狼獾围了一圈，问道：“你怎么跑到岩石下面去了？”他们一遍又一遍地问，狼獾却迟迟不肯回答，因为他跟大部分动物一样，不愿意承认是自己惹祸上身的。</td>
		<td class="en">‘How DID you get under that rock?’ asked they, making a ring round him; but they had to repeat their question several times before the wolverine would answer, for he, like many other persons, found it hard to confess that he had brought his troubles on himself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“唉，我真是笨。我想找人陪我玩，”他最后生气地说，“我就跟岩石比试，看它能不能追上我。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Well, I was dull, and wanted someone to play with me,’ he said at last, in sulky voice, ‘and I challenged the rock to catch me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我想我肯定是跑得最快的；但我被绊倒了，它就压在了我身上。</td>
		<td class="en">Of course I thought I could run the fastest; but I tripped, and it rolled on me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这只是场意外。”</td>
		<td class="en">It was just an accident.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“做出这么愚蠢的事，你活该。”动物们说。但他们还是用力推啊，拉啊，折腾了很久，岩石却纹丝不动。</td>
		<td class="en">‘It serves you right for being so silly,’ said they; but they pushed and hauled at the rock for a long time without making it move an inch.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你们真是一点儿用都没有。”狼獾疼痛至极，生气地大吼，“要是你们救不出我，我只能看看我的朋友雷电能做些什么了。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘You are no good at all,’ cried the wolverine crossly, for it was suffering great pain, ‘and if you cannot get me free, I shall see what my friends the lightning and thunder can do.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他大声呼唤，让闪电尽快过来帮助自己。</td>
		<td class="en">And he called loudly to the lightning to come and help him as quickly as possible.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >几分钟后，天边乌云滚滚而来，雷声大作。野狼、狐狸和其他所有的动物都仓皇失措，四处逃散了。</td>
		<td class="en">In a few minutes a dark cloud came rolling up the sky, giving out such terrific claps of thunder that the wolves and the foxes and all the other creatures ran helter-skelter in all directions.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，他们尽管很害怕，还是没有忘记拜托闪电脱去狼獾的外衣，解救出他的腿，同时小心不要弄伤他。</td>
		<td class="en">But, frightened though they were, they did not forget to beg the lightning to take off the wolverine’s coat and to free his legs, but to be careful not to hurt him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是，闪电钻进乌云里酝酿了一阵子，积蓄全新的力量，直冲下来，正好击在岩石上。岩石被击得四处乱飞，狼獾的外衣也被撕成了小片，整齐地脱落下来，但狼獾自己一点儿也没有受伤。</td>
		<td class="en">So the lightning disappeared into the cloud for a moment to gather up fresh strength, and then came rushing down, right upon the rock, which it sent flying in all directions, and took the wolverine’s coat so neatly that, though it was torn into tiny shreds, the wolverine himself was quite unharmed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你怎么这么笨呢，”狼獾赤裸裸地站着说，</td>
		<td class="en">‘That was rather clumsy of you,’ said he, standing up naked in his flesh.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你原本肯定可以只击碎岩石，而不把我的外衣撕烂的！”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Surely you could have split the rock without tearing my coat to bits!’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他弯下腰去捡这些碎片。</td>
		<td class="en"> And he stooped down to pick up the pieces.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >碎片实在太多了，他花了很长时间，终于把它们全部拾到了手里。</td>
		<td class="en">It took him a long time, for there were a great many of them, but at last he had them all in his hand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我要去找我的青蛙姐姐，”狼獾心想，“她会帮我把衣服缝起来的。”接着，他立即出发去了他姐姐住的沼泽。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I’ll go to my sister the frog,’ he thought to himself, ‘and she will sew them together for me’; and he set off at once for the swamp in which his sister lived.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你可以把我的外衣缝起来吗？</td>
		<td class="en">‘Will you sew my coat together?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >很不幸我出了一次意外，这衣服简直不能穿了。”他找到了她，对她说。</td>
		<td class="en">I had an unlucky accident, and it is quite impossible to wear,’ he said, when he found her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我很乐意。”青蛙回答，因为她一直被教导要懂礼貌。她拿出针线开始缝合碎片。</td>
		<td class="en">‘With pleasure,’ she answered, for she had always been taught to be polite; and getting her needle and thread she began to fit the pieces.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管她很温厚，却并不聪明；她缝错了几片。</td>
		<td class="en">But though she was very good-natured, she was not very clever, and she got some of the bits wrong.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >狼獾对自己的衣服很是挑剔，一穿上它，他就十分生气。</td>
		<td class="en">When the wolverine, who was very particular about his clothes, came to put it on, he grew very angry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你真是个没用的东西！”他大叫，</td>
		<td class="en">‘What a useless creature you are!’ cried he.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你打算让我穿着这样一件外衣出去晃荡吗？</td>
		<td class="en">‘Do you expect me to go about in such a coat as that?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >为什么整个背上凸出来一块，好像我驼背一样；胸膛这里也这么紧，我估计，我一呼吸它就会爆裂。</td>
		<td class="en">Why it bulges all down the back, as if I had a hump, and it is so tight across the chest that I expect it to burst every time I breathe.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我知道你很笨，但没想到你能笨到这种程度。”</td>
		<td class="en">I knew you were stupid, but I did not think you were as stupid as that.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >狼獾在可怜的青蛙头上打了一拳，一下子把她打到了水里，然后就生气地走开，去找他的老鼠妹妹了。</td>
		<td class="en">And giving the poor frog a blow on her head, which knocked her straight into the water, he walked off in a rage to his younger sister the mouse.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我早上划破了外衣，”他看到老鼠坐在门前吃苹果，就开始诉说，</td>
		<td class="en">‘I tore my coat this morning,’ he began, when he had found her sitting at the door of her house eating an apple.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“它彻底成了小碎片，我就把它带给我们的青蛙姐姐，请她帮我缝起来。</td>
		<td class="en">‘It was all in little bits, and I took it to our sister the frog to ask her to sew it for me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但你看看她缝成什么样了！</td>
		<td class="en">But just look at the way she has done it!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >你还得把它弄成一片一片的，再把它们正确地缝在一起。我希望这次能不再让我抱怨了。”</td>
		<td class="en">You will have to take it to pieces and fit them together properly, and I hope I shall not have to complain again.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >由于狼獾比老鼠年长很多，他习惯了用这种说话方式。</td>
		<td class="en">For as the wolverine was older than the mouse, he was accustomed to speak to her in this manner.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，老鼠也已经适应了这一套，她只是回答：“我觉得你还是呆在这儿等我把它弄好。如果有什么需要改动的地方，我再改。”</td>
		<td class="en">However, the mouse was used to it and only answered: ‘I think you had better stay here till it is done, and if there is any alteration needed I can make it.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因此，狼獾就坐在一堆干蕨上，拿起苹果，没经过老鼠允许就吃完了。</td>
		<td class="en">So the wolverine sat down on a heap of dry ferns, and picking up the apple, he finished it without even asking the mouse’s leave.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >最后，外衣缝好了。狼獾穿上它。</td>
		<td class="en">At last the coat was ready, and the wolverine put it on.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“很好，很合适，”他说，“你缝得真利索。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Yes, it fits very well,’ said he, ‘and you have sewn it very neatly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我下次经过这条路时，会给你带一大把玉米报答你的。”接着，他丢下感激万分的老鼠，自己机灵地跑开了。</td>
		<td class="en">When I pass this way again I will bring you a handful of corn, as a reward’; and he ran off as smart as ever, leaving the mouse quite grateful behind him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >狼獾四处游荡了好几天，来到了一个食物紧缺的地方。整整一星期，他一无所获。</td>
		<td class="en">He wandered about for many days, till he reached a place where food was very scarce, and for a whole week he went without any.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他开始绝望了，忽然碰到一只正在睡觉的熊。</td>
		<td class="en">He was growing desperate, when he suddenly came upon a bear that was lying asleep.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊！终于有食物了！”他想。但是要怎么杀死这个比自己大很多的熊呢？</td>
		<td class="en">‘Ah! here is food at last!’ thought he; but how was he to kill the bear, who was so much bigger than himself?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尝试用武力是没用的，他必须要想出一个巧妙的计划，让熊受控于自己。</td>
		<td class="en">It was no use to try force, he must invent some cunning plan which would get her into his power.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >终于，一番深思熟虑之后，他想到了些什么，就冲着熊走去，大叫说：“是你吗，妹妹？”</td>
		<td class="en">At last, after thinking hard, he decided upon something, and going up to the bear, he exclaimed: ‘Is that you, my sister?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >熊转过身看到了狼獾，小声嘟哝着：“我从来没听说过我还有个哥哥。”那声音小得没人能听见。接着她就站起来，飞快地跑向一棵树，三两下就爬了上去。</td>
		<td class="en">The bear turned round and saw the wolverine, and murmuring to herself, so low that nobody could hear, ‘I never heard before that I had a brother,’ got up and ran quickly to a tree, up which she climbed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >此时，狼獾眼睁睁地看着自己的晚餐在面前消失不见，他非常生气。更恼火的是，他自己不能像熊一样爬树。于是，他就跟上来，站在树底下，大声尖叫：“妹妹，快下来。爸爸派我来找你。</td>
		<td class="en">Now the wolverine was very angry when he saw his dinner vanishing in front of him, especially as HE could not climb trees like the bear, so he followed, and stood at the foot of the tree, shrieking as loud as he could, ‘Come down, sister; our father has sent me to look for you!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >你那会儿还是个小女孩，出去摘浆果的时候走丢了。不久前，我们才从一个海狸那儿听说了你呆的地方。”</td>
		<td class="en">You were lost when you were a little girl and went out picking berries, and it was only the other day that we heard from a beaver where you were.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >听到这些话，熊稍微向树下挪了一点儿。狼獾见状，继续说：</td>
		<td class="en"> At these words, the bear came a little way down the tree, and the wolverine, seeing this, went on:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你不是很喜欢浆果吗？</td>
		<td class="en">‘Are you not fond of berries?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我也是！</td>
		<td class="en">I am!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >并且我知道有一个地方，浆果长得特别茂盛，连地面都被盖住了。</td>
		<td class="en">And I know a place where they grow so thick the ground is quite hidden.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >还等什么，亲自去找吧！</td>
		<td class="en">Why, look for yourself!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个山坡上长满浆果，都成了红色的了！”</td>
		<td class="en">That hillside is quite red with them!’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我看不远，”熊说着，就整个爬下来了。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I can’t see so far,’ answered the bear, now climbing down altogether.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你一定有一对绝好的眼睛！</td>
		<td class="en">‘You must have wonderfully good eyes!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我多希望自己也有啊，可惜我的视力很差。”</td>
		<td class="en">I wish I had; but my sight is very short.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我的视力开始也很差，后来爸爸捣碎了一桶的小红莓，把它们涂在了我的眼睛上，视力就变好了。”狼獾回答，</td>
		<td class="en">‘So was mine till my father smashed a pailful of cranberries, and rubbed my eyes with them,’ replied the wolverine.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不过，如果你想去采集一些浆果，我也可以像他那样做。你就很快可以像我一样看得远了。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘But if you like to go and gather some of the berries I will do just as he did, and you will soon be able to see as far as me.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >熊花了很长时间采集浆果，因为她做什么都很慢，而且她弯腰时背很疼。</td>
		<td class="en">It took the bear a long while to gather the berries, for she was slow about everything, and, besides, it made her back ache to stoop.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但最终她还是满载而归，把满满的一袋浆果放到狼獾旁边。</td>
		<td class="en">But at last she returned with a sackful, and put them down beside the wolverine.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“真是太好了，妹妹！”狼獾大喊，</td>
		<td class="en">‘That is splendid, sister!’ cried the wolverine.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“现在你平躺在地上，头枕着这块石头，我来把浆果捣碎。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Now lie flat on the ground with your head on this stone, while I smash them.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >熊累极了，听到让自己这么做，很是高兴。于是，她舒舒服服地伸开四肢，躺在草地上。</td>
		<td class="en">The bear, who was very tired, was only too glad to do as she was bid, and stretched herself comfortably on the grass.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >过了一会儿，狼獾说：“我准备好了。刚开始你会觉得浆果弄得眼睛很疼，但千万不要动，不然浆果汁就会流出来，一切都要重新开始。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘I am ready now,’ said the wolverine after a bit; ‘just at first you will find that the berries make your eyes smart, but you must be careful not to move, or the juice will run out, and then it will have to be done all over again.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是，熊答应自己会一动不动地躺着；但是当小红莓刚一碰到她的眼睛时，她大吼一声，跳了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">So the bear promised to lie very still; but the moment the cranberries touched her eyes she sprang up with a roar.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，你不必在乎这么一点儿疼痛的，”狼獾说，“马上就会好了，你很快就会看到你连做梦都想不到的各种事物。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Oh, you mustn’t mind a little pain,’ said the wolverine, ‘it will soon be over, and then you will see all sorts of things you have never dreamt of.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >熊呻吟着躺下去。她的眼睛充满了红莓汁，完全瞎了。狼獾拿起一把锋利的刀子，刺向她的心脏。</td>
		<td class="en"> The bear sank down with a groan, and as her eyes were full of cranberry juice, which completely blinded her, the wolverine took up a sharp knife and stabbed her to the heart.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接着，狼獾扒掉熊皮，眼睛机敏地张望，发现了藏在岩石后的一个帐篷。他从那里偷了点儿火，开始一点一点地烤熊肉。</td>
		<td class="en">Then he took off the skin, and, stealing some fire from a tent, which his sharp eyes had perceived hidden behind a rock, he set about roasting the bear bit by bit.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他觉得这肉是他尝过的最好吃的。晚餐结束之后，他下定决心，如果又饿了，就再试试这样的伎俩。</td>
		<td class="en">He thought the meat was the best he ever had tasted, and when dinner was done he made up his mind to try that same trick again, if ever he was hungry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他极有可能这么做！</td>
		<td class="en">And very likely he did!</td></tr>
