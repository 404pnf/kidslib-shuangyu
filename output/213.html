		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >许多各式各样的地毯铺开在他们面前的地板上——他们最开始寻觅到的是两块布鲁塞尔地毯，并且打算就买那两块了，但是一些染色地毯又吸引了他们的眼球，延长了他们关于采购意向账目本的讨论。部门经理亲自在一旁恭候他们，以表现对他们的尊敬——或者说是对乔的尊敬，她非常清楚这一点，因为她注意到带他们上楼来的电梯操作员一脸惊诧地张着嘴。而且她也注意到，当她和乔一起在他们住的镇子西头的小区散步时，街角的顽童和年轻人明显对乔表现出尊敬。</td>
		<td class="en">Many patterns of carpet lay rolled out before them on the floor—two of Brussels showed the beginning of their quest, and its ending in that direction; while a score of ingrains lured their eyes and prolonged the debate between desire pocket-book.The head of the department did them the honor of waiting upon them himself—or did Joe the honor, as she well knew, for she had noted the open-mouthed awe of the elevator boy who brought them up.Nor had she been blind to the marked respect shown Joe by the urchins and groups of young fellows on corners, when she walked with him in their own neighborhood down at the west end of the town.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但部门经理被叫去接电话了。她脑海对地毯的美好愿望和关于意向清单的烦恼被推到一旁，取而代之的是更大的疑惑和焦虑。</td>
		<td class="en">But the head of the department was called away to the telephone, and in her mind the splendid promise of the carpets and the irk of the pocket-book were thrust aside by a greater doubt and anxiety.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“乔，可我真不明白你喜欢拳击哪点。”她虽说得温柔，语气却是坚决的，话语中透露出最近他们之间存在着一些令人不满意的交谈。</td>
		<td class="en">“But I don’t see what you find to like in it, Joe,” she said softly, the note of insistence in her words betraying recent and unsatisfactory discussion.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有那么一瞬间，阴霾笼罩了他孩子气的脸，但是这种阴霾很快又被柔和的暖意驱散了。他只是个男孩，正如她只是个女孩一样——这两个年轻人就要一同开始生活，一同租房子，一起买地毯。</td>
		<td class="en">For a fleeting moment a shadow darkened his boyish face, to be replaced by the glow of tenderness.He was only a boy, as she was only a girl—two young things on the threshold of life, house-renting and buying carpets together.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“着急有什么用呢？”他问道，“这是最后一场比赛，真的是最后一场。”</td>
		<td class="en">“What’s the good of worrying?” he questioned.“It’s the last go, the very last.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他冲她笑了笑，但她从他的嘴唇看到了他下意识里表现出的一切，却未看到他无声叹气中的舍弃。出于一个女人对爱人本能的控制欲，她害怕拳赛这个她所不能理解却又与他的生活密切相关的东西。</td>
		<td class="en">He smiled at her, but she saw on his lips the unconscious and all but breathed sigh of renunciation, and with the instinctive monopoly of woman for her mate, she feared this thing she did not understand and which gripped his life so strongly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你知道的，和奥尼尔比的那场还清了妈妈房子的最后一笔贷款，”他继续说，“所以我已经不担心那件事了。现在再和庞塔比赛最后一场，我在银行就能存一百美元——整整一百美元，就是这笔奖金——是我和你开始新生活的私房钱。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You know the go with O’Neil cleared the last payment on mother’s house,” he went on.“And that’s off my mind.Now this last with Ponta will give me a hundred dollars in bank—an even hundred, that’s the purse—for you and me to start on, a nest-egg.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她漠视金钱的诱惑。“但是你喜欢，这个——这个你所说的‘游戏’。为什么？”</td>
		<td class="en">She disregarded the money appeal.“But you like it, this—this ‘game’ you call it.Why?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他不善言辞。工作时，他用手来表达自己，在拳击场上，他用身体和肌肉的运动来表达自己；但要他亲口来说出拳击场的魅力，可就超出他的能力范围了。但他还是先停了一会儿，试图表达参加拳击比赛时的感受，分析人生达到巅峰时的感觉。</td>
		<td class="en">He lacked speech-expression.He expressed himself with his hands, at his work, and with his body and the play of his muscles in the squared ring; but to tell with his own lips the charm of the squared ring was beyond him.Yet he essayed, and haltingly at first, to express what he felt and analyzed when playing the Game at the supreme summit of existence.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我只知道，吉纳维芙，当你在拳台上正中对手要害时，当对手准备好两只拳头等着你，而你根本没给他沾到自己的机会时，当你自己的小拳头落到对手身上，而他东倒西歪地勉强支撑，裁判把他拉走，比赛结束时，那时你在拳击场上感觉很好。所有观众都在叫喊着、沸腾着，你知道自己是最棒的，你一点儿诈也不使还能赢得最后的胜利，因为你是最棒的。我跟你说——”</td>
		<td class="en">“All I know, Genevieve, is that you feel good in the ring when you’ve got the man where you want him, when he’s had a punch up both sleeves waiting for you and you’ve never given him an opening to land ’em, when you’ve landed your own little punch an’ he’s goin’ groggy, an’ holdin’ on, an’ the referee’s dragging him off so’s you can go in an’ finish ’m, an’ all the house is shouting an’ tearin’ itself loose, an’ you know you’re the best man, an’ that you played m’ fair an’ won out because you’re the best man.I tell you—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他被自己的滔滔不绝和吉纳维芙那惊慌的表情惊住了，便断断续续地停了下来。他说话的时候，她一直看着他的脸，而她自己的脸上则笼上了恐惧。向她描述那些时刻的时候，他脑海里排满了摇摇晃晃的对手、灯光、呼声四起的赛场。而他从不让她接触到她所不能理解的生活的这一面，这险恶而诱人的一面，跟这比起来，她的爱情是可怜而脆弱的。她熟悉的乔远去了、消失了、不见了。他年轻的孩子气的面庞不见了，温柔的眼睛、甜蜜的弯弯的嘴唇和如画的嘴角都不见了。她看到的是一张男人的面孔，一张钢铁一样的面孔，紧绷着、不可动摇；钢铁一样的嘴，捕兽夹一样的唇，一双钢铁般的眼睛急切地圆睁着，眼里闪烁的光芒如同钢铁在闪闪发光一样。那是一张男人的面孔，而她只认识他男孩的面庞。她根本不认识这张面孔。</td>
		<td class="en">He ceased brokenly, alarmed by his own volubility and by Genevieve’s look of alarm.As he talked she had watched his face while fear dawned in her own.As he described the moment of moments to her, on his inward vision were lined the tottering man, the lights, the shouting house, and he swept out and away from her on this tide of life that was beyond her comprehension, menacing, irresistible, making her love pitiful and weak.The Joe she knew receded, faded, became lost.The fresh boyish face was gone, the tenderness of the eyes, the sweetness of the mouth with its curves and pictured corners.It was a man’s face she saw, a face of steel, tense and immobile; a mouth of steel, the lips like the jaws of a trap; eyes of steel, dilated, intent, and the light in them and the glitter were the light and glitter of steel.The face of a man, and she had known only his boy face.This face she did not know at all.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，虽然这张脸吓到她了，但她也隐约被他身上所体现的自豪感撼动。他的男子气概，那战斗中的男子气概，对她有着难以阻挡的吸引力。作为一个女人，所有的遗传特性都决定了她要寻找一个强壮的男性作为伴侣，以此来仰仗他的力量。她不能理解他存在的这种力量，这种力量比她的爱强大，让他无法抗拒；但是，在一个女人的心里，她感到一种甜蜜的痛苦。这种感受告诉她，为了她、为了爱本身，他已经向她屈服了。他完全放弃了他生活中的那一部分。这是最后一次，以后他决不会再参加拳击比赛了。</td>
		<td class="en">And yet, while it frightened her, she was vaguely stirred with pride in him.His masculinity, the masculinity of the fighting male, made its inevitable appeal to her, a female, moulded by all her heredity to seek out the strong man for mate, and to lean against the wall of his strength.She did not understand this force of his being that rose mightier than her love and laid its compulsion upon him; and yet, in her woman’s heart she was aware of the sweet pang which told her that for her sake, for Love’s own sake, he had surrendered to her, abandoned all that portion of his life, and with this one last fight would never fight again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“西尔弗斯坦夫人可不喜欢职业拳击，”她说，“她反感拳击，但也懂一点儿。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Mrs. Silverstein doesn’t like prize-fighting,” she said.“She’s down on it, and she knows something, too.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他宠溺地笑了笑，以此来掩饰内心的伤痛。这种伤痛已经不新鲜了。他天性和生活中最引以为傲的地方，却一直不被她所欣赏。拳击对他意味着力量，意味着通过自己的努力和辛勤劳动得来的成就。当他把自己和自己的一切都交给吉纳维芙的那一刻，拳击是，也是唯一他有意自豪地展现在她面前的东西。这份工作的好处就在于，它可以为男子气概支付报酬，并且这份报酬比其他任何人愿意支付的都要好、都要多。对他而言，这份工作是他拥有她的正当理由和权利。但她从未理解到这一点，正如她现在还是不能理解一样。他很可能已经考虑过，除此之外，他觉得自己到底还有哪点配得上她。</td>
		<td class="en">He smiled indulgently, concealing a hurt, not altogether new, at her persistent inappreciation of this side of his nature and life in which he took the greatest pride.It was to him power and achievement, earned by his own effort and hard work; and in the moment when he had offered himself and all that he was to Genevieve, it was this, and this alone, that he was proudly conscious of laying at her feet.It was the merit of work performed, a guerdon of manhood finer and greater than any other man could offer, and it had been to him his justification and right to possess her.And she had not understood it then, as she did not understand it now, and he might well have wondered what else she found in him to make him worthy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“西尔弗斯坦夫人是个傻瓜，是个心肠软却吹毛求疵的笨蛋，”他好脾气地说道，“再怎么说，她对这种事又知道什么呢？我跟你说，那是好的，也健康，”——这一想法一直持续到事后。</td>
		<td class="en">“Mrs. Silverstein is a dub, and a softy, and a knocker,” he said good-humoredly.“What’s she know about such things, anyway?I tell you it is good, and healthy, too,”—this last as an afterthought.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“看着我。我想告诉你，要在这种环境中立足，我必须活得干干净净。我活得比她、比她父亲都干净，比你知道的任何人都干净——泡澡、按摩、锻炼、作息规律、吃优质的食物、不大吃大喝、不喝酒、不抽烟、不做任何伤害自己身体的事。咦，我甚至比你活得还要干净，吉纳维芙——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Look at me.I tell you I have to live clean to be in condition like this.I live cleaner than she does, or her old man, or anybody you know—baths, rub-downs, exercise, regular hours, good food and no makin’ a pig of myself, no drinking, no smoking, nothing that’ll hurt me.Why, I live cleaner than you, Genevieve—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“真的，我活得比你还干净，”看到她震惊的面孔，他赶紧又加了一句，“我不是指用水和肥皂，但你看这儿，”他把手虔诚地、坚定地放在她的手臂上。“柔软，你整个都是柔软的，整个都是。跟我不一样。来，你摸一下。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Honest, I do,” he hastened to add at sight of her shocked face.“I don’t mean water an’ soap, but look there.”His hand closed reverently but firmly on her arm.“Soft, you’re all soft, all over.Not like mine.Here, feel this.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他把她的指尖按在自己手臂坚硬的肌肉上，直到她疼得缩回手为止。</td>
		<td class="en">He pressed the ends of her fingers into his hard arm-muscles until she winced from the hurt.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我全身都是如此硬朗，”他继续说，“这就是我说的干净。每一点儿血肉、每一块儿肌肉都干净到骨头里——而且这些骨头也是干净的。水和肥皂只能洗干净皮肤，却不能让人干净到骨头里。告诉你，我的身体摸起来是干净的。它也知道自己本身就是干净的。每天早晨起床去上班，我的每滴血、每块肉都在大声呼喊它们是干净的。哎，我告诉你——”</td>
		<td class="en">“Hard all over just like that,” he went on.“Now that’s what I call clean.Every bit of flesh an’ blood an’ muscle is clean right down to the bones—and they’re clean, too.No soap and water only on the skin, but clean all the way in.I tell you it feels clean.It knows it’s clean itself.When I wake up in the morning an’ go to work, every drop of blood and bit of meat is shouting right out that it is clean.Oh, I tell you—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他突然觉得有些尴尬，便停了下来。他又被自己少有的长篇大论惊住了。在他的生命中，他还从未曾因为被触动而说了那么多话，也从未曾有过什么原因让他如此触动。因为这次是拳击赛受到了质疑，它的真实性和它的价值，拳赛本身，这件世界上最重要的事——或者说曾经是世界上最重要的事。直到那个偶然的下午，那次在西尔弗斯坦的糖果店买东西之后，吉纳维芙一下子在他的生命中异常重要起来，胜过了其他的一切事物。他开始明白，虽然只是模糊地明白，女人和事业之间、世界上男人的工作和女人对男人的需要之间，是存在尖锐冲突的。但他却未能总结。他看见的只是对立，具体的、有血有肉的吉纳维芙与伟大而抽象的、活生生的拳赛之间的对立。它们厌恶彼此，却都对他提出要求；他被这种冲突撕扯，无助地漂浮在它们争夺的洪流中。</td>
		<td class="en">He paused with swift awkwardness, again confounded by his unwonted flow of speech.Never in his life had he been stirred to such utterance, and never in his life had there been cause to be so stirred.For it was the Game that had been questioned, its verity and worth, the Game itself, the biggest thing in the world—or what had been the biggest thing in the world until that chance afternoon and that chance purchase in Silverstein’s candy store, when Genevieve loomed suddenly colossal in his life, overshadowing all other things.He was beginning to see, though vaguely, the sharp conflict between woman and career, between a man’s work in the world and woman’s need of the man.But he was not capable of generalization.He saw only the antagonism between the concrete, flesh-and-blood Genevieve and the great, abstract, living Game.Each resented the other, each claimed him; he was torn with the strife, and yet drifted helpless on the currents of their contention.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的一番话让吉纳维芙盯着他的脸看。她过去喜欢他干净的皮肤、清澈的双眼和女孩子般柔软光洁的脸颊。她意识到了他话里的力量，因而不喜欢他的辩解。她本能地厌恶拳赛。是拳赛把他从她身边拉走，夺走了他属于她的一部分。她理解不了这个对手。也理解不了它的诱惑力。如果她的对手是个女人，是另外一个女孩子的话，那么她在知识、智慧和眼界上都有优势。虽然她确实有这些优势，但她却是在黑暗中和一个她一无所知的无形对手在胡乱争斗。她从他的话中了解到的一些东西让她觉得更加可怕。</td>
		<td class="en">His words had drawn Genevieve’s gaze to his face, and she had pleasured in the clear skin, the clear eyes, the cheek soft and smooth as a girl’s.She saw the force of his argument and disliked it accordingly.She revolted instinctively against this Game which drew him away from her, robbed her of part of him.It was a rival she did not understand.Nor could she understand its seductions.Had it been a woman rival, another girl, knowledge and light and sight would have been hers.As it was, she grappled in the dark with an intangible adversary about which she knew nothing.What truth she felt in his speech made the Game but the more formidable.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她突然意识到自己的软弱。她觉得自己可怜又可悲。她想要他、想要他的全部，哪怕只是少了一点儿，她女性的需求就不能得到满足。她试图用拥抱握紧他，但他左右躲闪地避开了。涌上眼眶的泪水和颤抖的嘴唇使她反败为胜，她用柔弱的力量对抗强大的拳赛。</td>
		<td class="en">A sudden conception of her weakness came to her.She felt pity for herself, and sorrow.She wanted him, all of him, her woman’s need would not be satisfied with less; and he eluded her, slipped away here and there from the embrace with which she tried to clasp him.Tears swam into her eyes, and her lips trembled, turning defeat into victory, routing the all-potent Game with the strength of her weakness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“别哭，吉纳维芙，别哭。”男孩满心忏悔地乞求着。虽然他困惑不已，茫然无措。对他男性的思维来说，她的崩溃和他没什么关系；但是一看到她流泪，这些通通被抛到了九霄云外。</td>
		<td class="en">“Don’t, Genevieve, don’t,” the boy pleaded, all contrition, though he was confused and dazed.To his masculine mind there was nothing relevant about her break-down; yet all else was forgotten at sight of her tears.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她满眼泪光地笑了笑，表示原谅。虽然他不知道有什么要原谅的，但还是完全地融化在她的笑容里。他冲动地想握住她的手，但她的身体突然僵硬，变得冷淡起来，躲开了这一握，一会儿便笑得更灿烂了。</td>
		<td class="en">She smiled forgiveness through her wet eyes, and though he knew of nothing for which to be forgiven, he melted utterly.His hand went out impulsively to hers, but she avoided the clasp by a sort of bodily stiffening and chill, the while the eyes smiled still more gloriously.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“克劳森先生来了。”她说道。同时用一种女人特有的说变就变的戏法，将目光投向来者，再看不出一点泪水的痕迹。</td>
		<td class="en">“Here comes Mr. Clausen,” she said, at the same time, by some transforming alchemy of woman, presenting to the newcomer eyes that showed no hint of moistness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“以为我再也不会回来了吧，乔？”这个面色粉白的部门经理问道。他友好的小眼睛和那严肃的鬓角形成了反差。</td>
		<td class="en">“Think I was never coming back, Joe?” queried the head of the department, a pink-and-white-faced man, whose austere side-whiskers were belied by genial little eyes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“让我想想——哼，对了，我们在讨论染色地毯来着，”他很快接着说，“你看上了那个高雅的小图样，是不是，嗯？嗯，嗯，我什么都知道。我开始做家政时，一周才赚十四块钱。但是你的小爱巢配什么好东西都不过分，对吧？我当然知道。只贵七分钱，依我看，我们关系越好价钱就越便宜。告诉你我打算做什么吧，乔，”——他带着一股慈悲的冲动，秘密地压低了声音——“这是看在你的面子上，我降到五分吧，别人可没这待遇。只要，”——这时他的声音变得尤其严肃起来，给人深刻的印象——“只要你绝不告诉别人你到底付多少。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Now let me see—hum, yes, we was discussing ingrains,” he continued briskly.“That tasty little pattern there catches your eye, don’t it now, eh?Yes, yes, I know all about it.I set up housekeeping when I was getting fourteen a week.But nothing’s too good for the little nest, eh?Of course I know, and it’s only seven cents more, and the dearest is the cheapest, I say.Tell you what I’ll do, Joe,”—this with a burst of philanthropic impulsiveness and a confidential lowering of voice,—“seein’s it’s you, and I wouldn’t do it for anybody else, I’ll reduce it to five cents.Only,”—here his voice became impressively solemn,—“only you mustn’t ever tell how much you really did pay.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“缝纫、上线、安置——这些当然都包含在价钱里，”在乔和吉纳维芙一起商量了一下，宣布了他们的决定之后，他说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Sewed, lined, and laid—of course that’s included,” he said, after Joe and Genevieve had conferred together and announced their decision.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“小爱巢，啊？”他问道，“你什么时候大展拳脚？明天！这么快？太棒了！太棒了！”</td>
		<td class="en">“And the little nest, eh?” he queried.“When do you spread your wings and fly away?To-morrow!So soon?Beautiful!Beautiful!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他欣喜若狂地转了一会儿眼珠，然后像父亲一样面带微笑地看着他们。</td>
		<td class="en">He rolled his eyes ecstatically for a moment, then beamed upon them with a fatherly air.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >乔回答得很坚决，吉纳维芙则羞红了脸；但他俩都觉得他的做法不太合适。不仅仅因为这个话题是私密而神圣的，对于中产阶级这可能是一种过分拘谨的行为，然而对于追求严谨生活且品行端正的工人阶级，这种行为却是一种谦逊和沉默的表现。</td>
		<td class="en">Joe had replied sturdily enough, and Genevieve had blushed prettily; but both felt that it was not exactly proper.Not alone because of the privacy and holiness of the subject, but because of what might have been prudery in the middle class, but which in them was the modesty and reticence found in individuals of the working class when they strive after clean living and morality.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >克劳森先生一路堆笑地陪着他们走到电梯口，说着欢迎再次光临的话，像做慈善一样。乔一路走过去，那些雇员就盯着他远去的背影。</td>
		<td class="en">Mr. Clausen accompanied them to the elevator, all smiles, patronage, and beneficence, while the clerks turned their heads to follow Joe’s retreating figure.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“今天晚上怎么样，乔？”等电梯的时候，克劳森先生不安地问道，“你感觉怎么样？觉得能打败他吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“And to-night, Joe?”Mr. Clausen asked anxiously, as they waited at the shaft.“How do you feel?Think you’ll do him?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“当然，”乔回答道，“这辈子还没感觉这么好过呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Sure,” Joe answered.“Never felt better in my life.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你觉得没问题，对吧？太好了！太好了！</td>
		<td class="en">“You feel all right, eh?Good!Good!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >嗯，我只是在想——你懂的，哈哈！——你就要结婚了，那以后——我还以为你可能有点松懈，嗯，是不是有点儿？——精神稍微有点不那么集中，你懂的。我可知道快结婚是个什么感觉。</td>
		<td class="en">You see, I was just a-wonderin’—you know, ha! ha!—goin’ to get married and the rest—thought you might be unstrung, eh, a trifle?—nerves just a bit off, you know.Know how gettin’ married is myself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但你没问题的，对吧？你当然没问题。根本不用问你。哈！哈！</td>
		<td class="en">But you’re all right, eh?Of course you are.No use asking you that.Ha! ha!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >嗯，祝你好运，孩子！我就知道你会赢的。一点儿问题都没有，当然，当然。”</td>
		<td class="en">Well, good luck, my boy!I know you’ll win.Never had the least doubt, of course, of course.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“再见，普里查德小姐，”他边对吉纳维芙说着，边殷勤地送她进电梯。“希望你们常常打电话给我。乐意接待——乐意之极——我向你们保证。”</td>
		<td class="en">“And good-by, Miss Pritchard,” he said to Genevieve, gallantly handing her into the elevator.“Hope you call often.Will be charmed—charmed—I assure you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“大家都叫你‘乔’，”她语气责备地说道，这时电梯正往下降。“他们为什么不叫你‘弗莱明先生’？那再合适不过了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Everybody calls you ‘Joe’,” she said reproachfully, as the car dropped downward.“Why don’t they call you ‘Mr. Fleming’?That’s no more than proper.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但他正心绪不宁地盯着电梯操作员，似乎没有听见她的话。</td>
		<td class="en">But he was staring moodily at the elevator boy and did not seem to hear.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“怎么了，乔？”她温柔地问道。她非常清楚，这种温柔的力量能让他激动起来。</td>
		<td class="en">“What’s the matter, Joe?” she asked, with a tenderness the power of which to thrill him she knew full well.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗯，没什么，”他说，“我只是在想——在盼望着。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, nothing,” he said.“I was only thinking—and wishing.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“盼望着？——盼望什么？”她的声音对他来说，本身就是一种诱惑，她的眼睛能够让他更温柔，但这些都未能引起他的注意力。</td>
		<td class="en">“Wishing?—what?”Her voice was seduction itself, and her eyes would have melted stronger than he, though they failed in calling his up to them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后，他有意抬起眼来，看向她的眼睛。“我希望你能来看我比赛，就一次。”</td>
		<td class="en">Then, deliberately, his eyes lifted to hers.“I was wishing you could see me fight just once.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她做了一个表示厌恶的动作。他的脸沉了下来。她突然意识到她的对手已经插进他们之间，正在夺走他。</td>
		<td class="en">She made a gesture of disgust, and his face fell.It came to her sharply that the rival had thrust between and was bearing him away.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我——我愿意去看，”她急急地说道，仿佛努力地想要寻求一种同情。这种同情会让最坚强的男人变得脆弱，让他们将头依靠在女人的胸脯上。</td>
		<td class="en">“I—I’d like to,” she said hastily with an effort, striving after that sympathy which weakens the strongest men and draws their heads to women’s breasts.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“真的？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Will you?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他又抬起眼来看向她的双眼。他是认真的——她知道。这似乎在挑战她的爱到底有多伟大。</td>
		<td class="en">Again his eyes lifted and looked into hers.He meant it—she knew that.It seemed a challenge to the greatness of her love.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那将会是我生命中最骄傲的时刻。”他坦白地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“It would be the proudest moment of my life,” he said simply.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这可能就是爱的忧愁，想要满足他同情她的这一需要，以及为了开拓眼界而想亲眼看看拳赛的渴望——也许这动人的号召是一种冒险，它穿透平静生活中狭窄的界限；因为有一股巨大的勇气让她振奋，她坦白地回答道：“我会去的。”</td>
		<td class="en">It may have been the apprehensiveness of love, the wish to meet his need for her sympathy, and the desire to see the Game face to face for wisdom’s sake,—and it may have been the clarion call of adventure ringing through the narrow confines of uneventful existence; for a great daring thrilled through her, and she said, just as simply, “I will.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吉纳维芙和乔是工人阶级里的贵族。在一个满是污秽的恶劣环境里，他们却保持了自身的清白与健康。他们自尊自重，注重生活中美好干净的事物，这使得他们与众不同。他们不轻易交朋友，也没有真正的密友，就是那种心灵相通、有相同之处的密友。他们有着很强的社交本能，但却始终孤独，因为他们无法在满足那种本能的同时满足对干净体面的渴望。</td>
		<td class="en">Genevieve and Joe were working-class aristocrats.In an environment made up largely of sordidness and wretchedness they had kept themselves unsullied and wholesome.Theirs was a self-respect, a regard for the niceties and clean things of life, which had held them aloof from their kind.Friends did not come to them easily; nor had either ever possessed a really intimate friend, a heart-companion with whom to chum and have things in common.The social instinct was strong in them, yet they had remained lonely because they could not satisfy that instinct and at that same time satisfy their desire for cleanness and decency.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果工人阶级里有一个女孩过着备受呵护的生活，那她就是吉纳维芙。在粗暴无情的环境中，她却避开了所有粗暴与无情。她只看她愿意看到的，并且永远只愿意看到最好的，如同本能一样，轻易地就远离了劣等粗糙的事物。从一开始，她就受到了特别的保护。她是家里唯一的孩子，又有个病弱的母亲要照顾，所以她从不上街和邻居的孩子们嬉戏打闹。她的父亲，是个脾气温和、胸部狭窄、患有贫血症的小职员，因为天性不太合群，总是呆在家里，他把所有的工作都转向为家庭营造一种甜蜜温馨的气氛。</td>
		<td class="en">If ever a girl of the working class had led the sheltered life, it was Genevieve.In the midst of roughness and brutality, she had shunned all that was rough and brutal.She saw but what she chose to see, and she chose always to see the best, avoiding coarseness and uncouthness without effort, as a matter of instinct.To begin with, she had been peculiarly unexposed.An only child, with an invalid mother upon whom she attended, she had not joined in the street games and frolics of the children of the neighbourhood.Her father, a mild-tempered, narrow-chested, anæmic little clerk, domestic because of his inherent disability to mix with men, had done his full share toward giving the home an atmosphere of sweetness and tenderness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吉纳维芙十二岁就成了孤儿，父亲的葬礼结束后，她就直接和西尔弗斯坦一家人住在糖果店楼上的房间里。她在那儿受这家善良的外国人的保护，通过看店赚取自己的生活费和买衣服的钱。虽然并非犹太人，但西尔弗斯坦一家人却少不了她，因为在安息日到来之时他们自己不看店做生意。</td>
		<td class="en">An orphan at twelve, Genevieve had gone straight from her father’s funeral to live with the Silversteins in their rooms above the candy store; and here, sheltered by kindly aliens, she earned her keep and clothes by waiting on the shop.Being Gentile, she was especially necessary to the Silversteins, who would not run the business themselves when the day of their Sabbath came round.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在这间平静的小店里，六个年头悄然而逝。她认识的人寥寥无几。因为没有令她满意的女孩子，她从不和女孩子们结为密友。她也不愿意和她的邻居，那些小伙子们一起出去，尽管那是女孩子十五岁以后的惯常做法。“那个高傲的娃娃脸。”邻居的女孩子们这么形容她。虽然她的美丽和高傲招致她们的嫉妒，但依然也赢得她们的尊重。“完美无瑕。”年轻的男孩子都这么叫她——虽然总是很小声地在他们内部说，怕引起其他女孩的忿怒，但他们都很敬畏吉纳维芙，以一种朦胧的宗教形式，仿佛她神秘、美丽、不可接近似的。</td>
		<td class="en">And here, in the uneventful little shop, six maturing years had slipped by.Her acquaintances were few.She had elected to have no girl chum for the reason that no satisfactory girl had appeared.Nor did she choose to walk with the young fellows of the neighbourhood, as was the custom of girls from their fifteenth year.“That stuck-up doll-face,” was the way the girls of the neighbourhood described her; and though she earned their enmity by her beauty and aloofness, she none the less commanded their respect.“Peaches and cream,” she was called by the young men—though softly and amongst themselves, for they were afraid of arousing the ire of the other girls, while they stood in awe of Genevieve, in a dimly religious way, as a something mysteriously beautiful and unapproachable.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因为她确实很美丽。她拥有纯正的美洲血统，是那些伟大的工人阶级之中一朵罕见的花朵，美貌足以藐视所有她的前辈和周围的人们，理由显而易见,不用任何解释。她的肤色很美。血液流经雪白的肌肤，显出的颜色如此美丽诱人，为她赢得了那个恰当的描述，“完美无瑕”。她相貌端庄美丽；只因为她气质中所带有的娇美，也无愧“美人”这个称号了。安静、低声细语、庄严、高贵，她不知怎么掌握了着装的诀窍，无论穿什么都只适合她的美丽和高贵。此外，她具有十足的女性特质，温柔而执着，既有成为一名伴侣潜在的激情又有作为一个女人所拥有的母性。但她天性中的这一面这些年来却一直处于沉醉状态，在等待着她的白马王子的出现。</td>
		<td class="en">For she was indeed beautiful.Springing from a long line of American descent, she was one of those wonderful working-class blooms which occasionally appear, defying all precedent of forebears and environment, apparently without cause or explanation.She was a beauty in color, the blood spraying her white skin so deliciously as to earn for her the apt description, “peaches and cream.”She was a beauty in the regularity of her features; and, if for no other reason, she was a beauty in the mere delicacy of the lines on which she was moulded.Quiet, low-voiced, stately, and dignified, she somehow had the knack of dress, and but befitted her beauty and dignity with anything she put on.Withal, she was sheerly feminine, tender and soft and clinging, with the smouldering passion of the mate and the motherliness of the woman.But this side of her nature had lain dormant through the years, waiting for the mate to appear.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Then Joe came into Silverstein’s shop one hot Saturday afternoon to cool himself with ice-cream soda.She had not noticed his entrance, being busy with one other customer, an urchin of six or seven who gravely analyzed his desires before the show-case wherein truly generous and marvellous candy creations reposed under a cardboard announcement, “Five for Five Cents.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她听到他说：“请给我冰淇林苏打水。”她没看他的脸，就问：“什么口味？”说到这一点，她没有注意年轻男孩子的习惯。关于这些男孩子，有些事她不能理解。他们看她的方式让她觉得不舒服，她不知道为什么；他们有些粗野低俗，她不喜欢。迄今为止，她的想象从未被男人触动过。她所见过的小伙子们对她都没什么吸引力，也没什么意义。总之，要是问她世界上为什么要有男人，她会迷惑不已，不知道该怎么回答。</td>
		<td class="en">She had heard, “Ice-cream soda, please,” and had herself asked, “What flavor?” without seeing his face.For that matter, it was not a custom of hers to notice young men.There was something about them she did not understand.The way they looked at her made her uncomfortable, she knew not why; while there was an uncouthness and roughness about them that did not please her.As yet, her imagination had been untouched by man.The young fellows she had seen had held no lure for her, had been without meaning to her.In short, had she been asked to give one reason for the existence of men on the earth, she would have been nonplussed for a reply.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">As she emptied the measure of ice-cream into the glass, her casual glance rested on Joe’s face, and she experienced on the instant a pleasant feeling of satisfaction.The next instant his eyes were upon her face, her eyes had dropped, and she was turning away toward the soda fountain.But at the fountain, filling the glass, she was impelled to look at him again—but for no more than an instant, for this time she found his eyes already upon her, waiting to meet hers, while on his face was a frankness of interest that caused her quickly to look away.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她会因为一个男人很高兴，这一点让她很震惊。“这男孩子长得真好看，”她暗自想着，却出于本能，单纯地试着去避开那纯粹的漂亮背后吸引和控制她的力量。“不，他并不好看，”她一边想着一边把杯子放在他面前，收了一块一角的硬币，又第三次看进了他的眼睛。她词汇有限，对言语的价值也知之甚少；但是他男孩的面孔上那强烈的男子气概告诉她好看这个词不太合适。</td>
		<td class="en">That such pleasingness would reside for her in any man astonished her.“What a pretty boy,” she thought to herself, innocently and instinctively trying to ward off the power to hold and draw her that lay behind the mere prettiness.“Besides, he isn’t pretty,” she thought, as she placed the glass before him, received the silver dime in payment, and for the third time looked into his eyes.Her vocabulary was limited, and she knew little of the worth of words; but the strong masculinity of his boy’s face told her that the term was inappropriate.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“He must be handsome, then,” was her next thought, as she again dropped her eyes before his.But all good-looking men were called handsome, and that term, too, displeased her.But whatever it was, he was good to see, and she was irritably aware of a desire to look at him again and again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对于乔来说，他还从未见过一个女孩子像柜台对面的这个的女孩子那样。但是在自然哲学上，他比她聪明，能够立即给出地球上为什么要有女人的原因。不过，女人从来不是他世界的一部分。他的想象也从未被女人触动过，就像她的也从未被男人触动过一样。但是现在他的想象却被触动了，而那个女人就是吉纳维芙。他从来没有想象过一个女孩子能够那么美丽，美丽得他都移不开眼。然而每次两人目光相交，他就会感到一种令人不快的尴尬，要是她没有那么快就低下眼帘，他早就看向别处了。</td>
		<td class="en">As for Joe, he had never seen anything like this girl across the counter.While he was wiser in natural philosophy than she, and could have given immediately the reason for woman’s existence on the earth, nevertheless woman had no part in his cosmos.His imagination was as untouched by woman as the girl’s was by man.But his imagination was touched now, and the woman was Genevieve.He had never dreamed a girl could be so beautiful, and he could not keep his eyes from her face.Yet every time he looked at her, and her eyes met his, he felt painful embarrassment, and would have looked away had not her eyes dropped so quickly.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But when, at last, she slowly lifted her eyes and held their gaze steadily, it was his own eyes that dropped, his own cheek that mantled red.She was much less embarrassed than he, while she betrayed her embarrassment not at all.She was aware of a flutter within, such as she had never known before, but in no way did it disturb her outward serenity.Joe, on the contrary, was obviously awkward and delightfully miserable.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Neither knew love, and all that either was aware was an overwhelming desire to look at the other.Both had been troubled and roused, and they were drawing together with the sharpness and imperativeness of uniting elements.He toyed with his spoon, and flushed his embarrassment over his soda, but lingered on; and she spoke softly, dropped her eyes, and wove her witchery about him.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But he could not linger forever over a glass of ice-cream soda, while he did not dare ask for a second glass.So he left her to remain in the shop in a waking trance, and went away himself down the street like a somnambulist.Genevieve dreamed through the afternoon and knew that she was in love.Not so with Joe.He knew only that he wanted to look at her again, to see her face.His thoughts did not get beyond this, and besides, it was scarcely a thought, being more a dim and inarticulate desire.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她急忙跑到窥孔那里，发现自己正对着拳击台。她能看到整个拳击台，尽管有一些观众被挡在视野之外。高处的一束专利煤气喷灯把拳击台照得很亮。她已经挤过了头一排的人们。由于他们手中拿着纸笔，她判断这些人是来自当地住宅区的一些记者。其中一个人嚼着口香糖。她能辨认出在他们后面两排的座位上有附近消防站的消防员，还有几个穿着制服的警察。头一排的中间坐着年轻的警长，左右两边围着一群记者。她瞥见克劳森先生出现在拳台的另一边，这着实让她吃了一惊。他紧挨着拳台前沿坐着，粉白色的脸上长着络腮胡子，神色严峻。在同是前排的更远一些位子上，她看到了西尔弗斯坦。他干瘪的脸上洋溢着期待的神色。</td>
		<td class="en">She hurried to the peep-hole, and found herself against the ring.She could see the whole of it, though part of the audience was shut off.The ring was well lighted by an overhead cluster of patent gas-burners.The front row of the men she had squeezed past, because of their paper and pencils, she decided to be reporters from the local papers up-town.One of them was chewing gum.Behind them, on the other two rows of seats, she could make out firemen from the near-by engine-house and several policemen in uniform.In the middle of the front row, flanked by the reporters, sat the young chief of police.She was startled by catching sight of Mr. Clausen on the opposite side of the ring.There he sat, austere, side-whiskered, pink and white, close up against the front of the ring.Several seats farther on, in the same front row, she discovered Silverstein, his weazen features glowing with anticipation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >几阵欢呼声中，一些年轻小伙子出现了。他们穿着衬衫，拿着水桶、瓶子、毛巾，爬过绳子，走到她的对角。其中一个坐到了凳子上，屈身倚在围绳上。她看到他光着腿，脚上穿着帆布鞋，身上裹着一件厚重的白毛衣。同时，另一拨人占据了紧挨着她的场角。更大的欢呼声吸引了她的注意力。她看到乔坐在凳子上，身上还穿着浴袍。他那短短的栗色卷发在距她眼睛不到三英尺的地方。</td>
		<td class="en">A few cheers heralded the advent of several young fellows, in shirt-sleeves, carrying buckets, bottles, and towels, who crawled through the ropes and crossed to the diagonal corner from her.One of them sat down on a stool and leaned back against the ropes.She saw that he was bare-legged, with canvas shoes on his feet, and that his body was swathed in a heavy white sweater.In the meantime another group had occupied the corner directly against her.Louder cheers drew her attention to it, and she saw Joe seated on a stool still clad in the bath robe, his short chestnut curls within a yard of her eyes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个穿着黑色套装、头发蓬乱、衣领高挺而离奇古怪的年轻男人走到拳击台中央，举起了手。</td>

		<td class="en">“Gentlemen will please stop smoking,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的努力换来了一阵抱怨和嘘声。她感到愤怒，因为她发现并没有人停止抽烟。说这句话时，克劳森先生指间正夹着一支点燃的火柴。接着他平静地点上了雪茄。那一刻，她感到讨厌克劳森先生。她的乔怎么能在这种环境下打比赛呢？她才刚刚坐下，就已经觉得难以呼吸。</td>
		<td class="en">His effort was applauded by groans and cat-calls, and she noticed with indignation that nobody stopped smoking.Mr. Clausen held a burning match in his fingers while the announcement was being made, and then calmly lighted his cigar.She felt that she hated him in that moment.How was her Joe to fight in such an atmosphere?She could scarcely breathe herself, and she was only sitting down.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >解说员走向乔。乔站了起来。他脱下浴袍，径直走到拳台中央，除了一双低帮的帆布鞋和一块窄窄的白色裆布之外，全身赤裸。吉纳维芙惊讶得眼珠子都要掉出来了。她独自坐着，没有人能看见她，但她还是因为看到爱人那美丽的酮体而羞得脸颊发烫。可她怀着罪恶感再次望向了乔。她感到罪恶，因为她的快乐正来自于看着这她明知是禁忌的景象。她体内那股难以名状的跃动和面对他而起的冲动一定是罪恶的。但这罪恶是美妙的，她不想闭上眼睛。格伦迪太太对她的劝告都白费了。她体内的异教徒、原罪和所有的天性都在怂恿着她继续看下去。过去的一切好像母亲一样对她私语，而那些怂恿她的力量像未出生的孩子一样喧闹不停。而她对这些一无所知。她只知道这是罪恶的。她骄傲地抬起头，在一阵强烈的反抗情绪中，决定不顾一切地去犯错，并将这种错误延伸到极致。</td>
		<td class="en">The announcer came over to Joe.He stood up.His bath robe fell away from him, and he stepped forth to the centre of the ring, naked save for the low canvas shoes and a narrow hip-cloth of white.Genevieve’s eyes dropped.She sat alone, with none to see, but her face was burning with shame at sight of the beautiful nakedness of her lover.But she looked again, guiltily, for the joy that was hers in beholding what she knew must be sinful to behold.The leap of something within her and the stir of her being toward him must be sinful.But it was delicious sin, and she did not deny her eyes.In vain Mrs. Grundy admonished her.The pagan in her, original sin, and all nature urged her on.The mothers of all the past were whispering through her, and there was a clamour of the children unborn.But of this she knew nothing.She knew only that it was sin, and she lifted her head proudly, recklessly resolved, in one great surge of revolt, to sin to the uttermost.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她过去从未幻想过衣衫之下的躯体。除了手和脸之外，躯体的其他部分都未曾在她的脑海中出现过。作为一个活在以衣着整齐为文明的环境中的孩子，对她来说，衣服就是一个人的躯体。在她看来，男人这一种族就是一个有手和脸，头部还覆盖着毛发的两足动物。当她想到乔的时候，脑海中立即出现的是那个穿着衣服的乔——脸色娇嫩、眼睛蔚蓝、一头卷发，但是穿着衣服的。但他现在几乎全身赤裸地站在那儿，在那白色灯光的照耀下，像神一样。她从未想过神的躯体，除了隐隐约约地觉得神是赤裸的之外。这个联想吓她一跳。她觉得自己的罪恶好像还带有亵渎神明的成分。</td>
		<td class="en">She had never dreamed of the form under the clothes.The form, beyond the hands and the face, had no part in her mental processes.A child of garmented civilization, the garment was to her the form.The race of men was to her a race of garmented bipeds, with hands and faces and hair-covered heads.When she thought of Joe, the Joe instantly visualized on her mind was a clothed Joe—girl-cheeked, blue-eyed, curly-headed, but clothed.And there he stood, all but naked, godlike, in a white blaze of light.She had never conceived of the form of God except as nebulously naked, and the thought-association was startling.It seemed to her that her sin partook of sacrilege or blasphemy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她对色彩敏感的程度超过了她的受教育程度。这种感觉告诉她，这是美、是奇迹。她过去一直都喜欢乔的样貌，但这都是衣服展示出来的样貌。乔的衣着曾让她赏心悦目，因为他总是穿得那么整洁，那么有品位。她以前从未想过隐藏在衣服之下的身体。这令她目眩。他的皮肤像女人的一样白皙，甚至比女人的皮肤还要光滑，白色的光泽里根本看不见一丝毛发。她察觉到了这一点。但所有其余的部分，那完美的线条、力量和伸展，让她感到一种无故的愉悦。这其中有种洁净和优雅的感觉。他的脸像浮雕，微笑中张开的嘴唇又显得非常孩子气。</td>
		<td class="en">Her chromo-trained æsthetic sense exceeded its education and told her that here were beauty and wonder.She had always liked the physical presentment of Joe, but it was a presentment of clothes, and she had thought the pleasingness of it due to the neatness and taste with which he dressed.She had never dreamed that this lurked beneath.It dazzled her.His skin was fair as a woman’s, far more satiny, and no rudimentary hair-growth marred its white lustre.This she perceived, but all the rest, the perfection of line and strength and development, gave pleasure without her knowing why.There was a cleanness and grace about it.His face was like a cameo, and his lips, parted in a smile, made it very boyish.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >解说员把手放到他肩上，说道：“乔·弗莱明，西奥克兰的骄傲！”这时，乔正面向观众微笑着。</td>
		<td class="en">He smiled as he faced the audience, when the announcer, placing a hand on his shoulder, said: “Joe Fleming, the Pride of West Oakland.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >欢呼声和掌声如雷鸣般响起。她听到热情的呼喊声“啊！乔！”人们一遍又一遍地朝他呐喊。</td>
		<td class="en">Cheers and hand-clappings stormed up, and she heard affectionate cries of “Oh, you, Joe!”Men shouted it at him again and again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他走回自己的场角。那一刻，她觉得乔比任何时候都更不像个拳击手。他的眼睛太温柔了，没有一丝兽性，脸上也是一样。而他的身体看上去又是那么纤弱、白皙、光滑。还有他过于孩子气的脸庞，显得聪明且脾气很好。她没有专家一样的眼光，不会洞察到他宽阔的胸膛、宽大的鼻孔、复原能力强的肺部，还有那绸缎般表皮下的肌肉——像能量的储窖一样，隐藏着具有毁灭性的化学物质。在她眼中，他就像是德雷斯顿的瓷器，要小心照料,而一次重触就有可能让它破成碎片。</td>
		<td class="en">He walked back to his corner.Never to her did he seem less a fighter than then.His eyes were too mild; there was not a spark of the beast in them, nor in his face, while his body seemed too fragile, what of its fairness and smoothness, and his face too boyish and sweet-tempered and intelligent.She did not have the expert’s eye for the depth of chest, the wide nostrils, the recuperative lungs, and the muscles under their satin sheaths—crypts of energy wherein lurked the chemistry of destruction.To her he looked like a something of Dresden china, to be handled gently and with care, liable to be shattered to fragments by the first rough touch.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在两个助手的连拉带拽下，约翰·庞塔脱下了他的白毛衣，来到拳击台中央。一看到此人，她便明白了什么是恐惧。这是个典型的拳击手——一个野兽，脑门上有条横纹，低低的浓眉下是一双锐利的眼睛、塌鼻子、厚嘴唇、阴沉的嘴。他下颚宽厚，脖子像牛一样粗壮，那头直直的短发在她惊恐的眼中就像猪背上僵硬的鬃毛。这是粗俗，是兽性——一个野蛮、原始、凶残的东西。他皮肤十分黝黑，身上长满毛发，胸口和肩上的毛发像狗毛一样乱成一团。他胸膛宽阔、双腿粗壮、肌肉大块但不明显。他的肌肉结成块状，身上疙疙瘩瘩，多余的力量让他身体扭曲，毫无美感。</td>
		<td class="en">John Ponta, stripped of his white sweater by the pulling and hauling of two of his seconds, came to the centre of the ring.She knew terror as she looked at him.Here was the fighter—the beast with a streak for a forehead, with beady eyes under lowering and bushy brows, flat-nosed, thick-lipped, sullen-mouthed.He was heavy-jawed, bull-necked, and the short, straight hair of the head seemed to her frightened eyes the stiff bristles on a hog’s back.Here were coarseness and brutishness—a thing savage, primordial, ferocious.He was swarthy to blackness, and his body was covered with a hairy growth that matted like a dog’s on his chest and shoulders.He was deep-chested, thick-legged, large-muscled, but unshapely.His muscles were knots, and he was gnarled and knobby, twisted out of beauty by excess of strength.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“约翰·庞塔，来自韦斯特贝竞技俱乐部。”解说员说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“John Ponta, West Bay Athletic Club,” said the announcer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他引起的欢呼声比乔小多了。很明显，人们在情感上都是支持乔的。</td>

		<td class="en">“Go in an’ eat ’m, Ponta! Eat' m up!" a voice shouted in the lull.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人们对此回以轻蔑地叫喊和不满地牢骚。庞塔不喜欢这样。因为当他走回自己场角时，他阴沉的嘴巴扭动着，发出粗重愤怒的声音。他身上的返祖现象过于明显，所以很难博得观众的赞美。人们本能地讨厌他。他是一头没有智慧和精神的动物，一个令人恐惧的危险物。就像老虎和蛇是令人害怕的危险物那样，人们更希望看到它们被锁在笼子里面，而不想让它们在外面到处乱跑。</td>
		<td class="en">This was received by scornful cries and groans.He did not like it, for his sullen mouth twisted into a half-snarl as he went back to his corner.He was too decided an atavism to draw the crowd’s admiration.Instinctively the crowd disliked him.He was an animal, lacking in intelligence and spirit, a menace and a thing of fear, as the tiger and the snake are menaces and things of fear, better behind the bars of a cage than running free in the open.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他感到观众对他并没有兴趣。他就像被敌人环绕的困兽，于是转过身恶狠狠地瞪着他们。小西尔弗斯坦正极度高兴地喊着乔的名字，但一见庞塔的眼神就吓得躲开了。他被那凶猛的怒火镇住了，声音咯咯地消失在喉咙里。吉纳维芙看到了这小插曲。而当庞塔的双眼慢慢扫过讨厌他的观众们的拳台周围，与她的眼神相会时，她也被镇住了，吓得缩了回去。这眼神扫过人群，然后久久地停在了乔的身上。她觉得庞塔好像正使他自己陷入了暴怒。乔用他那温和的孩子气的目光作出了回应，但他的脸色变得严肃起来。</td>
		<td class="en">And he felt that the crowd had no relish for him.He was like an animal in the circle of its enemies, and he turned and glared at them with malignant eyes.Little Silverstein, shouting out Joe’s name with high glee, shrank away from Ponta’s gaze, shrivelled as in fierce heat, the sound gurgling and dying in his throat.Genevieve saw the little by-play, and as Ponta’s eyes slowly swept round the circle of their hate and met hers, she, too, shrivelled and shrank back.The next moment they were past, pausing to centre long on Joe.It seemed to her that Ponta was working himself into a rage.Joe returned the gaze with mild boy’s eyes, but his face grew serious.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在解说员的陪同下，第三个人来到拳台中央。这是一个穿着衬衫的年轻人，面色和善。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两个选手都在助手的帮助下戴着手套，庞塔的一个助手在乔戴上手套之前走了过来，检查了一番乔的手套。裁判把他们叫到赛场的中央。助手们也都跟着，他们人可真不少。乔和庞塔面对面站着，裁判在他们中间。助手们则靠在一起，把手搭在彼此肩上，向前伸着脖子。裁判在说着些什么，所有人都聚精会神地听着。</td>
		<td class="en">Both men were being helped into the gloves by their seconds, and one of Ponta’s seconds came over and examined the gloves before they went on Joe’s hands.The referee called them to the centre of the ring.The seconds followed, and they made quite a group, Joe and Ponta facing each other, the referee in the middle, the seconds leaning with hands on one another’s shoulders, their heads craned forward.The referee was talking, and all listened attentively.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人群散开了。解说员再次来到台前。</td>
		<td class="en">The group broke up.Again the announcer came to the front.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Joe Fleming fights at one hundred and twenty-eight,” he said; “John Ponta at one hundred and forty.

There are no draws fought before this club.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他爬过场边的围绳，从拳击台跳到地上。助手们拿着凳子和水桶从围绳间迅速离开拳击台，于是场角上一阵忙乱。拳台中央只剩两名拳击手和那个裁判。一声锣响。两个男人快步向前走到场地中央。他们伸出右手，敷衍地飞快握了个手。然后，庞塔从左右两边凶狠地打出重拳，乔后跳一步躲开了。庞塔像一枚射弹那样紧追着乔，向他猛扑过去。</td>
		<td class="en">He crawled through the ropes and dropped from the ring to the floor.There was a scuttling in the corners as the seconds cleared out through the ropes, taking with them the stools and buckets.Only remained in the ring the two fighters and the referee.A gong sounded.The two men advanced rapidly to the centre.Their right hands extended and for a fraction of an instant met in a perfunctory shake.Then Ponta lashed out, savagely, right and left, and Joe escaped by springing back.Like a projectile, Ponta hurled himself after him and upon him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >拳赛在继续。吉纳维芙一只手紧紧揪着胸口，就这么看着。她被庞塔那迅猛凶残的攻势和他那多次挥出的扫击给弄懵了。她觉得乔一定要输了。有时，她都看不到乔的脸，他的脸在飞闪着的手套中模糊不清。但她能听到响亮的挥拳声，每一声都让她胃的深处感到一阵恶心。她不知道她听到的只是手套撞击手套、手套撞击肩膀的声音，对人并没有伤害。</td>
		<td class="en">The fight was on.Genevieve clutched one hand to her breast and watched.She was bewildered by the swiftness and savagery of Ponta’s assault, and by the multitude of blows he struck.She felt that Joe was surely being destroyed.At times she could not see his face, so obscured was it by the flying gloves.But she could hear the resounding blows, and with the sound of each blow she felt a sickening sensation in the pit of her stomach.She did not know that what she heard was the impact of glove on glove, or glove on shoulder, and that no damage was being done.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >突然间，她意识到比赛出现了转折。两个人都死死地抱住对方，完全没有挥拳。她看出这就是乔向她描述过的“扭抱”。庞塔挣扎着想要脱身，乔坚持不放。</td>
		<td class="en">She was suddenly aware that a change had come over the fight.Both men were clutching each other in a tense embrace; no blows were being struck at all.She recognized it to be what Joe had described to her as the “clinch.”Ponta was struggling to free himself, Joe was holding on.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >裁判喊道：“分开！”乔费了些劲才放开手，但庞塔仍有一只手可以出击，于是乔为了避拳又赶紧回去再次抱住他。但她注意到，这一次乔用拳击手套的下部抵住了庞塔的嘴和下巴。在裁判员喊出第二声“分开！”时，乔将对手的头向后猛推，自己全身而退。</td>
		<td class="en">The referee shouted, “Break!”Joe made an effort to get away, but Ponta got one hand free and Joe rushed back into a second clinch, to escape the blow.But this time, she noticed, the heel of his glove was pressed against Ponta’s mouth and chin, and at the second “Break!” of the referee, Joe shoved his opponent’s head back and sprang clear himself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >短短的几秒钟，她清楚地看到了她的爱人。他蹲伏着，左脚微微向前，膝盖微曲，头埋在两肩中间。他的双手放在身前的位置，准备着攻击或是防守。他身上的肌肉紧绷着，当他走来走去时，她就能看到那些肌肉在他白色的皮肤下结聚成团，像活物一样扭动、爬行。</td>
		<td class="en">For a brief several seconds she had an unobstructed view of her lover.Left foot a trifle advanced, knees slightly bent, he was crouching, with his head drawn well down between his shoulders and shielded by them.His hands were in position before him, ready either to attack or defend.The muscles of his body were tense, and as he moved about she could see them bunch up and writhe and crawl like live things under the white skin.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但庞塔又一次扑到他身上，他在想办法挣脱。他稍稍弓着身子，更加缩紧了身体，用他的手、胳膊肘和前臂来掩护。拳头像雨点一样打在他身上。在她看来，他好像就要被打死了。</td>
		<td class="en">But again Ponta was upon him and he was struggling to live.He crouched a bit more, drew his body more compactly together, and covered up with his hands, elbows, and forearms.Blows rained upon him, and it looked to her as though he were being beaten to death.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但他用手套和肩膀来承受那些击打，在其中左右摇摆，像暴风雨中的一颗树。全场观众都高兴得欢呼起来。直到她明白了这种欢呼，看见西尔弗斯坦疯了一样地开心得几乎从椅子上激烈地站了起来，并听到许多声“啊！好样的乔！”，她才明白，乔没有被痛击，而是表现得很出色。接着他会再冒出来一下，然后再次包住自己，在庞塔凶猛的旋风中躲避着。</td>
		<td class="en">But he was receiving the blows on his gloves and shoulders, rocking back and forth to the force of them like a tree in a storm, while the house cheered its delight.It was not until she understood this applause, and saw Silverstein half out of his seat and intensely, madly happy, and heard the “Oh, you, Joe’s!” from many throats, that she realized that instead of being cruelly punished he was acquitting himself well.Then he would emerge for a moment, again to be enveloped and hidden in the whirlwind of Ponta’s ferocity.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >又是一声锣响。他们好像已经打了半个小时那么久，尽管从乔之前跟她说的看来，她知道现在只过了三分钟而已。随着那声锣响，乔的助手们抓紧那宝贵的休息时间，翻过围绳，拥着他来到他的场角。一个人蹲在地板上，这个人的两边是乔伸开的两腿，他把它们抬起来放在自己的膝盖上，猛烈地摩擦着。乔坐在凳子上，身体后倾着倚靠在场角，头向后耷拉着，胳膊伸开搭在围绳上，好让胸部放松伸展一下。他大张着嘴，一边透过两个助手递过来的毛巾呼吸着，一边听着另一个助手在他耳边小声提出的计策，助手同时还用海绵擦拭他的脸、肩膀和胸部。</td>
		<td class="en">The gong sounded.It seemed they had been fighting half an hour, though from what Joe had told her she knew it had been only three minutes.With the crash of the gong Joe’s seconds were through the ropes and running him into his corner for the blessed minute of rest.One man, squatting on the floor between his outstretched feet and elevating them by resting them on his knees, was violently chafing his legs.Joe sat on the stool, leaning far back into the corner, head thrown back and arms outstretched on the ropes to give easy expansion to the chest.With wide-open mouth he was breathing the towel-driven air furnished by two of the seconds, while listening to the counsel of still another second who talked with low voice in his ear and at the same time sponged off his face, shoulders, and chest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当这一切都完成时（也就用了仅十几秒钟），锣声又响了起来。助手们拿着他们的随身用具快跑着翻过围绳，乔和庞塔朝着对方往拳台中央快步走去。吉纳维芙不知道一分钟可以如此之短。一时间，她觉得这次休息时间是已经被缩短了的。她有些怀疑，却不知道自己在怀疑什么。</td>
		<td class="en">Hardly had all this been accomplished (it had taken no more than several seconds), when the gong sounded, the seconds scuttled through the ropes with their paraphernalia, and Joe and Ponta were advancing against each other to the centre of the ring.Genevieve had no idea that a minute could be so short.For a moment she felt that this rest had been cut, and was suspicious of she knew not what.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >庞塔发出了猛攻，左右并举，向之前一样凶蛮。尽管乔挡下了拳头，但这股蛮力太猛烈了以致于他被击得向后退了几步。庞塔像老虎一样跃上前去，穷追猛打。为了保持平衡，乔便解除了防备，张开一只胳膊，把头从双肩的保护之间抬起。庞塔立刻追了上来，挥出一记重拳，打在来不及躲闪的乔那毫无防备的下巴上。他俯身向前躲闪，后脑勺刚好躲过庞塔的一记拳头。他刚一站直，庞塔的左拳就向他直直地打了过来，那力量能把他打退到围绳外面。而他再次以比庞塔快那么一丁点儿的速度低下头，向前闪过了攻击。庞塔的拳头擦到乔肩膀后面的斜面上，掠过并消失在空气里。庞塔直直地打出右拳又擦了过去，乔则俯身抱住庞塔，将双方拖入扭斗。</td>
		<td class="en">Ponta lashed out, right and left, savagely as ever, and though Joe blocked the blows, such was the force of them that he was knocked backward several steps.Ponta was after him with the spring of a tiger.In the involuntary effort to maintain equilibrium, Joe had uncovered himself, flinging one arm out and lifting his head from beneath the sheltering shoulders.So swiftly had Ponta followed him, that a terrible swinging blow was coming at his unguarded jaw.He ducked forward and down, Ponta’s fist just missing the back of his head.As he came back to the perpendicular, Ponta’s left fist drove at him in a straight punch that would have knocked him backward through the ropes.Again, and with a swiftness an inappreciable fraction of time quicker than Ponta’s, he ducked forward.Ponta’s fist grazed the backward slope of the shoulder, and glanced off into the air.Ponta’s right drove straight out, and the graze was repeated as Joe ducked into the safety of a clinch.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吉纳维芙松了一口气，紧张的身体放松下来，感到了一阵虚弱。人群里发出了狂热的欢呼声。西尔弗斯坦站了起来，手舞足蹈地叫喊着，情绪完全失控了。就连克劳森先生也激动地在他邻座耳边尽情地叫嚷着。</td>
		<td class="en">Genevieve sighed with relief, her tense body relaxing and a faintness coming over her.The crowd was cheering madly.Silverstein was on his feet, shouting, gesticulating, completely out of himself.And even Mr. Clausen was yelling his enthusiasm, at the top of his lungs, into the ear of his nearest neighbor.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >扭斗被裁判分开，比赛继续进行。乔阻挡着、后退着、绕着拳台滑行着，在暴风雨一般的猛烈攻击中躲避拳头，寻找生路。他自己很少出拳，因为庞塔眼神敏锐，能同时攻守。在对手巨大的力量下，乔没有机会反击。他寄希望于庞塔自己最终把力量耗光。</td>
		<td class="en">The clinch was broken and the fight went on.Joe blocked, and backed, and slid around the ring, avoiding blows and living somehow through the whirlwind onslaughts.Rarely did he strike blows himself, for Ponta had a quick eye and could defend as well as attack, while Joe had no chance against the other’s enormous vitality.His hope lay in that Ponta himself should ultimately consume his strength.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但吉纳维芙开始疑惑，为什么她的爱人不出手。她有些生气了。她想要看到他向这个曾如此迫害他的怪物进行复仇。正当她越来越不耐烦时，机会来了，乔向庞塔的嘴巴挥了一拳。这是惊人的一击。她看到庞塔的头猛地拉向后面，嘴唇上立刻染上了血迹。这一击以及观众中的呼喊声激怒了他。他像野人一样地冲来冲去。之前攻击时的愤怒都没法和他现在的盛怒相比。乔没有再次出击的机会了。他忙着应付这场自己刚刚触发的风暴，阻挡着、掩护着，躲避到扭斗所带来的暂时安全的状态里。</td>
		<td class="en">But Genevieve was beginning to wonder why her lover did not fight.She grew angry.She wanted to see him wreak vengeance on this beast that had persecuted him so.Even as she waxed impatient, the chance came, and Joe whipped his fist to Ponta’s mouth.It was a staggering blow.She saw Ponta’s head go back with a jerk and the quick dye of blood upon his lips.The blow, and the great shout from the audience, angered him.He rushed like a wild man.The fury of his previous assaults was as nothing compared with the fury of this one.And there was no more opportunity for another blow.Joe was too busy living through the storm he had already caused, blocking, covering up, and ducking into the safety and respite of the clinches.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但扭斗也不总是安全和解脱。每时每刻都要高度警觉，而两人分开的时候则更加危险。吉纳维芙已经注意到乔在和庞塔扭斗时身体那奇怪的蜷曲方式，她觉得有点好笑。在一次扭斗中，乔的蜷曲还没做好，庞塔的拳头就在空中从下而上直直地挥过来，只差毫厘就打到了乔的下巴，直到这时，她才明白了为什么乔要那样蜷曲着。当她已经能从容放心地看着他安全地蜷起来时，之后的又一次扭打中，庞塔的下巴高过乔的肩膀，他抬起右臂朝乔的腰背部重重地击下去。人群中发出忧虑的叹息声，而乔迅疾钳住对手的双臂，以防他再次挥拳。</td>
		<td class="en">But the clinch was not all safety and respite.Every instant of it was intense watchfulness, while the breakaway was still more dangerous.Genevieve had noticed, with a slight touch of amusement, the curious way in which Joe snuggled his body in against Ponta’s in the clinches; but she had not realized why, until, in one such clinch, before the snuggling in could be effected, Ponta’s fist whipped straight up in the air from under, and missed Joe’s chin by a hair’s-breadth.In another and later clinch, when she had already relaxed and sighed her relief at seeing him safely snuggled, Ponta, his chin over Joe’s shoulder, lifted his right arm and struck a terrible downward blow on the small of the back.The crowd groaned its apprehension, while Joe quickly locked his opponent’s arms to prevent a repetition of the blow.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >锣声响起，休息时间飞一样地过去，他们又开打了。——这次是在乔的场角，因为庞塔径直穿过拳击台，冲向了他。拳头落在了腰上，白色的皮肤就已变成了亮红色。吉纳维芙被那片飞溅的色彩和那只大手套吸引住了，也吓呆了，使得她几乎无法把目光从那儿移开。很快的，新一轮的扭打开始了，又是一击。但在那之后，乔总是能用手套下部抵住庞塔的嘴，这样就把他的头压在后面。这就防止了他的击打。但这一局结束前，庞塔至少有三次得手，每次都击中了同一个薄弱的部位。</td>
		<td class="en">The gong struck, and after the fleeting minute of rest, they went at it again—in Joe’s corner, for Ponta had made a rush to meet him clear across the ring.Where the blow had been over the kidneys, the white skin had become bright red.This splash of color, the size of the glove, fascinated and frightened Genevieve so that she could scarcely take her eyes from it.Promptly, in the next clinch, the blow was repeated; but after that Joe usually managed to give Ponta the heel of the glove on the mouth and so hold his head back.This prevented the striking of the blow; but three times more, before the round ended, Ponta effected the trick, each time striking the same vulnerable part.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >又一次休息过后，下一局比赛开始了。乔没有再受什么伤，庞塔的力量也没有减弱。而在第五轮开局，乔被困在角落，好像要俯身开始扭斗。就在这个动作未完之时，恰在那时，庞塔正准备用自己的身体去准备迎接乔的蜷曲，乔却微微后退，朝他对手那不设防的胃部发出一击。这些拳头像闪电一样，一共四击，左右开弓。这几拳重击让庞塔连连踉跄后退，胳膊半吊着，肩膀也耷拉下来，好像他的腰被分成两半，要瓦解了似的。乔敏锐的眼睛注意到了这个好开局，他直直地猛出一拳，打在庞塔嘴上，又紧接着朝他下巴甩出一记半摆半勾的拳头。这拳没中，而是打在了庞塔脸上，把他打得摇摇晃晃倒向一边。</td>
		<td class="en">Another rest and another round went by, with no further damage to Joe and no diminution of strength on the part of Ponta.But in the beginning of the fifth round, Joe, caught in a corner, made as though to duck into a clinch.Just before it was effected, and at the precise moment that Ponta was ready with his own body to receive the snuggling in of Joe’s body, Joe drew back slightly and drove with his fists at his opponent’s unprotected stomach.Lightning-like blows they were, four of them, right and left; and heavy they were, for Ponta winced away from them and staggered back, half dropping his arms, his shoulders drooping forward and in, as though he were about to double in at the waist and collapse.Joe’s quick eye saw the opening, and he smashed straight out upon Ponta’s mouth, following instantly with a half swing, half hook, for the jaw.It missed, striking the cheek instead, and sending Ponta staggering sideways.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >观众全都站了起来，他们都朝乔呼喊着。吉纳维芙能听到他们叫着，“他制住他了，他制住他了！”她觉得比赛似乎步入了尾声。和那些人一样，她也失控了；她温和纤弱的一面统统不见了；每次爱人打出毁灭性的一击都让她欣喜若狂。</td>
		<td class="en">The house was on its feet, shouting, to a man.Genevieve could hear men crying, “He’s got ’m, he’s got ’m!” and it seemed to her the beginning of the end.She, too, was out of herself; softness and tenderness had vanished; she exulted with each crushing blow her lover delivered.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但庞塔的生命力仍然出乎意料地强。之前，庞塔像猛虎一样穷追着乔打。现在是乔在穷追着他打。他又朝庞塔的下巴发出一记半摆半勾拳，而这时，彭塔已经恢复了力量和神智，闪得干净利落。乔的拳头扫过空气，这一击用力过猛，让乔踉跄着打了个侧半旋儿。接着，庞塔用左拳发出一记猛击。他的手套打在了乔没有防护的脖子上。吉纳维芙看到她爱人的胳膊随着身体的抬高而向后退去，然后四肢无力地倒在地板上。裁判朝他俯下身，开始数秒。他每数一秒都用右臂朝下挥一下，来强调时间的流逝。</td>
		<td class="en">But Ponta’s vitality was yet to be reckoned with.As, like a tiger, he had followed Joe up, Joe now followed him up.He made another half swing, half hook, for Ponta’s jaw, and Ponta, already recovering his wits and strength, ducked cleanly.Joe’s fist passed on through empty air, and so great was the momentum of the blow that it carried him around, in a half twirl, sideways.Then Ponta lashed out with his left.His glove landed on Joe’s unguarded neck.Genevieve saw her lover’s arms drop to his sides as his body lifted, went backward, and fell limply to the floor.The referee, bending over him, began to count the seconds, emphasizing the passage of each second with a downward sweep of his right arm.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >观众陷入了死一般的寂静。庞塔半转向观众，想要获得他应得的赞许，但迎来的却只是如同墓地一样的寂静。他心头窜起一阵怒火。这不公平。他的对手只是打出一拳或是躲过一拳都能迎来掌声；而他，庞塔，从开始就一直在主动出击，却没得到过任何欢呼。</td>
		<td class="en">The audience was still as death.Ponta had partly turned to the house to receive the approval that was his due, only to be met by this chill, graveyard silence.Quick wrath surged up in him.It was unfair.His opponent only was applauded—if he struck a blow, if he escaped a blow; he, Ponta, who had forced the fighting from the start, had received no word of cheer.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">His eyes blazed as he gathered himself together and sprang to his prostrate foe.He crouched alongside of him, right arm drawn back and ready for a smashing blow the instant Joe should start to rise.The referee, still bending over and counting with his right hand, shoved Ponta back with his left.The latter, crouching, circled around, and the referee circled with him, thrusting him back and keeping between him and the fallen man.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Four—five—six—” the count went on, and Joe, rolling over on his face, squirmed weakly to draw himself to his knees.This he succeeded in doing, resting on one knee, a hand to the floor on either side and the other leg bent under him to help him rise.“Take the count!Take the count!” a dozen voices rang out from the audience.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“看在上帝的份上，就认输吧！”乔的一个助手在场边大叫着警示他。吉纳维芙快速地瞥了他一眼，她看到那个年轻人脸色苍白、满是忧虑。他的嘴唇无意识地在颤抖着，他一直在跟着裁判数秒。</td>
		<td class="en">“For God’s sake, take the count!” one of Joe’s seconds cried warningly from the edge of the ring.Genevieve gave him one swift glance, and saw the young fellow’s face, drawn and white, his lips unconsciously moving as he kept the count with the referee.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The ninth sounded and was gone, when the referee gave Ponta a last backward shove and Joe came to his feet, bunched up, covered up, weak, but cool, very cool.Ponta hurled himself upon him with terrific force, delivering an uppercut and a straight punch.But Joe blocked the two, ducked a third, stepped to the side to avoid a fourth, and was then driven backward into a corner by a hurricane of blows.He was exceedingly weak.He tottered as he kept his footing, and staggered back and forth.His back was against the ropes.There was no further retreat.Ponta paused, as if to make doubly sure, then feinted with his left and struck fiercely with his right with all his strength.But Joe ducked into a clinch and was for a moment saved.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Ponta struggled frantically to free himself.He wanted to give the finish to this foe already so far gone.But Joe was holding on for life, resisting the other’s every effort, as fast as one hold or grip was torn loose finding a new one by which to cling.“Break!” the referee commanded.Joe held on tighter.“Make ’m break! Why the hell don’t you make ’m break?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >庞塔朝裁判气喘吁吁地说。裁判又一次命令他们分开。乔拒绝放手，坚持死死抱着庞塔。因为他完全明白，这是符合规则的。扭打的每一刻，乔的力量都在回升，头脑正变得清醒，眼前蜘蛛网一样模糊的一团也正在消失。这一轮才刚开始，然而，他必须设法挺过下面将近三分钟的时间。</td>
		<td class="en">Ponta panted at the referee.Again the latter commanded the break.Joe refused, keeping, as he well knew, within his rights.Each moment of the clinch his strength was coming back to him, his brain was clearing, the cobwebs were disappearing from before his eyes.The round was young, and he must live, somehow, through the nearly three minutes of it yet to run.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >裁判抓着他们二人的肩膀，用蛮力把他们分开，并在把两人分别向后推的时候快速从他们中间穿过，以便将他们彻底分开。获得自由的那一刻，庞塔向乔扑去，就像扑向猎物的野兽。但乔做好了掩护，挡回了攻击，并又开始了扭斗。庞塔再次努力地挣脱，乔坚持不放。裁判把他们分开。为了避免受伤，乔再次继续扭斗。</td>
		<td class="en">The referee clutched each by the shoulder and sundered them violently, passing quickly between them as he thrust them backward in order to make a clean break of it.The moment he was free, Ponta sprang at Joe like a wild animal bearing down its prey.But Joe covered up, blocked, and fell into a clinch.Again Ponta struggled to get free, Joe held on, and the referee thrust them apart.And again Joe avoided damage and clinched.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">In the stillness the sally was heard over the whole house, and the audience, relieved of its anxiety for its favorite, laughed with an uproariousness that had in it the note of hysteria.Even Genevieve felt that there was something irresistibly funny in the remark, and the relief of the audience was communicated to her; yet she felt sick and faint, and was overwrought with horror at what she had seen and was seeing.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这对庞塔的影响很坏。他变得比之前更加疯狂，也更无力了。他喘息着、抽泣着、事半功倍地挣扎着，失去了理智和自控力，试着用身体多余的蛮力来补偿损失，结果却徒劳。对于毁灭，他只知道盲目地去渴望它。像小狗对老鼠那样摇晃着扭斗中的乔，拉扯着、挣扎着，要把身体和手臂挣脱出来。而乔则始终死死地抱住他不放。裁判果断公平地将他们分开。汗水从他脸上滑落下来。他使出全力才把紧紧抱住的两个人分开，而每次他刚一把他们分开，乔就再次把庞塔抱住，他就又要重复一遍刚才的工作。庞塔在分开后试着躲过乔环抱上来的胳膊和缠绕的身体，却未能成功。他就是不能摆脱乔。他必须离乔足够近才能出拳，而每次乔都没让他得手，并用手臂钳住他。</td>
		<td class="en">The effect was bad on Ponta.He became more frenzied than ever, and more impotent.He panted and sobbed, wasting his effort by too much effort, losing sanity and control and futilely trying to compensate for the loss by excess of physical endeavor.He knew only the blind desire to destroy, shook Joe in the clinches as a terrier might a rat, strained and struggled for freedom of body and arms, and all the while Joe calmly clutched and held on.The referee worked manfully and fairly to separate them.Perspiration ran down his face.It took all his strength to split those clinging bodies, and no sooner had he split them than Joe fell unharmed into another embrace and the work had to be done all over again.In vain, when freed, did Ponta try to avoid the clutching arms and twining body.He could not keep away.He had to come close in order to strike, and each time Joe baffled him and caught him in his arms.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">And Genevieve, crouched in the little dressing-room and peering through the peep-hole, was baffled, too.She was an interested party in what seemed a death-struggle—was not one of the fighters her Joe?—but the audience understood and she did not.The Game had not unveiled to her.The lure of it was beyond her.It was greater mystery than ever.She could not comprehend its power.What delight could there be for Joe in that brutal surging and straining of bodies, those fierce clutches, fiercer blows, and terrible hurts?Surely, she, Genevieve, offered more than that—rest, and content, and sweet, calm joy.Her bid for the heart of him and the soul of him was finer and more generous than the bid of the Game; yet he dallied with both—held her in his arms, but turned his head to listen to that other and siren call she could not understand.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >打斗又回到了最初的样子——乔防守，庞塔猛攻。但庞塔从未放松过。比赛不是按照他的方式进行下去的。从前的每一场比赛里，在他凶猛的攻势中，对手往往都会猛烈地反击。乔则保存着自己的体力。庞塔每出十拳，他才出一拳，但他这一拳很少打空。庞塔的攻势把乔淹没了，但却拿他无可奈何。而乔随时可能打出猛虎般的一击让他不得不保持警觉。它们消磨着庞塔的凶猛之势。他已经不能像先前那样恣意发出毁灭性的攻击了。</td>
		<td class="en">The fight was as it had been at the beginning—Joe protecting, Ponta rushing.But Ponta was never at ease.He did not have it all his own way.At any moment, in his fiercest onslaughts, his opponent was liable to lash out and reach him.Joe saved his strength.He struck one blow to Ponta’s ten, but his one blow rarely missed.Ponta overwhelmed him in the attacks, yet could do nothing with him, while Joe’s tiger-like strokes, always imminent, compelled respect.They toned Ponta’s ferocity.He was no longer able to go in with the complete abandon of destructiveness which had marked his earlier efforts.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而局势正在发生变化。观众很快就注意到了这点，就连吉纳维夫都在第九局开始的时候看了出来。乔开始主动攻击。扭抱中，是他在向对手的腰背上挥拳，狠狠地把拳打在腰间。每次扭抱中，他都打出这样一拳，但这一拳凝结了他的所有力量，每次都不例外。然后，二人分开的时候，他开始用上勾拳袭击庞塔的胃部，或是钩住他的下巴，或是发出直拳打在他的嘴上。但一看见庞塔刚要开始他那旋风般的攻击时，乔就会敏捷地跳开，开始防守。</td>
		<td class="en">But a change was coming over the fight.The audience was quick to note it, and even Genevieve saw it by the beginning of the ninth round.Joe was taking the offensive.In the clinches it was he who brought his fist down on the small of the back, striking the terrible kidney blow.He did it once, in each clinch, but with all his strength, and he did it every clinch.Then, in the breakaways, he began to uppercut Ponta on the stomach, or to hook his jaw or strike straight out upon the mouth.But at first sign of a coming of a whirlwind, Joe would dance nimbly away and cover up.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如此这样过了两局、三局。尽管庞塔的力气明显小了，但并没有很快消失。乔的任务就是要把他的力量消耗殆尽，不是用一拳或是十拳，而是不停地一拳接着一拳，直到那股巨大的力量完全在他身体中耗尽。他没有一点儿喘息的时间。乔向他步步紧逼，向前迈出的左脚踏在硬帆布上，发出哒哒声。紧跟着就是一次猛虎般地突然跳袭，一拳或是几拳，然后再迅速跳回，于是左脚便可再次抬起，向前迈去。庞塔发出猛攻时，乔就小心地掩护着，只是在迅速采取进一步行动时，左脚才哒哒哒地踏着。</td>
		<td class="en">Two rounds of this went by, and three, but Ponta’s strength, though perceptibly less, did not diminish rapidly.Joe’s task was to wear down that strength, not with one blow, nor ten, but with blow after blow, without end, until that enormous strength should be beaten sheer out of its body.There was no rest for the man.Joe followed him up, step by step, his advancing left foot making an audible tap, tap, tap, on the hard canvas.Then there would come a sudden leap in, tiger-like, a blow struck, or blows, and a swift leap back, whereupon the left foot would take up again its tapping advance.When Ponta made his savage rushes, Joe carefully covered up, only to emerge, his left foot going tap, tap, tap, as he immediately followed up.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吉纳维芙曾在早上的百货商店里想象和猜测过乔会有一张杀气腾腾的脸，但在之前的所有回合里，她都未曾见到过。有时，他的脸实在很孩子气；在承受着最猛烈的攻击时，他的脸色则是灰白色的；而当他渡过了难关、死死抓住庞塔继续扭抱时，脸上呈现出一种渴望的表情。但现在他已经脱离了危险，主动攻击，他的脸上开始出现杀气。她看了之后一阵战栗。这种表情让他离她如此之远。她原以为她了解他的全部，以为他在她的掌心里；但她并不知道乔的这一面——这张钢铁一般的脸、铁石心肠的嘴和那寒光闪烁的双眼。在她看来，那是复仇天使冷静的脸，上面只印着上帝的旨意。</td>
		<td class="en">In all the previous rounds Genevieve had not seen Joe’s fighting face which had been prefigured to her that morning in the department store.Sometimes his face had been quite boyish; other times, when taking his fiercest punishment, it had been bleak and gray; and still later, when living through and clutching and holding on, it had taken on a wistful expression.But now, out of danger himself and as he forced the fight, his fighting face came upon him.She saw it and shuddered.It removed him so far from her.She had thought she knew him, all of him, and held him in the hollow of her hand; but this she did not know—this face of steel, this mouth of steel, these eyes of steel flashing the light and glitter of steel.It seemed to her the passionless face of an avenging angel, stamped only with the purpose of the Lord.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >庞塔试图使出他的老招数，但乔朝他嘴上打了一拳，止住了这次攻击。乔没有让他喘息，而是一刻不停、毫不宽容甚至是威胁般地继续进攻。这是第十三局，以在庞塔场角的一阵猛击中结束。庞塔试图重整旗鼓。他跪了下来，直到裁判倒数到九秒才起身，然后又想通过扭抱获得安全，但却未能躲过乔在他胃部打下的四记猛拳。在锣声中，他喘着粗气地后退着，倒在他助手们的胳膊里。</td>
		<td class="en">Ponta attempted one of his old-time rushes, but was stopped on the mouth.Implacable, insistent, ever menacing, never letting him rest, Joe followed him up.The round, the thirteenth, closed with a rush, in Ponta’s corner.He attempted a rally, was brought to his knees, took the nine seconds’ count, and then tried to clinch into safety, only to receive four of Joe’s terrible stomach punches, so that with the gong he fell back, gasping, into the arms of his seconds.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >乔身体前倾，双脚夹在一起，准备一跃而起，像个等待发令枪响的短跑运动员。他在等待着锣声。锣声刚一响起，他就飞快地站了起来，穿过拳击台，从助手中间揪住了刚从凳子上站起来的庞塔。他被乔的一记右拳打倒，跌在了他助手们的中间。正当他刚从水桶、板凳和助手们的一片混乱中站起来时，乔又一次将他打倒。之后，还没走出自己的场角时，他又第三次地被乔击倒了。</td>
		<td class="en">Joe leaned forward, feet gathered under him for a spring, like a foot-racer waiting the start.He was waiting for the gong.When it sounded he shot forward and across the ring, catching Ponta in the midst of his seconds as he rose from his stool.And in the midst of his seconds he went down, knocked down by a right-hand blow.As he arose from the confusion of buckets, stools, and seconds, Joe put him down again.And yet a third time he went down before he could escape from his own corner.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >终于，乔开始了旋风一般的攻击。吉纳维芙想起了乔说的“只管看着吧，到我追着他打的时候你会懂的。”观众们也懂了。他们都站了起来，提高嗓门，尖声叫喊着。那是人群血脉喷张的叫喊，在她听来就像是想象中狼嚎的声音一样。她在感到爱人胜券在握的同时，心里也开始有点儿同情庞塔。</td>
		<td class="en">Joe had at last become the whirlwind.Genevieve remembered his “just watch, you’ll know when I go after him.”The house knew it, too.It was on its feet, every voice raised in a fierce yell.It was the blood-cry of the crowd, and it sounded to her like what she imagined must be the howling of wolves.And what with confidence in her lover’s victory she found room in her heart to pity Ponta.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他努力防守、阻挡、掩护、躲避，通过扭抱获取片刻的安全，然而这一切都是徒劳的。他连片刻的喘息时间都没有。他的命运就是一次又一次地被击倒。他被打得时而往后，时而从侧面倒向帆布，在扭抱和分开时也在挨拳头——摇晃着的坚硬的拳头令他头晕目眩，肌肉中的力量也在流失。他又被打到了角落，触到围绳而弹了回来，紧接着的又一击让他再次倒在围绳上。他在空气中挥动着胳膊，打出的空拳里含着野性的气息。他身上已经没有什么人性了。他是野兽的化身，狂怒地咆哮着走向毁灭。他被打得跪了下来，但却拒绝裁判数秒，刚踉踉跄跄站起来，嘴上立刻又挨了强硬的一拳，身子甩回到了围绳上。</td>
		<td class="en">In vain he struggled to defend himself, to block, to cover up, to duck, to clinch into a moment’s safety.That moment was denied him.Knockdown after knockdown was his portion.He was knocked to the canvas backwards, and sideways, was punched in the clinches and in the breakaways—stiff, jolty blows that dazed his brain and drove the strength from his muscles.He was knocked into the corners and out again, against the ropes, rebounding, and with another blow against the ropes once more.He fanned the air with his arms, showering savage blows upon emptiness.There was nothing human left in him.He was the beast incarnate, roaring and raging and being destroyed.He was smashed down to his knees, but refused to take the count, staggering to his feet only to be met stiff-handed on the mouth and sent hurling back against the ropes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他苦苦挣扎着、喘息着、打着转儿，气喘吁吁、目光呆滞地抽泣着。样子古怪中带着几分英勇，好像要战斗到最后一秒，努力地去够着他的对手。他被追得绕着拳台跑得摇摇晃晃。而就在那时，乔的脚在湿了的帆布上滑了一下。庞塔那双发晕的眼睛捕捉到了这个瞬间，他知道机会来了。他身体中正在消散的所有力量都集聚起来，为了打出那闪电一样的最后侥幸的一击。正当乔滑倒的时候，他狠狠地打出一拳，正中下巴。乔向后倒去。吉纳维芙看到他飞起在空中时肌肉都松弛了，她听到他的头重重地落在帆布上的声音。</td>
		<td class="en">In sore travail, gasping, reeling, panting, with glazing eyes and sobbing breath, grotesque and heroic, fighting to the last, striving to get at his antagonist, he surged and was driven about the ring.And in that moment Joe’s foot slipped on the wet canvas.Ponta’s swimming eyes saw and knew the chance.All the fleeing strength of his body gathered itself together for the lightning lucky punch.Even as Joe slipped the other smote him, fairly on the point of the chin.He went over backward.Genevieve saw his muscles relax while he was yet in the air, and she heard the thud of his head on the canvas.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >喧闹的观众立刻静了下来。裁判朝着乔不再动弹的身躯弯下腰来，开始数秒。庞塔踉踉跄跄地跪下了。他挣扎着前后摇摆地站了起来，一边试着用那带着恨意的双眼扫视观众。他的双腿颤抖着弯了下来；他呛着、抽泣着、费力地呼吸着。他跌跌撞撞地向后退去，伸手胡乱抓住了围绳，才免于摔倒。他倚在那儿，低垂着、弯着腰、整个身体都屈服了，头垂在胸前，直到裁判数到那决定性的第十秒并朝他指着他已经赢得的奖牌。</td>
		<td class="en">The noise of the yelling house died suddenly.The referee, stooping over the inert body, was counting the seconds.Ponta tottered and fell to his knees.He struggled to his feet, swaying back and forth as he tried to sweep the audience with his hatred.His legs were trembling and bending under him; he was choking and sobbing, fighting to breathe.He reeled backward, and saved himself from falling by a blind clutching for the ropes.He clung there, drooping and bending and giving in all his body, his head upon his chest, until the referee counted the fatal tenth second and pointed to him in token that he had won.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >没人为他鼓掌。他扭动着身体穿过围绳，像蛇一样地滑入助手的手臂中。他们帮他站到地板上，扶着他穿过走道，来到人群中间。乔还躺在他之前摔倒的地方。他的助手们把他抬到他的场角，将他放在凳子上。人们开始朝拳台上爬，急切地想看看怎么样了。但警察已经来了，他们粗暴地将观众都推到了外面。</td>
		<td class="en">He received no applause, and he squirmed through the ropes, snakelike, into the arms of his seconds, who helped him to the floor and supported him down the aisle into the crowd.Joe remained where he had fallen.His seconds carried him into his corner and placed him on the stool.Men began climbing into the ring, curious to see, but were roughly shoved out by the policemen, who were already there.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吉纳维芙继续从窥孔里看着。她并没有感到特别地心烦意乱。她的爱人已经被打败了。到目前为止，她与他在失落方面是有认同感的，但除此之外，她没有别的感觉了。她甚至在某种程度上有点儿开心。拳赛欺骗了他，那么她就更有可能得到他。她也曾听他说过被人打败的经历。人总是需要一些时间才能从这些影响中缓过来。直到听见助手们在找大夫，她才真正地感到担心。</td>
		<td class="en">Genevieve looked on from her peep-hole.She was not greatly perturbed.Her lover had been knocked out.In so far as disappointment was his, she shared it with him; but that was all.She even felt glad in a way.The Game had played him false, and he was more surely hers.She had heard of knockouts from him.It often took men some time to recover from the effects.It was not till she heard the seconds asking for the doctor that she felt really worried.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们把他无力的身体拖到围绳外面的台阶上，消失在她从窥孔看去的视野中。接着，更衣室的门被撞开，一群男人进来了。他们抬着乔。他被放在落满灰尘的地上，头靠在一个助手的膝盖上。似乎没人对她的存在感到惊讶。她过去在他身边跪下来。他闭着眼，嘴唇微张。湿漉漉的头发一绺一绺紧紧地粘着，直直地搭在脸上。她举起他的一只手。那只手很重，一点儿生气也没有，她被吓到了。她突然看了看那些助手和她身边人们的脸，以及她身边这个男人的脸。他们看上去都被吓住了，除了其中一个，他低声地诅咒着，叫人害怕。她抬起头，看到西尔弗斯坦就站在她身边。看上去也被吓住了。他体贴地把手放在她肩上，手指用力按了按，表示同情。</td>
		<td class="en">They passed his limp body through the ropes to the stage, and it disappeared beyond the limits of her peep-hole.Then the door of her dressing-room was thrust open and a number of men came in.They were carrying Joe.He was laid down on the dusty floor, his head resting on the knee of one of the seconds.No one seemed surprised by her presence.She came over and knelt beside him.His eyes were closed, his lips slightly parted.His wet hair was plastered in straight locks about his face.She lifted one of his hands.It was very heavy, and the lifelessness of it shocked her.She looked suddenly at the faces of the seconds and of the men about her.They seemed frightened, all save one, and he was cursing, in a low voice, horribly.She looked up and saw Silverstein standing beside her.He, too, seemed frightened.He rested a kindly hand on her shoulder, tightening the fingers with a sympathetic pressure.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这同情让她感到害怕。她开始感到晕眩。有人进了房间，引起了一阵喧嚷。那人走上前来，暴躁地宣布：“出去！出去！你们得把房间清理干净！”</td>

		<td class="en">“That’s all right, she’s his girl,” spoke up a young fellow she recognized as her guide.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你呢？”大夫又突然暴躁地朝西尔弗斯坦发问。</td>
		<td class="en">“And you?” the other man blurted explosively at Silverstein.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我和她是一起的。”他挑衅地问答道。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >大夫嘟哝了一下，然后跪了下来。他把手放在乔湿湿的头上，又嘟囔了一下，接着把手移到他腿上。</td>
		<td class="en">The newcomer grunted and knelt down.He passed a hand over the damp head, grunted again, and arose to his feet.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这我治不了，”他说，“叫救护车来吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“This is no case for me,” he said.“Send for the ambulance.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >后来发生的事对吉纳维芙来说就像一场梦。也许她晕倒了，她不知道，但还能有什么别的原因让西尔弗斯坦搂着她、架着她呢？所有人的脸庞似乎都变得模糊而虚幻了。她听见各种支离破碎的讨论声。那个之前当她向导的年轻人在说着有关记者的事。“你的名字会上报纸的。”她能听见西尔弗斯坦对她说。那声音好像从很远的地方传来。她知道自己正抵触地摇着头。</td>
		<td class="en">Then the thing became a dream to Genevieve.Maybe she had fainted, she did not know, but for what other reason should Silverstein have his arm around her supporting her?All the faces seemed blurred and unreal.Fragments of a discussion came to her ears.The young fellow who had been her guide was saying something about reporters.“You vill get your name in der papers,” she could hear Silverstein saying to her, as from a great distance; and she knew she was shaking her head in refusal.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >突然又冒出了一批新的面孔，她看见乔被人用一个帆布担架抬走了。西尔弗斯坦正把长大衣扣子扣起来，用领子围住她的脸。她感到夜风吹在脸上，抬头便看见清冷的星星。她挤进一个座位。西尔弗斯坦在她旁边。乔也在那儿，还在担架上躺着，赤裸的身上盖着些毯子；一个穿着蓝色制服的男人亲切地跟她说着话，虽然她不知道他在说些什么。马蹄嗒嗒地响，她正在黑夜中颠簸穿行去往某个地方。</td>
		<td class="en">There was an eruption of new faces, and she saw Joe carried out on a canvas stretcher.Silverstein was buttoning the long overcoat and drawing the collar about her face.She felt the night air on her cheek, and looking up saw the clear, cold stars.She jammed into a seat.Silverstein was beside her.Joe was there, too, still on his stretcher, with blankets over his naked body; and there was a man in blue uniform who spoke kindly to her, though she did not know what he said.Horses’ hoofs were clattering, and she was lurching somewhere through the night.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接着，就是灯光、声响，还有碘酒的味道。这一定就是收容医院吧，她想，这是手术台，那些是医生。他们在给乔作检查。他们中的一个人长得像外国人，眼睛和胡子都是深色的。他朝桌子俯下的身体直了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">Next, light and voices, and a smell of iodoform.This must be the receiving hospital, she thought, this the operating table, those the doctors.They were examining Joe.One of them, a dark-eyed, dark-bearded, foreign-looking man, rose up from bending over the table.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“从没见过像这样的，”他正对另一个人说，“整个后脑壳。”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她嘴唇滚烫干燥，喉咙疼痛难忍。但她为什么没有哭？她应该哭，她觉得自己有这个责任。那是洛蒂（在梦里又换了个场景），站在狭窄小帆布床的另一边，她在哭。有人在说着有关死亡昏迷的事。不是那个长得像外国人的大夫，而是别人。是谁已经不重要了。现在几点了？她看到天亮前微微的白色晨曦落在窗户上，好像在作答。</td>
		<td class="en">Her lips were hot and dry, and there was an intolerable ache in her throat.But why didn’t she cry?She ought to cry; she felt it incumbent upon her.There was Lottie (there had been another change in the dream), across the little narrow cot from her, and she was crying.Somebody was saying something about the coma of death.It was not the foreign-looking doctor, but somebody else.It did not matter who it was.What time was it?As if in answer, she saw the faint white light of dawn on the windows.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这，便是一切的终点——那些地毯、家具和那租来的小房子，那些见面和散步，那些令人悸动的满是星光的夜晚，那甜蜜的投降，那些爱与被爱。她被拳赛这她并不能了解的可怕事实惊呆了——它对男人心灵的控制，它的讽刺性和不可信赖性，它的风险和危险，以及血脉凶蛮地喷张，令女人感到同情。它不是男人的一切，也不是他们的终结，而是他的玩具和消遣；他给了他的女人百般温柔呵护，他的情绪和重要时刻，而将他日日夜夜的奋斗，他对自己头脑和身体的敬意，他最耐心的忍耐和最狂野的攻击，他所有的张力——都给了拳赛，他心之所向。</td>
		<td class="en">This, then, was the end of it all—of the carpets, and furniture, and the little rented house; of the meetings and walking out, the thrilling nights of starshine, the deliciousness of surrender, the loving and the being loved.She was stunned by the awful facts of this Game she did not understand—the grip it laid on men’s souls, its irony and faithlessness, its risks and hazards and fierce insurgences of the blood, making woman pitiful, not the be-all and end-all of man, but his toy and his pastime; to woman his mothering and caretaking, his moods and his moments, but to the Game his days and nights of striving, the tribute of his head and hand, his most patient toil and wildest effort, all the strain and the stress of his being—to the Game, his heart’s desire.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Genevieve stooped obediently over the quiet clay and pressed her lips to the lips yet warm.The door opened and she passed into another room.There stood Mrs. Silverstein, with angry eyes that snapped vindictively at sight of her boy’s clothes.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">But a flood of tears welled into her eyes and voice, and with her fat arms outstretched, ungainly, ludicrous, holy with motherhood, she tottered over to the quiet girl and folded her to her breast.She muttered gasping, inarticulate love-words, rocking slowly to and fro the while, and patting Genevieve’s shoulder with her ponderous hand.</td></tr>
