		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >售票处的售票员说：“再买一份意外保险吧？”“不用了，”我想了一下说，“不用了，我相信不会有事故的。今天我一整天都会坐火车旅行。不过，明天我就不旅行了。给我一份明天的意外保险吧。”那个售票员看起来很困惑。他说：“但这是意外事故的保险，而且要是你坐火车旅行的话——”“要是我坐火车旅行，我就不需要保险了。在家躺在床上才是让我害怕的事情。”我一直在研究这件事情。去年，我旅行了20,000英里，几乎都是坐火车；前年，我旅行了25,000多英里，一半路程坐轮船，一半路程坐火车；大前年，我在周边旅行了大约10,000英里，都是坐火车。我想，如果我把这些零碎的小旅程加起来的话，可以说，在刚刚提到的三年中我已经旅行了60,000英里。而且从没发生过事故。</td>
		<td class="en">The man in the ticket-office said:“Have an accident insurance ticket, also?”“No,” I said, after studying the matter over a little.“No, I believe not; I am going to be traveling by rail all day today.However, tomorrow I don’t travel.Give me one for tomorrow.”The man looked puzzled.He said: “But it is for accident insurance, and if you are going to travel by rail—”“If I am going to travel by rail I sha’n’t need it.Lying at home in bed is the thing I am afraid of.”I had been looking into this matter.Last year I traveled twenty thousand miles, almost entirely by rail; the year before, I traveled over twenty-five thousand miles, half by sea and half by rail; and the year before that I traveled in the neighborhood of ten thousand miles, exclusively by rail.I suppose if I put in all the little odd journeys here and there, I may say I have traveled sixty thousand miles during the three years I have mentioned.AND NEVER AN ACCIDENT.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >每天早晨，我都自言自语好一会儿：“到目前为止，我都没有碰到过意外事故，那我这次遇到事故的可能性就会大大增加。我要精明些，买份意外保险。”无疑我抽到了空签，那晚睡觉时我的关节没有松动，也没有骨裂。我已经厌倦了每天都要买一次，于是开始买月意外险。我对自己说：“一个人不可能一次买的30张都是空签吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">For a good while I said to myself every morning: “Now I have escaped thus far, and so the chances are just that much increased that I shall catch it this time.I will be shrewd, and buy an accident ticket.”And to a dead moral certainty I drew a blank, and went to bed that night without a joint started or a bone splintered.I got tired of that sort of daily bother, and fell to buying accident tickets that were good for a month.I said to myself, “A man CAN’T buy thirty blanks in one bundle.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是我错了。签里从来不会有奖品。每天我都会读到一些铁路事故——报纸上充斥着这些，但不知为什么，我从没遇到过。我发现我自己在意外事故上已经花了许多钱，但却一无所获。我起了疑心，并开始寻找得到过意外保险赔偿的人。我找了许多买过保险的人，但没有一个人遇到过事故或得到过赔偿。我不再买意外保险并开始统计。结果令人震惊。危险并不在旅行中，而是在家里。</td>
		<td class="en">But I was mistaken.There was never a prize in the lot.I could read of railway accidents every day—the newspaper atmosphere was foggy with them; but somehow they never came my way.I found I had spent a good deal of money in the accident business, and had nothing to show for it.My suspicions were aroused, and I began to hunt around for somebody that had won in this lottery.I found plenty of people who had invested, but not an individual that had ever had an accident or made a cent.I stopped buying accident tickets and went to ciphering.The result was astounding.THE PERIL LAY NOT IN TRAVELING, BUT IN STAYING AT HOME.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我找到了统计数据，并且惊讶地发现尽管报纸上关于铁路事故的标题引人注目，但在过去12个月里真正因为这些事故丧生的还不到300人。名单上，伊利路被看做“最凶残”的路。它令46人——或是26人丧生，我记不太清了，但我知道这个数字是其他公路死亡人数的两倍。但事实立刻告诉我们，伊利路非常长，而且这条路上的生意往来也比国内其他路上的要多，因此这个双倍的死亡数字就不足为奇了。进一步计算表明仅纽约和罗切斯特之间的伊利路上每天就有八趟单向载客火车——两个方向一共16趟，每日平均载客量有6000人。也就是，六个月中大概有100万的载客量——相当于纽约市的人口数量。那么，六个月内伊利路杀死了这100万人中的13到23个人。而在相同的时间内，纽约市的100万人中就有13,000人死在床上。我浑身颤抖，头发也倒竖起来。“这太令人震惊了！”我说道。“坐火车旅行并不危险，信赖那些致命的床才危险。我再也不在床上睡觉了。”</td>
		<td class="en">I hunted up statistics, and was amazed to find that after all the glaring newspaper headlines concerning railroad disasters, less than THREE HUNDRED people had really lost their lives by those disasters in the preceding twelve months.The Erie road was set down as the most murderous in the list.It had killed forty-six— or twenty-six, I do not exactly remember which, but I know the number was double that of any other road.But the fact straightway suggested itself that the Erie was an immensely long road, and did more business than any other line in the country; so the double number of killed ceased to be matter for surprise.By further figuring, it appeared that between New York and Rochester the Erie ran eight passenger-trains each way every day—16 altogether; and carried a daily average of 6,000 persons.That is about a million in six months—the population of New York City.Well, the Erie kills from 13 to 23 persons of ITS million in six months; and in the same time 13,000 of New York’s million die in their beds!My flesh crept, my hair stood on end.“This is appalling!”I said.“The danger isn’t in traveling by rail, but in trusting to those deadly beds.I will never sleep in a bed again.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我推算的数字还远远少于伊利路一半的载客量。显然，伊利路每天肯定运送至少11,000到12,000人。从波士顿延伸出许多短途公路，载客量足足是这个数的一半。这样的路有很多。这个合众国的领土上散布着许多公路，它们的载客量也大得惊人。因此，假设这个国家的每条铁路日均载客量是2500人是基本正确的。我们国家有846条铁路线，846条乘以2500人就是2,115,000人次。因此美国铁路的日载客量达200多万人，一年就是650,000,000人次，这还没有算上星期天呢。他们也进行过计算——这是毫无疑问的，但他们获得的原始数据显然在我计算的权限之外。因为我仔细查看了人口普查，发现美国并没有那么多人，但最少也有610,000,000人。他们肯定是把同一个人算了又算，这是很有可能的。</td>
		<td class="en">I had figured on considerably less than one-half the length of the Erie road.It was plain that the entire road must transport at least eleven or twelve thousand people every day.There are many short roads running out of Boston that do fully half as much; a great many such roads.There are many roads scattered about the Union that do a prodigious passenger business.Therefore it was fair to presume that an average of 2,500 passengers a day for each road in the country would be almost correct.There are 846 railway lines in our country, and 846 times 2,500 are 2,115,000.So the railways of America move more than two millions of people every day; six hundred and fifty millions of people a year, without counting the Sundays.They do that, too—there is no question about it; though where they get the raw material is clear beyond the jurisdiction of my arithmetic; for I have hunted the census through and through, and I find that there are not that many people in the United States, by a matter of six hundred and ten millions at the very least.They must use some of the same people over again, likely.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >旧金山的人口是纽约的1/8，前者每周的死亡人数是60，后者是500——如果他们走运的话。这就是说，旧金山每年有3120人死去，而纽约的死亡人数是它的八倍——也就是大约25,000或者26,000。两地人口的健康状况是一样的。因此，我们假设这是个适用于整个国家的正确推测，那么，每年每100万人中就有25,000人必须死去。这相当于整个人口的1/40。那么，我们中每年会有一百万人死去。在这一百万人中有11,000到12,000人是被刺死、射死、淹死、吊死、毒死的，或是以其他常见的暴毙方式死亡，例如煤油灯打翻引起衬裙着火，被埋在煤矿中，从房顶摔下来，掉下教堂或讲堂塌陷的地板，服用专利药品或以其他方式自杀。伊利铁路杀死了23到46个人，其余的845条铁路平均每三条路会杀死一个人，而这一百万人中剩下的是在床上自然死去的，共有987,631人，多么惊人的数字！</td>
		<td class="en">San Francisco is one-eighth as populous as New York; there are 60 deaths a week in the former and 500 a week in the latter—if they have luck.That is 3,120 deaths a year in San Francisco, and eight times as many in New York—say about 25,000 or 26,000.The health of the two places is the same.So we will let it stand as a fair presumption that this will hold good all over the country, and that consequently 25,000 out of every million of people we have must die every year.That amounts to one-fortieth of our total population.One million of us, then, die annually.Out of this million ten or twelve thousand are stabbed, shot, drowned, hanged, poisoned, or meet a similarly violent death in some other popular way, such as perishing by kerosene-lamp and hoop-skirt conflagrations, getting buried in coal-mines, falling off house-tops, breaking through church, or lecture-room floors, taking patent medicines, or committing suicide in other forms.The Erie railroad kills 23 to 46; the other 845 railroads kill an average of one-third of a man each; and the rest of that million, amounting in the aggregate to that appalling figure of 987,631 corpses, die naturally in their beds!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这下你们可以谅解我为什么要在床上寻找机会了吧。那些铁路对我太好了。</td>
		<td class="en">You will excuse me from taking any more chances on those beds.The railroads are good enough for me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我对所有人的建议是，能不呆在家里，就尽量不要呆在家里。但是当你不得不在家里呆一会儿的时候，就去买一堆的意外保险，还要彻夜不眠。再怎么小心都不为过。</td>
		<td class="en">And my advice to all people is, Don’t stay at home any more than you can help; but when you have GOT to stay at home a while, buy a package of those insurance tickets and sit up nights.You cannot be too cautious.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >（现在大家能明白为什么我在文章开头那样回答售票员了吧。）</td>
		<td class="en">(One can see now why I answered that ticket-agent in the manner recorded at the top of this sketch.)</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这篇文章的启示就是，轻率的人对美国铁路的管理抱怨得太过分了。当我们想到每年的日日夜夜，足足14,000辆各式各样的火车，运载着生生死死，轰隆隆地驶过这片土地时，奇迹并不是在12个月内，它们使300个人丧生，而是它们没有使300乘以300个人丧生！</td>
		<td class="en">The moral of this composition is, that thoughtless people grumble more than is fair about railroad management in the United States.When we consider that every day and night of the year full fourteen thousand railway-trains of various kinds, freighted with life and armed with death, go thundering over the land, the marvel is, NOT that they kill three hundred human beings in a twelvemonth, but that they do not kill three hundred times three hundred!</td></tr>
