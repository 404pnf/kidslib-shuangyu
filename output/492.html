		<td class="en">No one was allowed to come near him whose nose did not more or less resemble his own, and the courtiers, to get into favor with the Queen, took to pulling their babies’ noses several times every day to make them grow long.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，不论他们怎么做，他们的孩子也长不出王子那样的长鼻子。</td>
		<td class="en">But, do what they would, they were nothing by comparison with the Prince’s.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >王子懂事后就开始学习历史。只要谈到伟大的王子或者美丽的公主，他的老师都会特意告诉他：他们都长着长鼻子。</td>
		<td class="en">When he grew sensible he learned history; and whenever any great prince or beautiful princess was spoken of, his teachers took care to tell him that they had long noses.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他房间挂的所有画都画着长着大鼻子的人。因此，王子长这么大一直深信长鼻子是最美的，他不会因为任何原因让自己的鼻子变短，哪怕仅仅是一英寸。</td>
		<td class="en">His room was hung with pictures, all of people with very large noses; and the Prince grew up so convinced that a long nose was a great beauty, that he would not on any account have had his own a single inch shorter!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当他过了二十岁，王后觉得王子应该结婚了，于是她就命令把几位公主的画像拿来给王子看，这里面就有一幅可爱小公主的画像。</td>
		<td class="en">When his twentieth birthday was passed the Queen thought it was time that he should be married, so she commanded that the portraits of several princesses should be brought for him to see, and among the others was a picture of the Dear Little Princess!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她是一位伟大国王的女儿，将来会统治好几个国家。但是海辛斯王子已经没有心思想这些了，因为他已经被公主的美貌深深迷住了。</td>
		<td class="en">Now, she was the daughter of a great king, and would some day possess several kingdoms herself; but Prince Hyacinth had not a thought to spare for anything of that sort, he was so much struck with her beauty.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是令王子如此着迷的这位公主却长着一个俊俏的小鼻子，这可能是她脸上最漂亮的地方。侍臣们已经养成了一种习惯，时常想也不想就嘲笑起公主的小鼻子，这可让他们烦恼了一阵。他们可不敢当着王子的面这么做，因为王子可不觉得这有什么好笑的。实际上，王子还放逐了对可爱小公主小巧鼻子出言不逊的两位大臣。</td>
		<td class="en">The Princess, whom he thought quite charming, had, however, a little saucy nose, which, in her face, was the prettiest thing possible, but it was a cause of great embarrassment to the courtiers, who had got into such a habit of laughing at little noses that they sometimes found themselves laughing at hers before they had time to think; but this did not do at all before the Prince, who quite failed to see the joke, and actually banished two of his courtiers who had dared to mention disrespectfully the Dear Little Princess’s tiny nose!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >受到了这样的警告，其他的大臣都学会了想好了再开口。有位大臣甚至告诉王子，虽然一个男人没有大鼻子就一无是处，但是女人的美是不同的。他就认识一位了解古希腊历史的博学之士，他在一些古老的手抄本里读到过：美丽的克里奥佩特拉本人也有一个向上翘的小鼻子。</td>
		<td class="en">The others, taking warning from this, learned to think twice before they spoke, and one even went so far as to tell the Prince that, though it was quite true that no man could be worth anything unless he had a long nose, still, a woman’s beauty was a different thing; and he knew a learned man who understood Greek and had read in some old manuscripts that the beautiful Cleopatra herself had a “tip-tilted” nose!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >王子为此重重奖赏了这位大臣，并立刻派使者去向可爱小公主求婚。</td>
		<td class="en">The Prince made him a splendid present as a reward for this good news, and at once sent ambassadors to ask the Dear Little Princess in marriage.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >公主的父王同意了这门婚事。海辛斯王子急着见到公主，走了三里格终于见到了她。他刚要上前亲吻公主的手，令在场的人不寒而栗的事情就发生了，巫师像闪电一般倏然出现了，一把抓住公主把她卷走了。</td>
		<td class="en">The King, her father, gave his consent; and Prince Hyacinth, who, in his anxiety to see the Princess, had gone three leagues to meet her was just advancing to kiss her hand when, to the horror of all who stood by, the enchanter appeared as suddenly as a flash of lightning, and, snatching up the Dear Little Princess, whirled her away out of their sight!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >王子伤心欲绝，发誓在找到公主之前绝不回自己的王国。拒绝了大臣们的随扈，他骑上马伤心地走了，任由马儿自己选择道路。</td>
		<td class="en">The Prince was left quite unconsolable, and declared that nothing should induce him to go back to his kingdom until he had found her again, and refusing to allow any of his courtiers to follow him, he mounted his horse and rode sadly away, letting the animal choose his own path.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他漫无目的地来到了一片平原，在平原上走了一整天他都没有看到一座房子，王子和他的马都饿坏了。夜幕降临的时候，王子看到了一点儿亮光，好像是从洞穴里发出来的。</td>
		<td class="en">So it happened that he came presently to a great plain, across which he rode all day long without seeing a single house, and horse and rider were terribly hungry, when, as the night fell, the Prince caught sight of a light, which seemed to shine from a cavern.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他骑马过去，看到了一位老妇人，她看上去至少有一百岁了。</td>
