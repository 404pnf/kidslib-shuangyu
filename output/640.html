		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对于热爱艺术只为艺术本身的人来说，”歇洛克·福尔摩斯一边说，一将《每日电讯报》的启事专版扔到了一边，“艺术的最大乐趣往往蕴藏在它最无足轻重、最卑微渺小的表现形式之中。华生啊，看了你费心为咱们的案子留下的这些篇幅短小的忠实记录，以及，恕我直言，偶尔出现的夸张叙述，我非常高兴地发现，你已经领会了这条真理，因为你选材的重点并不是我曾经参与的诸多轰动性案件以及爆炸性审判，而是另外一类案件，它们牵涉的事由兴许微不足道，但却为我独擅胜场的演绎本领和逻辑综合能力提供了用武之地。”</td>
		<td class="en">“To the man who loves art for its own sake,” remarked Sherlock Holme s , tos s ing a s ide the advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph, “it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many causes célèbres and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“话虽然这么说，”我笑着说道，“还是有人指责我这些记录使用了哗众取宠的手法，而我并不能担保绝无此事[^2]。”</td>
		<td class="en">“And yet,” said I, smiling, “I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你的失误，兴许在于，”他一边说，一边用火钳夹起一块红彤彤的炉渣，点燃了他那个长长的樱桃木烟斗。逞强好辩的时候，他通常都会用樱桃木烟斗来取代苦思冥想时所用的陶土烟斗。“你的失误兴许在于，你总想给自己的叙述添上色彩与生气，因此就没有一心一意地记录精密严谨的因果演绎过程，与此同时，认真说的话，这样的演绎过程是探案工作当中唯一的一个值得留意的地方。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You have erred, perhaps,” he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood—“you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我倒是觉得，就这件事情来说，我对你可没有什么不公正的地方，”我的语气多少有些冷淡，因为他这种自我中心的态度惹起了我的反感。自我中心是我朋友特异性格之中的一个显著特征，之前我就已经领教过不止一次了。</td>
		<td class="en">“It seems to me that I have done you fulljustice in the matter, ” I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend’s singular character.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不对，我这可不是自私，也不是自负，”跟他平日里的习惯一样，他这句回答针对的并不是我说出来的话，而是我脑子里的想法。“我之所以要为自己的手艺讨要一个完全公正的评价，仅仅因为它是一件不带个人色彩的事物、一件超越我自身范畴的事物。罪行司空见惯，逻辑却凤毛麟角。所以说，你关注的焦点应该是逻辑，而不是罪行。这些记录本该是由一系列讲座构成的一门课程，你却让它们堕落成了一连串的故事。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No, it is not selfishness or conceit,” said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. “If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing—a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course oflectures into a series of tales.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这是一个寒冷的初春早晨，我俩已经用过了早餐，眼下是分坐在贝克街旧寓里一团惬意炉火的两边。浓重的黄色雾气在一排排灰褐色的房屋之间翻涌流动，街道对面的一扇扇窗子变成了浓雾背后的一个个轮廓模糊的暗影。仆人还没有来收拾我们的餐桌，煤气灯映照着白色的台布，陶瓷和金属餐具在灯光之中闪闪发亮。歇洛克·福尔摩斯整个早上都没有开口，只顾着蜻蜓点水似地翻阅各种报纸的启事专栏，最后则显然是放弃了搜寻的努力，肚子里装满了某种不那么愉快的情绪，开始喋喋不休地念叨我瑕疵累累的文笔。</td>
		<td class="en">It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of duncoloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他坐在那里，一边就着自己的长烟斗吞云吐雾，一边直勾勾地盯着炉火。“与此同时，”片刻之后，他又开了口，“你倒是无需承受哗众取宠的指责，原因在于，你惠然垂注的这些案件当中有相当大的一部分根本就不涉及法律意义上的罪行，举例说吧，我给波希米亚国王帮的那次小忙、玛丽·萨瑟兰小姐的奇特经历、与翻唇男人相关的那个问题，还有那位单身贵族遭遇的意外变故，这几件事情都不在法律管辖的范围之内。另一方面，据我看，你这只脚离开了哗众取宠的深渊，那只脚恐怕又走到了琐碎无聊的边缘。”</td>
		<td class="en">“At the same time,” he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, “you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“从作品的效果来看，你也许没说错，”我回答道，“不过，自始至终，我用的都是一种既新颖又有趣的写作手法。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The end may have been so,” I answered, “but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“得了吧，我亲爱的伙计，你面对的公众不过是一大群毫无观察力可言的庸碌之徒，既不能通过牙齿看出别人的织工身份，也不能通过左手的拇指看出对方是个排字工，他们连这么简单的事情都做不到，哪里还会去关心分析与演绎的各种精妙变化！不过，说实在的，琐碎无聊也不是你的过错，怪只怪孕育伟大罪案的时代已经一去不返。人们，至少是以身试法的人们，已经丧失了所有的开拓精神，丧失了所有的创造能力。我自个儿这间小小的事务所呢，似乎也堕入了江河日下的境地，正在变成一家穷极无聊的代理机构，业务无非是帮人家找找失踪的铅笔，要不就是给那些来自寄宿学校的年青女士出出主意。可是，依我看，今天我才算是终于跌到了谷底。今天早上收到的这张便笺，要我说，正好可以充当我彻底堕落的标志。读读吧！”说到这里，他隔着桌子把一封皱巴巴的信扔到了我面前。</td>
		<td class="en">“Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency forecovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!” He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这封信发自蒙塔古广场，时间是昨天傍晚，内容如下：</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是啊，毫无疑问，正在拉门铃的就是她。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“到头来，事情说不定会比你预想的有趣哩。你应该还记得蓝色石榴石那件案子吧，刚开始似乎只是你突发奇想的消遣，后来却变成了一次正儿八经的调查。这件案子，也有可能是这种情况啊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“呃，咱们尽可以这么期望。不管怎么说，咱们的疑问马上就会得到解答，因为当事人已经到了，如果我没搞错的话。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >话音未落，房门开了，一位年青的女士走了进来。她一身朴素整洁的打扮，聪慧活泼的脸庞上点缀一些雀斑，仿佛是鸻蛋上的斑点[^3]。她的举止轻快伶俐，一看就是个独闯天下的自强女子。</td>
		<td class="en">As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover’s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“冒昧打扰，您一定得多多包涵，”我室友起身招呼她的时候，她开口说道，“可我遇上了一件非常离奇的事情，又没有父母或者亲友来帮我出主意，所以我就想，您没准儿能给我一些好心的指引。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,” said she, as my companion rose to greet her, “but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“请坐，亨特小姐。我乐意尽我所能，为您效劳。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >看得出来，这位新主顾的举止和言辞给福尔摩斯留下了不错的印象。他用他那种探询的方式上下打量了她一番，然后就恢复了好整以暇的姿态，眼皮耷拉下去，双手的指尖拢在一起，开始听她讲述自己的故事。</td>
		<td class="en">I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我在斯彭斯·芒罗上校家里当了五年的家庭教师，”她说道，“可是，两个月之前，上校在新斯科舍的哈利法克斯[^4]谋得一个职位，带着孩子去了美洲，弄得我没了工作。我登了求职启事，还跑去应征了各式各样的招聘启事，始终都没有成功。到最后，我渐渐花光了仅有的一点点积蓄，完全不知道如何是好了。</td>
		<td class="en">“I have been a governess for five years,” said she, “in the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit’s end as to what I should do.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“西区有一家介绍家庭女教师的著名机构，名字叫做‘韦斯塔韦’，我每个星期都会上那里去一趟，看看有没有适合我的工作。韦斯塔韦是介绍所创办人的名字，真正管事的人则是斯托珀小姐。她坐在自个儿那间小办公室里，想找工作的女士都得在一间接待室里等着。她会挨个儿地把我们叫进去，然后再翻翻她那些登记簿，看看有没有适合我们的工作。</td>
		<td class="en">“There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway’s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是这样，上个星期我又去了那里，又像往常一样被人叫进了那间小小的办公室，但有一点不一样，办公室里不光是斯托珀小姐一个人。她身边坐着个特别魁梧的男人，满脸堆笑，又大又厚的下巴一层叠一层地耷拉到了喉咙上，鼻梁上架着一副眼镜，认认真真地打量着每一位走进房间的女士。我刚一进去，他就在自个儿的椅子上猛一激灵，立刻转向了斯托珀小姐。</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“‘That will do,’ said he; ‘I could not ask for anything better. Capital! Capital!’ He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“‘Oh, tut, tut! Sweating—rank sweating!’ he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. ‘How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?’</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“‘Tut, tut!’ he cried. ‘This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have, why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at a hundred pounds a year.’</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“‘It is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, ‘to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.’</td></tr>

He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects.

On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze.

I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o’clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child.

You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers—possibly her fiancé—and no doubt, as you wore the girl’s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions.

		<td class="en">“I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,” said Holmes, “for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our *locus standi* now is rather a questionable one.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如此这般，门前长着铜色山毛榉的那座凶宅里面不再有什么谜案。鲁卡斯尔先生活了下来，整个人却从此一蹶不振，全靠他忠实妻子的照料，他才能够苟延残喘。夫妻俩仍然跟以前的仆人生活在一起，兴许是因为那两名仆人太了解鲁卡斯尔先生的过去，致使鲁卡斯尔先生跟他俩难舍难分。逃走之后的第二天，福勒先生和鲁卡斯尔小姐就申请到了特许证书，在南安普敦[^12]结了婚。眼下，福勒先生已经是毛里求斯[^13]的一名政府雇员。说到维奥莱特·亨特小姐的事情，我朋友福尔摩斯的表现让我非常失望，原因在于，自打她不再是他手头案件的中心人物，他再也没有对她表示过任何关注。她如今是沃尔索尔[^14]一家私立学校的校长，我完全相信，在那个地方，她一定已经取得了斐然可观的成就。</td>
		<td class="en">And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle’s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.</td></tr>
