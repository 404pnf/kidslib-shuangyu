		<td class="en">Being a large man of considerable strength and perfect health, he earned good money in the pit.His natural courtesy saved him from enemies, while his fresh interest in life made his presence always agreeable.So he went his own way, had always plenty of friends, always a good job down pit.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“区别可大了。”老板娘回答说。</td>

		<td class="en">“You just let me consider a bit,” said the man.He took out a pocket-book and a pencil.The landlady continued to talk to the other guests.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >雷德福是个大块头，黑头发，棕色的八字须，有一双暗蓝色眼睛。他的嗓音生来低沉，而且有种奇特的男高音音质，有些沙哑，令人烦躁。他说话时总是调整音调，就像总和女人说话的男人们那样。他的举止中总是透着一种懒散的感觉。</td>
		<td class="en">Radford was a big fellow, black-haired, with a brown moustache, and darkish blue eyes.His voice, naturally deep, was pitched in his throat, and had a peculiar, tenor quality, rather husky, and disturbing.He modulated it a good deal as he spoke, as men do who talk much with women.Always, there was a certain indolence in his carriage.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我家当家的很懒。”他妻子说，“家里很多活需要做，但你倒是试试看能不能叫动他。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Our mester’s lazy,” his wife said.“There’s many a bit of a jab wants doin’, but get him to do it if you can.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是她知道他只是对一些琐碎的小事不感兴趣而已，并非懒散。</td>
		<td class="en">But she knew he was merely indifferent to the little jobs, and not lazy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他坐下来写东西，写了十来分钟，最后他念道：</td>
		<td class="en">He sat writing for about ten minutes, at the end of which time, he read:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我看到一个美丽的少女，充满活力。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而她的眉宇间透着妒意。</td>
		<td class="en">But there’s jealousy between her eyebrows.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >嘴角也露出一丝嫉妒。</td>
		<td class="en">And jealousy on her mouth.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我看见前路的烦恼。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她会帮不上他什么忙。</td>
		<td class="en">She would do him no good.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她永远不会看到他什么时候过得不好。</td>
		<td class="en">She would never see when he wasn’t well.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她只会看到自己的需求——”</td>
		<td class="en">She would only see what she wanted—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这样，他用一系列短句记下了自己的想法。他必须摸索着寻找表达方法，这样，任何他想说的比较严肃的话，他就写在自己所谓的“诗”里。</td>
		<td class="en">So, in phrases, he got down his thoughts.He had to fumble for expression, and therefore anything serious he wanted to say he wrote in “poetry”, as he called it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不久，老板娘站起来说：</td>
		<td class="en">Presently, the landlady rose, saying:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我得回去照看我们家当家的了。打烊之前我会再回来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, I s’ll have to be looking after our mester.I s’ll be in again before we close.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >雷德福继续舒舒服服地坐在那里。过了一会，他也和大家说晚安了。</td>
		<td class="en">Radford sat quite comfortably on.In a while, he too bade the company good-night.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他回到家已是十一点一刻了，儿子们都睡觉了，妻子坐着等他。她是个中等身高的女人，身材圆润，皮肤光滑，就像面团一样矮胖。她的黑头发分得很整齐，狭长的眼睛里透着狡黠和讽刺。她含糊的嗓音里夹杂了一种特有的鼻音。</td>
		<td class="en">When he got home, at a quarter past eleven, his sons were in bed, and his wife sat awaiting him.She was a woman of medium height, fat and sleek, a dumpling.Her black hair was parted smooth, her narrow-opened eyes were sly and satirical, she had a peculiar twang in her rather slurring voice.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们家太太是个风骚的女人。”他毫不费力地这样说她。她那极其光滑而富有光泽的脸非常引人注目。她非常健康。</td>
		<td class="en">“Our missis is a puss-puss,” he said easily, of her.Her extraordinarily smooth, sleek face was remarkable.She was very healthy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他从未醉醺醺地回家。他脱下外套，摘了帽子，穿着衬衫坐下来吃晚饭。尽管他有这样那样的举动，他还是令她着迷。他颈部强健，长着一头卷曲的长发。她要生气就让她生气吧，但她依然爱他的脖颈，特别是当她看到皮肤下突出的青筋时。</td>
		<td class="en">He never came in drunk.Having taken off his coat and his cap, he sat down to supper in his shirt-sleeves.Do as he might, she was fascinated by him.He had a strong neck, with the crisp hair growing low.Let her be angry as she would yet she had a passion for that neck of his, particularly when she saw the great vein rib under the skin.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“太太，”他说道，“我不想吃这肉，我更想来点奶酪。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I think, missis,” he said, “I’d rather ha’e a smite o’ cheese than this meat.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，难道你不能自己去取吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, can’t you get it yourself?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊，当然能了。”他回答，并走向食品储藏室。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yi, surely I can,” he said, and went out to the pantry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想如果你这么晚才回来，你可以自己服侍自己。”她为自己开脱。</td>
		<td class="en">“I think, if yer comin’ in at this time of night, you can wait on yourself,” she justified herself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她坐在椅子上，不安地晃动着。他端过来一个盘子，里面除了奶酪，还有一些果酱馅饼。</td>
		<td class="en">She moved uneasily in her chair.There were several jam-tarts alongside the cheese on the dish he brought.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“呃，太太，厨房的垫子坏了。”他说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yi, Missis, them tan-tafflins’ll go down very nicely,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，是吗！既然这样你最好帮帮忙，掏钱修理一下。”她语气温和但很坚定地说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, will they!Then you’d better help to pay for them,” she said, amiably, but determined.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你想干什么？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Now what art after?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想干什么？怎么，你就不能想想看吗？”她语带讽刺地说。</td>
		<td class="en">“What am I after?Why, can’t you think?” she said sarcastically.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“太太，我想东西这方面不行。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m not for thinkin’, missis.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，我知道你不擅长。但是给我的钱在哪儿呢？你今天从工会那里拿到钱了。我从哪里拿钱呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“No, I know you’re not.But wheer’s my money?You’ve been paid the Union today.Wheer do I come in?”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Thank yer.An’ ‘aven’t you none, as well?”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“事情就是这样。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Appen so.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“工会发的钱我们应该共享。”她说，“只有这么做才是正确的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“We’ll go shares wi’ th’ Union money,” she said.“That’s nothing but what’s right.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们不会这么做。你有很多钱可以用啊。”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，好吧，”她说道，“我会用的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, all right,” she said.“I will do.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她上床休息去了。她没能说动他，这让她感到焦躁。</td>
		<td class="en">She went to bed.It made her feel sharp that she could not get at him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二天，她和平日没什么两样。但到了十一点钟，她带上钱包去了城里。街上生意很冷清。人们一帮一帮地闲站着，街上到处是玩弹珠的人。这天早上天气晴朗。雷德福夫人来到一家家具装潢店。</td>
		<td class="en">The next day, she was just as usual.But at eleven o’clock she took her purse and went up town.Trade was very slack.Men stood about in gangs, men were playing marbles everywhere in the streets.It was a sunny morning.Mrs. Radford went into the furnisher-and-upholsterer’s shop.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“有几样东西，”她对奥尔科克先生说，“我打算买回家，我也许现在就该买下来，正好男人们在家，能帮我搬运家具。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There’s a few things,” she said to Mr. Allcock, “as I’m wantin’ for the house, and I might as well get them now, while the men’s at home, and can shift me the furniture.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >咔哒一声，她把鼓鼓的钱包放在了柜台上。应该让奥尔科克知道，她不是想要“记在账上”。她为厨房买了油地毡，还买了一台新的绞拧机，一套早餐餐具，一个弹簧床垫，还有些其他东西，只剩下了三十先令。她将它们包在手绢一角，打好结。钱包里只有些零钱了。</td>
		<td class="en">She put her fat purse on to the counter with a click.The man should know she was not wanting “strap”.She bought linoleum for the kitchen, a new wringer, a breakfast-service, a spring mattress, and various other things, keeping a mere thirty shillings, which she tied in a corner of her handkerchief.In her purse was some loose silver.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她回家时，她的丈夫正在漫不经心地干着花园里的活。水仙开花了。花园那边的田野里，几匹马驹正仰起它们柔软的棕色的脖子。</td>
		<td class="en">Her husband was gardening in a desultory fashion when she got back home.The daffodils were out.The colts in the field at the end of the garden were tossing their velvety brown necks.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“太太，坐这里吧。”雷德福从小径中间的棚子里招呼道。两只鸽子在笼子里咕咕地叫着。</td>
		<td class="en">“Sithee here, missis,” called Radford, from the shed which stood halfway down the path.Two doves in a cage were cooing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你手里是什么？”女人走近他问道。他把满是泥土的大手伸向她，手里是只乌龟。这只爬行动物非常缓慢地再次探出头来取暖。</td>
		<td class="en">“What have you got?” asked the woman, as she approached.He held out to her in his big, earthy hand a tortoise.The reptile was very, very slowly issuing its head again to the warmth.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他醒得太早了。”雷德福说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“He’s wakkened up betimes,” said Radford.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“东西滚滚而至啊！”他叫道。</td>
		<td class="en">“They come rolling in!” he exclaimed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“关于厨房的破油地毡，还有谁比你抱怨得多？”他的妻子用她那狡猾的、猫一样的嗓音说道。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >雷德福跟着他出了门，还是他那种随意懒散的状态。他的妻子也跟了出来。他的马甲松松地披在衬衫外面。她跟着他，看他健康的身体和灵巧的动作，便暗自发笑。</td>
