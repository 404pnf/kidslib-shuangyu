		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >诸多故事中传说的夏日之月正将皎洁的月光倾洒在广阔无垠、绵延起伏的乡间原野上。那最皎洁的光芒，与一池泉水交相辉映。一路攀爬而上的旅人，跟作者一样都疲惫不堪，但大家都纷纷饮用山路旁涌出的泉水来解渴。在这造福人间的泉水四周，随处可见匠人们巧夺天工的艺术作品。泉水上方有个露天的蓄水池，那是把坚硬的石头凿开挖空后形成的。泉水漫到了池子的边缘，但没有一滴溢出，都从一些隐蔽的出水口流走了。池子里水已满，再多一滴也盛不下了，泉水不断喷涌，水面也波澜涟涟，但水却没有溢出，似乎有一种神秘的魔力。犹记得炎炎夏日中，当我气喘吁吁地坐在水池旁，饮着泉水解渴消暑时，我会产生一些古怪的想法，觉得大自然不会让如此纯净的水白白流走，不管是这口泉还是其他更次的泉眼。</td>
		<td class="en">The summer moon, which shines in so many a tale, was beaming over a broad extent of uneven country.Some of its brightest rays were flung into a spring of water, where no traveller, toiling, as the writer has, up the hilly road beside which it gushes, ever failed to quench his thirst.The work of neat hands and considerate art was visible about this blessed fountain.An open cistern, hewn and hollowed out of solid stone, was placed above the waters, which filled it to the brim, but by some invisible outlet were conveyed away without dripping down its sides.Though the basin had not room for another drop, and the continual gush of water made a tremor on the surface, there was a secret charm that forbade it to overflow.I remember, that when I had slaked my summer thirst, and sat panting by the cistern, it was my fanciful theory that Nature could not afford to lavish so pure a liquid, as she does the waters of all meaner fountains.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >皓月当空，山顶上出现了两个人影，他们朝泉水走来，悄无声息。他们正值青春年少，眉宇间没有任何皱纹的痕迹，但是穿着打扮古怪而过时。其中一位是个年轻男子，面色红润，戴着一顶灰色宽沿帽，穿着方边百褶大衣和齐膝马甲，这些貌似是他曾祖父留给他的。他棕色的长发束在身后，那种发式在我们这个时代已经看不到了。他的身旁站着一位甜美的少女，戴着一顶整洁的小软帽，遮住了那美丽的面庞，软帽下露出了修女戴的平纹细布头巾。她那修身的长袍，以及全身的装束，很可能是半个世纪前乡间美人的穿着。要不是他们身上还散发着温暖、充满着活力，我早就把他们当成了一对早已在炽热的恋情中死去的魂魄，如今游荡于坟墓之外，在洒满月光的泉边重温过去的誓言，再现生前那难忘的尘世之吻。</td>
		<td class="en">While the moon was hanging almost perpendicularly over this spot, two figures appeared on the summit of the hill, and came with noiseless footsteps down towards the spring.They were then in the first freshness of youth; nor is there a wrinkle now on either of their brows, and yet they wore a strange, old-fashioned garb.One, a young man with ruddy cheeks, walked beneath the canopy of a broad-brimmed gray hat; he seemed to have inherited his great-grandsire’s square-skirted coat, and a waistcoat that extended its immense flaps to his knees; his brown locks, also, hung down behind, in a mode unknown to our times.By his side was a sweet young damsel, her fair features sheltered by a prim little bonnet, within which appeared the vestal muslin of a cap; her close, long-waisted gown, and indeed her whole attire, might have been worn by some rustic beauty who had faded half a century before.But that there was something too warm and life-like in them, I would here have compared this couple to the ghosts of two young lovers who had died long since in the glow of passion, and now were straying out of their graves, to renew the old vows, and shadow forth the unforgotten kiss of their earthly lips, beside the moonlit spring.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们来到石池子旁，年轻人说道：“米里亚姆，你和我在这里休息一会儿。不用害怕长老们知道我们做过什么，这可能是我们最后一次饮这泉水了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Thee and I will rest here a moment, Miriam,” said the young man, as they drew near the stone cistern, “for there is no fear that the elders know what we have done; and this may be the last time we shall ever taste this water.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >说这话时，他的脸上露出了一丝哀愁，他的恋人也面带愁容。他让她坐到石头上，自己也打算挨着坐下，但她却温和地拒绝了。</td>
		<td class="en">Thus speaking, with a little sadness in his face, which was also visible in that of his companion, he made her sit down on a stone, and was about to place himself very close to her side; she, however, repelled him, though not unkindly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，乔赛亚，”她说道，用她的纤纤玉手羞怯地将他推开，“你必须要坐得再远一点儿，可以到泉水那头的石头上去。你要是坐得太近，姐妹们还不知道怎么说呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Nay, Josiah,” said she, giving him a timid push with her maiden hand, “thee must sit farther off, on that other stone, with the spring between us.What would the sisters say, if thee were to sit so close to me?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但我们现在已经是世俗之人了，米里亚姆。”乔赛亚回答道。</td>
		<td class="en">“But we are of the world’s people now, Miriam,” answered Josiah.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >少女执意要谨慎为好，而年轻人看上去还是很害羞，所以他们俩分开坐了下来，凝视着一座小山，那里的月光洒满了一片楼顶。他们正全神贯注的时候，一群旅人来到了泉边，停下来休息。他们刚从山下爬上来，疲惫不堪。他们中有三个男人、一个女人、一个女孩和一个男孩。他们衣衫褴褛，沾染着夏日的灰尘和晚露的潮气；他们都愁眉苦脸，似乎世间的烦恼和悲伤让他们的登山行程步履维艰。若是在倒霉的日子里，即便是那两个小孩也要比之前的那对年轻恋人看起来更显老。</td>
		<td class="en">The girl persisted in her prudery, nor did the youth, in fact, seem altogether free from a similar sort of shyness; so they sat apart from each other, gazing up the hill, where the moonlight discovered the tops of a group of buildings.While their attention was thus occupied, a party of travellers, who had come wearily up the long ascent, made a halt to refresh themselves at the spring.There were three men, a woman, and a little girl and boy.Their attire was mean, covered with the dust of the summer’s day, and damp with the night-dew; they all looked woebegone, as if the cares and sorrows of the world had made their steps heavier as they climbed the hill; even the two little children appeared older in evil days than the young man and maiden who had first approached the spring.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“年轻人，晚上好。”这些旅人打了个招呼；“晚上好，朋友们。”小伙子和少女答道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Good evening to you, young folks,” was the salutation of the travellers; and “Good evening, friends,” replied the youth and damsel.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那白色的房子是震颤派的礼拜堂吗？”其中一个陌生旅人问道，“那红顶的房屋是震颤派的村子吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Is that white building the Shaker meeting-house?” asked one of the strangers.“And are those the red roofs of the Shaker village?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“朋友，那是震颤派的村子。”乔赛亚犹豫了一下才说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Friend, it is the Shaker village,” answered Josiah, after some hesitation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >旅人们从一开始就觉得这两个年轻人的装束比较可疑，现在又责备起他们的意图。从目前的情景来看，这两人的意图显而易见，不会搞错。</td>
		<td class="en">The travellers, who, from the first, had looked suspiciously at the garb of these young people, now taxed them with an intention which all the circumstances, indeed, rendered too obvious to be mistaken.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“的确如此，朋友，”年轻人鼓起勇气说道，“米里亚姆和我天生相爱，我们要到尘世间去，按俗人的方式生活。你们知道，我们并没有违反这片土地上的法律；你们和长老们，谁都没有权力来干涉我们。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It is true, friends,” replied the young man, summoning up his courage.“Miriam and I have a gift to love each other, and we are going among the world’s people, to live after their fashion.And ye know that we do not transgress the law of the land; and neither ye, nor the elders themselves, have a right to hinder us.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是，你们觉得不告而别合适吗？”一位旅人问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yet you think it expedient to depart without leave-taking,” remarked one of the travellers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是，是的，”乔赛亚不太情愿地说，“因为乔布神父很难沟通；他已年迈，对他所谓的肉体的罪孽绝不宽容。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yea, ye-a,” said Josiah, reluctantly, “because father Job is a very awful man to speak with; and being aged himself, he has but little charity for what he calls the iniquities of the flesh.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好吧，”那陌生旅人说道，“我们绝不会把你们强行押回村里，也不会向长老们出卖你们。但请你们在这里坐一坐，听我们说说那个我们已经离开而你们将要去的世界，或许到时你们就会自愿跟我们回去。你们觉得如何？”他转向他的同伴们问道，“我们已经走了这么远，但互相还不认识。我们是不是该在这淙淙清泉边聊聊自己的故事，消磨一下时间，也对这对误入歧途的年轻恋人有点儿好处？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well,” said the stranger, “we will neither use force to bring you back to the village, nor will we betray you to the elders.But sit you here awhile, and when you have heard what we shall tell you of the world which we have left, and into which you are going, perhaps you will turn back with us of your own accord.What say you?” added he, turning to his companions.“We have travelled thus far without becoming known to each other.Shall we tell our stories, here by this pleasant spring, for our own pastime, and the benefit of these misguided young lovers?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在这个提议下，旅人们都围坐到石池子旁边；两个孩子已经累坏了，在潮湿的地上睡着了。那个有着修女或土耳其女人情怀的震颤派美丽少女，悄悄挪到了那个女旅人身旁，尽量离那些陌生男人远一点儿。之前发言最多的那人站了起来，挥了挥手中的帽子，让月光照亮他的正面。</td>
		<td class="en">In accordance with this proposal, the whole party stationed themselves round the stone cistern; the two children, being very weary, fell asleep upon the damp earth, and the pretty Shaker girl, whose feelings were those of a nun or a Turkish lady, crept as close as possible to the female traveller, and as far as she well could from the unknown men.The same person who had hitherto been the chief spokesman now stood up, waving his hat in his hand, and suffered the moonlight to fall full upon his front.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“在我身上，”他的语气相当庄重，“在我身上，你们看到的是一位诗人。”</td>
		<td class="en">“In me,” said he, with a certain majesty of utterance,—“in me, you behold a poet.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >虽然这位先生现在还留有一幅自己的平版画像，但是可以看得出来他已年近四十，有点儿消瘦和驼背，穿了件破旧的黑外套。尽管他衣衫褴褛，但身上流露出几分特别的纨绔气息。尤其是他的发型，显得额头又高又宽，这与成熟男人的气质不太相符。但是，他的眼睛充满了智慧，总体来说，他脸部轮廓分明。</td>
		<td class="en">Though a lithographic print of this gentleman is extant, it may be well to notice that he was now nearly forty, a thin and stooping figure, in a black coat, out at elbows; notwithstanding the ill condition of his attire, there were about him several tokens of a peculiar sort of foppery, unworthy of a mature man, particularly in the arrangement of his hair which was so disposed as to give all possible loftiness and breadth to his forehead.However, he had an intelligent eye, and, on the whole, a marked countenance.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一位诗人！”震颤派年轻人重复了一遍，有些迷惑这个称谓该怎么理解，因为在他生活的那个讲求实用的社会里，很少听到这个字眼。“噢，哎，米里亚姆，他是指寺匠（诗匠） ，你得知道。”</td>
		<td class="en">“A poet!” repeated the young Shaker, a little puzzled how to understand such a designation, seldom heard in the utilitarian community where he had spent his life.“Oh, ay, Miriam, he means a varse-maker, thee must know.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这种说法刺痛了这位诗人敏感的神经；他不禁想知道，是怎样奇特的人生竟让这年轻人叫出这样一个称号，一个会让心术不正的人认定比他自封的“诗人”更名副其实的称号。</td>
		<td class="en">This remark jarred upon the susceptible nerves of the poet; nor could he help wondering what strange fatality had put into this young man’s mouth an epithet, which ill-natured people had affirmed to be more proper to his merit than the one assumed by himself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“的确，我是一个诗匠，”他继续说道，“但是我的诗不过是一个形体，我将思想的神圣灵魂注入其中。哎呀！你们体会不出诗歌的灵气和美妙，这让我心里阵阵疼痛，现在我正要与我的诗匠生涯永别，你们却又拿它来折磨我！哦。命运啊！你为何要与造物主抗争，她赋予我更超凡出群的才华，你却将我拥有的一切毁掉？若是世上少了那懂得欣赏的人，歌声又算什么？若是那强烈而又细腻的情感只能带来哀伤，我又如何高兴得起来？我像惧怕死亡那样害怕别人的嘲讽，像他人渴望救命的空气那样渴望成名，难倒只为看到自己在默默无闻与声名狼藉之间挣扎吗？但是我会报仇！我本可以写出成千上万篇璀璨诗作。我却把它们揉碎在我的心里，让它们在那里腐烂！我向我的同胞抖落脚上的尘土！但是，当子孙后代沿着我的足迹疲惫地爬上这里时，他们会为这个可耻的时代感到羞愧。这世道竟把一位美国诗歌之父赶到了一个震颤派的村子，让他在此度过余生！”</td>
		<td class="en">“True, I am a verse-maker,” he resumed, “but my verse is no more than the material body into which I breathe the celestial soul of thought.Alas! how many a pang has it cost me, this same insensibility to the ethereal essence of poetry, with which you have here tortured me again, at the moment when I am to relinquish my profession forever!O Fate! why hast thou warred with Nature, turning all her higher and more perfect gifts to the ruin of me, their possessor?What is the voice of song, when the world lacks the ear of taste?How can I rejoice in my strength and delicacy of feeling, when they have but made great sorrows out of little ones?Have I dreaded scorn like death, and yearned for fame as others pant for vital air, only to find myself in a middle state between obscurity and infamy?But I have my revenge!I could have given existence to a thousand bright creations.I crush them into my heart, and there let them putrefy!I shake off the dust of my feet against my countrymen!But posterity, tracing my footsteps up this weary hill, will cry shame upon the unworthy age that drove one of the fathers of American song to end his days in a Shaker village!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这人慷慨陈词，激情澎湃，时不时配上手势，由于诗歌是抒发情感的天然文体，因此把他最后迸发的激情理解为即兴的诗作，似乎也不无道理。读者必须知道，虽然他言辞激烈，但他还是一个善良、温柔、无恶意的可怜人。造物主造他时没看配方就把原料胡乱一堆，结果送他到这个世界来时，他某方面的才能太多，其他方面的又太少。</td>
		<td class="en">During this harangue, the speaker gesticulated with great energy, and, as poetry is the natural language of passion, there appeared reason to apprehend his final explosion into an ode extempore.The reader must understand that, for all these bitter words, he was a kind, gentle, harmless, poor fellow enough, whom Nature, tossing her ingredients together without looking at her recipe, had sent into the world with too much of one sort of brain, and hardly any of another.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“朋友，”震颤派的年轻人有点儿困惑，“你似乎遇到了很大的麻烦。而且，若是——若是我知道的话，不用说，我肯定会同情你的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Friend,” said the young Shaker, in some perplexity, “thee seemest to have met with great troubles; and, doubtless, I should pity them, if—if I could but understand what they were.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“无知者有无知的快乐！”诗人清高地回答道，“刚刚差点儿忘了说，对你这种头脑简单的人而言，我似乎要补充一些更重要的伤心事，那就是我现在一贫如洗、衣衫褴褛，快要饿死了。 不管怎样，还有我这么一个人给了你一点忠告，树立一个榜样，提醒你回头是岸；我来到此处，沮丧失落，不抱一丝希望，要到这世外桃源寻找安身之处，而你却急着要离开。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Happy in your ignorance!” replied the poet, with an air of sublime superiority.“To your coarser mind, perhaps, I may seem to speak of more important griefs when I add, what I had well-nigh forgotten, that I am out at elbows, and almost starved to death.At any rate, you have the advice and example of one individual to warn you back; for I am come hither, a disappointed man, flinging aside the fragments of my hopes, and seeking shelter in the calm retreat which you are so anxious to leave.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“谢谢你，朋友，”年轻人接过话，“但是我不想成为一个诗人，谢天谢地，米里亚姆也从未写过半句诗。因此我们无需担心会有你那样的失落感。但是，米里亚姆，”他确实有点儿忧心忡忡，“你知道长老是不会认可那些无实用技能之人的。现在，他们到底会怎样处置这个可怜的诗匠呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I thank thee, friend,” rejoined the youth, “but I do not mean to be a poet, nor, Heaven be praised! do I think Miriam ever made a varse in her life.So we need not fear thy disappointments.But, Miriam,” he added, with real concern, “thee knowest that the elders admit nobody that has not a gift to be useful.Now, what under the sun can they do with this poor varse-maker?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“别这样，乔赛亚，不要再打击这个可怜的人了，”少女真诚和善地说，“我们的圣歌还不完善，可能他们会委托他来润色一下。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Nay, Josiah, do not thee discourage the poor man,” said the girl, in all simplicity and kindness.“Our hymns are very rough, and perhaps they may trust him to smooth them.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >诗人转过身去，并没有注意到女孩在暗示他的职业还能派得上用场，接着便沉浸在他那所谓的“沉思”中了，实则却是虚无缥缈的白日梦。有时他会仰望月亮，看那月光如银色的液体一般倾泻到云上，慢慢融入云中，直到整片云散发出光芒；然后他看到这柔美的银光也在枝叶繁茂的树上舞蹈，枝叶沙沙作响，仿佛要抖落身上的月光，还看到月光在高高的山顶安睡，或像还未成形的梦，盘旋着落入远方的深谷；最后，他盯着泉水，那里月光和泉水交相辉映。它那晶莹剔透的胸脯倒映着整个天空，他在那上面找到了象征纯洁和宁静的乳房。他倾听着那最轻柔动听的声音，那随风飘来的蟋蟀的和声，幻想着，如果月光也能歌唱，那么它的声音便是这样吧。最后，他饮了一口震颤派的泉水，仿佛那是真正的灵感之泉，他马上就来了兴致，要作一首抒情诗，题为《永别了，我的竖琴》。他发誓这将是他的收官之作，是这个忘恩负义的世界从能从他那里得到的最后一首诗。这首诗和后来写的两三首小诗，他第一时间就让一个震颤派的教友把它们寄到了康科德，不久都发表在了《新罕布什尔郡爱国者》上。</td>
		<td class="en">Without noticing this hint of professional employment, the poet turned away, and gave himself up to a sort of vague reverie, which he called thought.Sometimes he watched the moon, pouring a silvery liquid on the clouds, through which it slowly melted till they became all bright; then he saw the same sweet radiance dancing on the leafy trees which rustled as if to shake it off, or sleeping on the high tops of hills, or hovering down in distant valleys, like the material of unshaped dreams; lastly, he looked into the spring, and there the light was mingling with the water.In its crystal bosom, too, beholding all heaven reflected there, he found an emblem of a pure and tranquil breast.He listened to that most ethereal of all sounds, the song of crickets, coming in full choir upon the wind, and fancied that, if moonlight could be heard, it would sound just like that.Finally, he took a draught at the Shaker spring, and, as if it were the true Castalia, was forthwith moved to compose a lyric, a Farewell to his Harp, which he swore should be its closing strain, the last verse that an ungrateful world should have from him.This effusion, with two or three other little pieces, subsequently written, he took the first opportunity to send, by one of the Shaker brethren, to Concord, where they were published in the New Hampshire Patriot.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >同时，坎特伯雷朝圣者中的另一个人开始讲述他的悲惨经历，他与刚刚那位诗人很不同，在他身上，找不到诗人那浪漫细腻、富于幻想的气质。他比较瘦小，动作敏捷，大约五十岁，额头狭窄，上面布满皱纹。他手里拿着一支铅笔和某个外地代理商的卡片，因为现在光线充足，适合读写，他似乎准备在卡片的背面做一个运算。</td>
		<td class="en">Meantime, another of the Canterbury pilgrims, one so different from the poet that the delicate fancy of the latter could hardly have conceived of him, began to relate his sad experience.He was a small man, of quick and unquiet gestures, about fifty years old, with a narrow forehead, all wrinkled and drawn together.He held in his hand a pencil, and a card of some commission-merchant in foreign parts, on the back of which, for there was light enough to read or write by, he seemed ready to figure out a calculation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“年青人”，他突然说道，“震颤派教徒在坎特伯雷拥有多少土地呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Young man,” said he, abruptly, “what quantity of land do the Shakers own here, in Canterbury?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“朋友，我也不是太清楚，”乔赛亚回答道，“但这是一个非常富裕的领地，你从那整齐的篱笆就可以猜出，马路两边一直延伸到远处的土地，都是我们的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“That is more than I can tell thee, friend,” answered Josiah, “but it is a very rich establishment, and for a long way by the roadside thee may guess the land to be ours, by the neatness of the fences.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那么整片土地的价值是多少呢，”那陌生旅人继续说道，“算上所有的建筑和改善设施，给一个整数？”</td>
		<td class="en">“And what may be the value of the whole,” continued the stranger, “with all the buildings and improvements, pretty nearly, in round numbers?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，很惊人的数字——大到我难以计算。”年轻的震颤派教徒回答道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, a monstrous sum,—more than I can reckon,” replied the young Shaker.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好吧，先生，”这个朝圣者说道，“不久前，有一天，我坐在记账室的窗边，看着自己船队中的三艘船挂着信号旗驶入港口，它们分别从东印度、利物浦和英吉利海峡归来，就算震颤派用所有的领地来换我一张货单我都不干，哪怕是那装货最少的船的货单。你瞪什么瞪。可能现在你不会相信，我怎么能让比你手掌还小的一张纸，竟比实实在在的大片耕地、草地和牧场还要值钱？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, sir,” said the pilgrim, “there was a day, and not very long ago, neither, when I stood at my counting-room window, and watched the signal flags of three of my own ships entering the harbor, from the East Indies, from Liverpool, and from up the Straits, and I would not have given the invoice of the least of them for the title-deeds of this whole Shaker settlement.You stare.Perhaps, now, you won’t believe that I could have put more value on a little piece of paper, no bigger than the palm of your hand, than all these solid acres of grain, grass, and pasture-land would sell for?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“朋友，我对此不会有任何异议，”乔赛亚答道，“但是我知道我宁愿要五十英亩的良田，也不想要你那一份文件。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I won’t dispute it, friend,” answered Josiah, “but I know I had rather have fifty acres of this good land than a whole sheet of thy paper.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你现在可以这么说，”潦倒的商人痛苦地说道，“因为我的名字还比不上一张要我在上面签名的纸值钱。当然，你肯定听说过我破产的事吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“You may say so now,” said the ruined merchant, bitterly, “for my name would not be worth the paper I should write it on.Of course, you must have heard of my failure?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这陌生旅人说了他的名字，然而无论他在商界多有势力，这个年轻的震颤派教徒在坎特伯雷从没听过他的名字。</td>
		<td class="en">And the stranger mentioned his name, which, however mighty it might have been in the commercial world, the young Shaker had never heard of among the Canterbury hills.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你居然没有听说过我破产的事！”商人激动地叫道，他相当生气。“怎么回事，伦敦股票市场上大家都在议论这事，从波士顿到新奥尔良，人们都怕得发抖。不管怎样，我确实破产了，而你在我赶往震颤派村子的路上遇见我（因为震颤派是个精明的教派），在那里，我的经历无疑会赢得他们的尊敬，他们会让我管理贸易方面的事务，这样我想我就能承诺在四五年内使他们的资产翻倍。跟我回去吧，年轻人，虽然你绝不会像我那么好运，但是你很难摆脱我碰到的那种厄运。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Not heard of my failure!” exclaimed the merchant, considerably piqued.“Why, it was spoken of on ‘Change in London, and from Boston to New Orleans men trembled in their shoes.At all events, I did fail, and you see me here on my road to the Shaker village, where, doubtless (for the Shakers are a shrewd sect), they will have a due respect for my experience, and give me the management of the trading part of the concern, in which case I think I can pledge myself to double their capital in four or five years.Turn back with me, young man; for though you will never meet with my good luck, you can hardly escape my bad.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我不会因为这些话就跟着你回去，”乔赛亚冷静地说道，“就像不会因为听了诗匠的劝告就回去一样。朋友啊，我觉得你和诗匠有某种相似之处，然而我也说不出来具体是哪一方面。但是米里亚姆和我不论是在人间尘世，还是在震颤派村庄里，都能够挣钱养活自己。我们还需要别的东西吗，米里亚姆？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I will not turn back for this,” replied Josiah, calmly, “any more than for the advice of the varse-maker, between whom and thee, friend, I see a sort of likeness, though I can’t justly say where it lies.But Miriam and I can earn our daily bread among the world’s people as well as in the Shaker village.And do we want anything more, Miriam?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不需要了，乔赛亚。”少女低声说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Nothing more, Josiah,” said the girl, quietly.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“Yea, Miriam, and daily bread for some other little mouths, if God send them,” observed the simple Shaker lad.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >米里亚姆没有回答，而是低头望着泉水，在那里她看到自己美丽的面庞在端庄的软帽下涨得通红。紧接着，第三位朝圣者开始讲话了。他是一个乡下人，晒得黝黑，身材高大，削瘦有力，粗犷的脸上男人味十足，但却比诗人和商人多了几分阴沉、固执和沮丧。</td>
		<td class="en">Miriam did not reply, but looked down into the spring, where she encountered the image of her own pretty face, blushing within the prim little bonnet.The third pilgrim now took up the conversation.He was a sunburnt countryman, of tall frame and bony strength, on whose rude and manly face there appeared a darker, more sullen and obstinate despondency, than on those of either the poet or the merchant.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，年轻人，”他开始说道，“这些伙伴们已经说完了，现在轮到我了。和他们的故事相比，我的经历算不上什么；因为我从不认为我能像这位一样，仅仅因为能给诗句押韵，我就能过上酒足饭饱的生活，受到别人的赞扬；我也不像那位商人，想要把大量的财富据为已有。我与你一般大时，我娶了个老婆——她就像这位米里亚姆小姐一样苗条灵巧、年轻美丽，要是我没记错这位小姐的名字的话——我所要求的就是上帝能保佑我们凭借自己的汗水努力过上体面舒适的生活，保佑我们不仅能养活自己，也能养活即将出世的孩子们。我们没有什么美好的前程；但也我们也不会无所事事；我以为上帝一定会帮我们，因为我们乐于自力更生。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, now, youngster,” he began, “these folks have had their say, so I’ll take my turn.My story will cut but a poor figure by the side of theirs; for I never supposed that I could have a right to meat and drink, and great praise besides, only for tagging rhymes together, as it seems this man does; nor ever tried to get the substance of hundreds into my own hands, like the trader there.When I was about of your years, I married me a wife,—just such a neat and pretty young woman as Miriam, if that’s her name,—and all I asked of Providence was an ordinary blessing on the sweat of my brow, so that we might be decent and comfortable, and have daily bread for ourselves, and for some other little mouths that we soon had to feed.We had no very great prospects before us; but I never wanted to be idle; and I thought it a matter of course that the Lord would help me, because I was willing to help myself.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没有，”乡下人郁闷地说道，“否则你也不会在这里见到我。我劳劳碌碌了很多年，但我的收入却越来越少，生活越来越苦，心越来越寒，心情越来越沉重，直到最后，我再也受不了了。我让自己静下来考虑是远走俄勒冈还是去震颤派的村庄；但是对于重新开始生活，我已经不抱什么希望了。长话短说，就这样，我到了这里。年轻人，现在听我的话，回去吧；否则几年以后，你也会和我一样怀着沉重的心情，不得不爬这座山。</td>
		<td class="en">“No,” said the yeoman, sullenly; “for then you would not have seen me here.I have labored hard for years; and my means have been growing narrower, and my living poorer, and my heart colder and heavier, all the time; till at last I could bear it no longer.I set myself down to calculate whether I had best go on the Oregon expedition, or come here to the Shaker village; but I had not hope enough left in me to begin the world over again; and, to make my story short, here I am.And now, youngster, take my advice, and turn back; or else, some few years hence, you’ll have to climb this hill, with as heavy a heart as mine.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个简单的故事对这两个出走的年轻人触动很大。他们想法淳朴，感情超脱世俗，因而诗人和商人的不幸并没有博得他们太多的同情。这也让他们看问题时能做到不偏不倚、立场坚定，所以对这年轻小伙子和少女的做法，不太有人敢评说是明智之举还是糊涂所为。但是这个乡下人，他那简单的愿望与他们的何其相似，他经过几番努力，眼看着就要从命运手中夺取成功，但还是以失败告终。</td>
		<td class="en">This simple story had a strong effect on the young fugitives.The misfortunes of the poet and merchant had won little sympathy from their plain good sense and unworldly feelings, qualities which made them such unprejudiced and inflexible judges, that few men would have chosen to take the opinion of this youth and maiden as to the wisdom or folly of their pursuits.But here was one whose simple wishes had resembled their own, and who, after efforts which almost gave him a right to claim success from fate, had failed in accomplishing them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“朋友啊，那你的妻子呢？”年轻人不禁惊呼，“那个像米里亚姆般漂亮的女子怎么样了？哦，恐怕她已经死了！”</td>
		<td class="en">“But thy wife, friend?” exclaimed the younger man.“What became of the pretty girl, like Miriam?Oh, I am afraid she is dead!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，可怜的人啊，她肯定是死了——还有她的孩子也死了。”米里亚姆啜泣道。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那位女朝圣者一直俯在泉上，只见水面泛起小小的涟漪，可能是她刚刚掉落的泪水。此时，她抬起头来，露出那依旧秀美的面庞，但神情焦虑，长期以来历经厄运，让这位贫困的农妇变得阴沉忧郁。</td>
		<td class="en">The female pilgrim had been leaning over the spring, wherein latterly a tear or two might have been seen to fall, and form its little circle on the surface of the water.She now looked up, disclosing features still comely, but which had acquired an expression of fretfulness, in the same long course of evil fortune that had thrown a sullen gloom over the temper of the unprosperous yeoman.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我就是他的妻子，”她说道，在她悲伤的口吻中能感觉到一丝愤怒，“睡在地上的可怜的小家伙，正是我们的两个孩子。我们原本还有两个孩子，但是上帝能给他们提供更好的条件，所以将他们带走了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I am his wife,” said she, a shade of irritability just perceptible in the sadness of her tone.“These poor little things, asleep on the ground, are two of our children.We had two more, but God has provided better for them than we could, by taking them to Himself.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对一个女人而言，拆散一对知心爱人是违背人性的，”农夫的妻子停了口气，然后说道，“但是，我将说出我的真实感受，就像这是我的临终遗言。虽然我的丈夫对你们说了我们的不幸，但是他没有提最大的不幸，因为它让其他一切不幸都变得难以忍受。如果你和你的爱人结婚，开始的一两年，你们会相亲相爱，如果一直是这样的话，你绝不会后悔；但是，慢慢地，他会变得越来越阴沉粗鲁，难以取悦，你也会变得牢骚满腹，爱发脾气，当他到外面去发泄苦恼时，你就会坐在火炉边抱怨连连；所以你们的爱会一点点消失，最终让你痛苦不堪。我们就是这样；我的丈夫和我还年轻的时候，曾经真心相爱过。</td>
		<td class="en">“‘Tis a thing almost against nature for a woman to try to part true lovers,” answered the yeoman’s wife, after a pause; “but I’ll speak as truly to you as if these were my dying words.Though my husband told you some of our troubles, he didn’t mention the greatest, and that which makes all the rest so hard to bear.If you and your sweetheart marry, you’ll be kind and pleasant to each other for a year or two, and while that’s the case, you never will repent; but, by and by, he’ll grow gloomy, rough, and hard to please, and you’ll be peevish, and full of little angry fits, and apt to be complaining by the fireside, when he comes to rest himself from his troubles out of doors; so your love will wear away by little and little, and leave you miserable at last.It has been so with us; and yet my husband and I were true lovers once, if ever two young folks were.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她停止讲话后，农夫和她互相看了对方一眼，他们的眼神中透露出几分温暖的爱意，他们的胸中之爱并没有像他们先前所想的那样，被无情的命运所冷却。此时，他们正处于婚姻生活的悬崖边，如果他们还对彼此存有信心，愿意答谢对方的话，一句动听的话，或者一个特别的眼神，都能让他们旧情复燃，重温昔日，任世间跌宕起伏，都会坚定地相互扶持下去。但是婚姻危机已经过去，而且永远不会再来了。正在这时，孩子们被母亲的说话声吵醒，他们抬起头来，嚎啕大哭，和那些坎特伯雷的朝圣者们一起声讨那个他们逃离了的世界。</td>
		<td class="en">As she ceased, the yeoman and his wife exchanged a glance, in which there was more and warmer affection than they had supposed to have escaped the frost of a wintry fate, in either of their breasts.At that moment, when they stood on the utmost verge of married life, one word fitly spoken, or perhaps one peculiar look, had they had mutual confidence enough to reciprocate it, might have renewed all their old feelings, and sent them back, resolved to sustain each other amid the struggles of the world.But the crisis passed and never came again.Just then, also, the children, roused by their mother’s voice, looked up, and added their wailing accents to the testimony borne by all the Canterbury pilgrims against the world from which they fled.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们累了，很饿！”他们叫道，“这离震颤派村庄还远吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“We are tired and hungry!” cried they.“Is it far to the Shaker village?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >震颤派的小伙子和少女都神情悲伤地看着对方。他们才踏出家门，就碰到一帮陌生人在他们面前讲述烦恼和伤心事，奉劝他们回家。这些陌生旅人各自的经历组成了一个寓言故事，不仅讲述了他人遭遇的悲惨命运，也向这对离家出走的恋人暗示，前进的道路上乌云密布，有破灭的希望、徒劳的艰辛、伤心的家务事和疏远的感情。但是犹豫片刻后，他们张开了双臂，给了彼此一个纯洁、温柔、被年轻人神化了的拥抱，然后作出了决定。</td>
		<td class="en">The Shaker youth and maiden looked mournfully into each other’s eyes.They had but stepped across the threshold of their homes, when lo! the dark array of cares and sorrows that rose up to warn them back.The varied narratives of the strangers had arranged themselves into a parable; they seemed not merely instances of woful fate that had befallen others, but shadowy omens of disappointed hope and unavailing toil,  grief and estranged affection, that would cloud the onward path of these poor fugitives.But after one instant’s hesitation, they opened their arms, and sealed their resolve with as pure and fond an embrace as ever youthful love had hallowed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们不会回去的，”他们说道，“世界对我们来说不再黑暗，因为我们会永远爱着对方。”</td>
		<td class="en">“We will not go back,” said they.“The world never can be dark to us, for we will always love one another.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后那些坎特伯雷的朝圣者上了山，这时诗人还吟诵了《永别了，我的竖琴》中描述沮丧绝望的诗节，为忧伤的羁人们配乐。他们在寻找一个家，一个他们之前的血缘或社会联系都被切断，过去所有的特征都被抹平，平淡漠然的安全感代替凡人的希望和恐惧的家，就像是另一个避难所——坟墓，那里住着为世间所遗弃的绝望之人。这对情人饮了震颤派的泉水，然后怀着纯洁的希望，但更多的是誓死不渝的感情，走向未知的生活。</td>
		<td class="en">Then the Canterbury pilgrims went up the hill, while the poet chanted a drear and desperate stanza of the Farewell to his Harp, fitting music for that melancholy band.They sought a home where all former ties of nature or society would be sundered, and all old distinctions levelled, and a cold and passionless security be substituted for mortal hope and fear, as in that other refuge of the world’s weary outcasts, the grave.The lovers drank at the Shaker spring, and then, with chastened hopes, but more confiding affections, went on to mingle in an untried life.</td></tr>
