		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一八九四年春天，罗纳德·阿代尔阁下不幸遇害。案发当时，这起无法解释的离奇谋杀不仅成为了全城关注的焦点，更让伦敦的上流社会惊愕莫名。警方在调查过程之中公布的种种罪行细节，公众皆已一一知悉。然而，相当一部分的案情并未公之于众，原因是检方的证据极其充分，无须将全部的事实呈上法庭。直到将近十年之后的今天，我才获准披露那些缺失的环节，将这根不同寻常的事件链条补充完整。就这件案子而言，罪行本身也不乏特异之处，然而，对我来说，罪行的特异之处根本不能与它那不可思议的衍生结果相提并论，后者是我不算平淡的一生中最大的震撼与惊奇。即便是现在，即便事情已经过去了这么长的时间，回想到它的时候，我依然觉得浑身战栗，觉得那片交织着欣喜、惊异和怀疑的潮水再一次淹没了我全部的神志。我曾经发表过一些零零星星的文字，讲述了一位杰出人物的思想和事迹，由此引起了一部分公众的兴趣。对于这部分公众，我想要说明的是，之前我没有跟他们分享我所知道的情况，并不是我有意藏私，因为我本来会把分享这些情况视为自己的第一要务，只可惜那位杰出人物亲口向我下达了严厉的禁令。直到上个月三号，这道禁令才告解除[^1]。</td>
		<td class="en">It was in the spring of the year 1894 that all London was interested, and the fashionable world dismayed, by the murder of the Honourable Ronald Adair under most unusual and inexplicable circumstances. The public has already learned those particulars of the crime which came out in the police investigation; but a good deal was suppressed upon that occasion, since the case for the prosecution was so overwhelmingly strong that it was not necessary to bring forward all the facts. Only now, at the end of nearly ten years, am I allowed to supply those missing links which make up the whole of that remarkable chain. The crime was of interest in itself, but that interest was as nothing to me compared to the inconceivable sequel, which afforded me the greatest shock and surprise of any event in my adventurous life. Even now, after this long interval, I find myself thrilling as I think of it, and feeling once more that sudden flood of joy, amazement, and incredulity which utterly submerged my mind. Let me say to that public, which has shown some interest in those glimpses which I have occasionally given them of the thoughts and actions of a very remarkable man that they are not to blame me if I have not shared my knowledge with them, for I should have considered it my first duty to have done so had I not been barred by a positive prohibition from his own lips, which was only withdrawn upon the third of last month.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可想而知，因为与歇洛克·福尔摩斯相知莫逆，我自己也对罪案产生了浓厚的兴趣。自从他失踪以后，我总是对见诸报端的各种案件读得格外仔细，甚至多次尝试用他的方法来寻找案件的谜底，效果虽然乏善可陈，自己也算是乐在其中。不过，所有的案件当中，最让我感兴趣的还是发生在罗纳德·阿代尔身上的这场惨剧。这件案子的死因调查报告[^2]提出了种种证据，结论是死者遭到了某个不明身份的人或者团伙的蓄意谋杀。读到这些报道，我比以往任何时候都更加清楚地意识到，对于我们的社会来说，歇洛克·福尔摩斯的死亡是多么巨大的损失。我完全肯定，这件奇案的特异之处必能让这位全欧第一神探跃跃欲试，而他训练有素的观察能力和机敏的头脑必能让警方从中受益，更大的可能则是让警方相形见绌。获悉案情之后，我四处出诊，忙碌了一整天，脑子里反复掂量着这件案子，但却始终找不出一个说得通的解释。在这里，我打算甘冒拾人牙慧的风险，把公众已经从死因调查报告当中了解到的事实概述一遍。</td>
		<td class="en">It can be imagined that my close intimacy with Sherlock Holmes had interested me deeply in crime, and that after his disappearance I never failed to read with care the various problems which came before the public, and I even attempted more than once for my own private satisfaction to employ his methods in their solution, though with indifferent success. There was none, however, which appealed to me like this tragedy of Ronald Adair. As I read the evidence at the inquest, which led up to a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown, I realized more clearly than I had ever done the loss which the community had sustained by the death of Sherlock Holmes. There were points about this strange business which would, I was sure, have specially appealed to him, and the efforts of the police would have been supplemented, or more probably anticipated, by the trained observation and the alert mind of the first criminal agent in Europe. All day as I drove upon my round I turned over the case in my mind, and found no explanation which appeared to me to be adequate. At the risk of telling a twice-told tale I will recapitulate the facts as they were known to the public at the conclusion of the inquest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >罗纳德·阿代尔阁下是梅努斯伯爵的次子[^3]，伯爵在某个澳大利亚属地担任总督[^4]。为了做白内障手术，阿代尔的母亲从澳大利亚返回英国，跟儿子罗纳德和女儿希尔达一起住在公园路427 号。小伙子活动的范围不出伦敦的上流社会，据大家所知，他既没有什么仇敌，也没有什么恶习。他跟来自卡斯泰尔斯[^5]的伊迪丝·伍德利小姐订过婚，几个月之前又经双方同意解除了婚约。不过，并没有迹象表明，此事造成了什么强烈的后遗症。从其他方面来看，小伙子的生活局限在一个非常保守的狭窄圈子之内，因为他不喜张扬，天性也比较淡漠。可是，一八九四年三月三十日晚上十点至十一点二十之间，死亡却以一种极其古怪、极其出人意表的方式落到了这位优哉游哉的年青贵族头上。</td>
		<td class="en">The Honourable Ronald Adair was the second son of the Earl of Maynooth, at that time governor of one of the Australian colonies. Adair’s mother had returned from Australia to undergo the operation for cataract, and she, her son Ronald, and her daughter Hilda were living together at 427, Park Lane. The youth moved in the best society had, so far as was known, no enemies, and no particular vices. He had been engaged to Miss Edith Woodley, of Carstairs, but the engagement had been broken off by mutual consent some months before, and there was no sign that it had left any very profound feeling behind it. For the rest the man’s life moved in a narrow and conventional circle, for his habits were quiet and his nature unemotional. Yet it was upon this easygoing young aristocrat that death came in most strange and unexpected form between the hours of ten and eleven-twenty on the night of March 30, 1894.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >罗纳德·阿代尔喜欢打牌，长年都在牌桌上鏖战，但却从来不会接受超出自己承受能力的赌注。他加入了三个纸牌俱乐部，分别是“鲍德温”、“卡文迪什”和“巴格代拉”。调查显示，死亡当天，吃过晚饭之后，他在巴格代拉俱乐部打了一轮惠斯特[^6]。同一天的下午，他也在那家俱乐部打过牌。跟他共桌的穆雷先生、约翰·哈迪爵士和莫兰上校都证明他们当时打的是惠斯特，大家的牌运也相去无几。阿代尔兴许是输了五镑，不可能更多。他的家底相当殷实，这点儿损失不会对他造成任何影响。他差不多天天都在这个或者那个俱乐部里打牌，同时又打得非常谨慎，通常都是以赢家的身份离场。相关证据还表明，几个星期之前，他曾经跟莫兰上校搭档，从戈弗雷·米尔纳和巴尔莫拉勋爵手里赢走了四百二十镑巨款。死因调查过程之中，大家对他近况的了解就是这些。</td>
		<td class="en">Ronald Adair was fond of cards playing continually, but never for such stakes as would hurt him. He was a member of the Baldwin, the Cavendish, and the Bagatelle card clubs. It was shown that after dinner on the day of his death he had played a rubber of whist at the latter club. He had also played there in the afternoon. The evidence of those who had played with him—Mr. Murray, Sir John Hardy, and Colonel Moran— showed that the game was whist, and that there was a fairly equal fall of the cards. Adair might have lost five pounds, but not more. His fortune was a considerable one, and such a loss could not in any way affect him. He had played nearly every day at one club or other, but he was a cautious player, and usually rose a winner. It came out in evidence that in partnership with Colonel Moran he had actually won as much as four hundred and twenty pounds in a sitting some weeks before from Godfrey Milner and Lord Balmoral. So much for his recent history, as it came out at the inquest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >案发当晚，他从俱乐部回到家里的时间是十点整。他的母亲和姐姐都出门串亲戚去了，女仆则宣誓证明，她听见他走进了三楼的前屋，也就是他平常使用的起居室。之前她已经在那个房间里生了火，还打开了房间的窗子，为的是把烟雾放出去。梅努斯夫人和女儿是十一点二十到的家，在此之前，他的房间里一直没有任何动静。回来之后，夫人打算去儿子的房间道个晚安，但却发现房门反锁，叫门也没有回应。她们找人撬开了房门，发现这个不幸的小伙子躺在桌子旁边，脑袋被一颗左轮手枪的开花弹打得惨不忍睹，房间里却找不到任何武器。桌子上有两张十镑的钞票，另有总值十七镑零十先令[^7]的金币和银币，这些钱码成了几个数额不等的小堆。桌子上还有一张纸，上面写着一些数字，数字后面是他在俱乐部里一些朋友的名字。大家由此推断，遇害之前，他正在计算牌桌上的输赢。</td>
		<td class="en">On the evening of the crime he returned from the club exactly at ten. His mother and sister were out spending the evening with a relation. The servant deposed that she heard him enter the front room on the second floor, generally used as his sitting-room. She had lit a fire there, and as it smoked she had opened the window. No sound was heard from the room until eleven-twenty, the hour of the return of Lady Maynooth and her daughter. Desiring to say good-night, she had attempted to enter her son’s room. The door was locked on the inside, and no answer could be got to their cries and knocking. Help was obtained and the door forced. The unfortunate young man was found lying near the table. His head had been horribly mutilated by an expanding revolver bullet, but no weapon of any sort was to be found in the room. On the table lay two bank-notes for ten pounds each and seventeen pounds ten in silver and gold, the money arranged in little piles of varying amount. There were some figures also upon a sheet of paper with the names of some club friends opposite to them, from which it was conjectured that before his death he was endeavouring to make out his losses or winnings at cards.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >仔细推敲这件案子的种种细节，结果只是让它显得更加扑朔迷离。第一个无法解答的疑问就是，小伙子为什么要反锁房门。当然，情形可能是凶手先把房门锁上，然后才跳窗离去。然而，那个房间离地面足足有二十英尺[^8]，正下方是一个花台，花台里的番红花开得正艳。花丛和土壤都没有任何遭受侵扰的迹象，屋子和大路之间的狭窄草坪上也没有任何足迹。这样看来，房门只可能是小伙子自己锁上的。可是，果真如此的话，他又是怎么死的呢？没有人能够从窗子爬进房间，同时又不留任何痕迹。如果说子弹来自窗外的话，能够用左轮手枪从远距离造成如此可怕的伤害，开枪的人真不知道是个怎样的射手。另一方面，公园路是一条非常热闹的通衢，离屋子不到一百码[^9]的地方就有一个马车车站。即便如此，仍然没有人听见枪声。话说回来，人的确已经死了，左轮手枪子弹也是明摆着的事实。弹头像软头弹那样，在命中死者的时候炸裂开来，想必是产生了瞬间夺命的效果。以上这些就是公园路谜案的案情，奇中之奇则是它完全没有动机。因为我已经说过，据大家所知，年青的阿代尔没有任何仇敌，房间里的钱财和贵重物品也都是原封未动的。</td>
		<td class="en">A minute examination of the circumstances served only to make the case more complex. In the first place, no reason could be given why the young man should have fastened the door upon the inside. There was the possibility that the murderer had done this and had afterwards escaped by the window. The drop was at least twenty feet, however, and a bed of crocuses in full bloom lay beneath. Neither the flowers nor the earth showed any sign of having been disturbed, nor were there any marks upon the narrow strip of grass which separated the house from the road. Apparently, therefore, it was the young man himself who had fastened the door. But how did he come by his death? No one could have climbed up to the window without leaving traces. Suppose a man had fired through the window, it would indeed be a remarkable shot who could with a revolver inflict so deadly a wound. Again, Park Lane is a frequented thoroughfare, and there is a cab-stand within a hundred yards of the house. No one had heard a shot. And yet there was the dead man, and there the revolver bullet, which had mushroomed out, as soft-nosed bullets will, and so inflicted a wound which must have caused instantaneous death. Such were the circumstances of the Park Lane Mystery, which were further complicated by entire absence of motive, since, as I have said, young Adair was not known to have any enemy, and no attempt had been made to remove the money or valuables in the room.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >整整一天，我翻来覆去地掂量着这些事实，希望能灵光乍现，想出一个可以涵盖所有事实的假设，由此找到这宗谜案的软肋，因为我那个身遭不幸的朋友曾经说过，所有案件都会有一条最适合下手的线索。说老实话，当时我并没有想出什么名堂。黄昏时分，我慢慢悠悠地穿过海德公园，大概六点钟的时候走到了公园路与牛津街交会的地方[^10]。公园路的人行道上站着一群闲人，全都在仰着脑袋窥视同一扇窗户，由此向我指明了我专程来察看的那座房子。一个戴着有色眼镜的瘦高男人正在那里宣讲他对案情的一些推测，其他人都围在他身边倾听。我暗自猜测，此人十有八九是一名便衣探员。我竭力挤到他的面前，可他的言论听起来十分荒唐，我觉得有点儿厌恶，于是又从人群里退了出来。退出来的时候，我撞到了身后一个模样丑怪的老头，碰掉了他手里的几本书。我记得，帮他把书捡起来的时候，我看到其中的一本是《树木崇拜的起源》，由此推测他是个穷酸的爱书人，收集僻书可能是为了生意，也可能是为了兴趣。我忙不迭地向他道歉，不巧的是，在主人看来，这几本书显然是十分宝贵的物事，而我对它们的凌虐实在是无理之至。只见他轻蔑地吼了一声，转身就走，佝偻的脊背和白色的连鬓胡子渐渐消失在了人群之中。</td>
		<td class="en">All day I turned these facts over in my mind, endeavouring to hit upon some theory which could reconcile them all, and to find that line of least resistance which my poor friend had declared to be the starting-point of every investigation. I confess that I made little progress. In the evening I strolled across the Park, and found myself about six o’clock at the Oxford Street end of Park Lane. A group of loafers upon the pavements, all staring up at a particular window, directed me to the house which I had come to see. A tall, thin man with coloured glasses, whom I strongly suspected of being a plainclothes detective, was pointing out some theory of his own, while the others crowded round to listen to what he said. I got as near him as I could, but his observations seemed to me to be absurd, so I withdrew again in some disgust. As I did so I struck against an elderly deformed man, who had been behind me, and I knocked down several books which he was carrying. I remember that as I picked them up I observed the title of one of them, *The Origin of Tree Worship*, and it struck me that the fellow must be some poor bibliophile who, either as a trade or as a hobby, was a collector of obscure volumes. I endeavoured to apologize for the accident, but it was evident that these books which I had so unfortunately maltreated were very precious objects in the eyes of their owner. With a snarl of contempt he turned upon his heel, and I saw his curved back and white side-whiskers disappear among the throng.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我在公园路427号观察了一阵，我关心的问题却依旧毫无头绪。房子和街道之间隔着一段带栏杆的矮墙，矮墙和栏杆的高度加起来也超不过五英尺，这样看来，任何人想要翻墙进入花园都不是什么难事。然而，那个房间的窗子是根本无法企及的，因为墙上并没有水管之类可以借力的东西，身手再好也爬不上去。于是我顺着原路走回肯辛顿街区，脑子里比先前还要迷惑。我刚在自己的书房里待了不到五分钟，女仆就进来通报，说有个人想要见我。叫我万分惊讶的是，来的不是别人，正是我素昧平生的那位老书迷。他嶙峋枯槁的脸庞从满头白发之中支棱出来，右胳膊下面夹着一堆他爱如珍宝的书籍，至少得有十来本。</td>
		<td class="en">My observations of No. 427, Park Lane did little to clear up the problem in which I was interested. The house was separated from the street by a low wall and railing, the whole not more than five feet high. It was perfectly easy, therefore, for anyone to get into the garden, but the window was entirely inaccessible, since there was no water-pipe or anything which could help the most active man to climb it. More puzzled than ever I retraced my steps to Kensington. I had not been in my study five minutes when the maid entered to say that a person desired to see me. To my astonishment it was none other than my strange old book-collector, his sharp, wizened face peering out from a frame of white hair, and his precious volumes, a dozen of them at least, wedged under his right arm.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“看到我您一定很惊讶吧，先生，”他用一种古怪的沙哑嗓音说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“You’re surprised to see me, sir,” said he, in a strange, croaking voice.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我承认我确实很惊讶。</td>
		<td class="en">I acknowledged that I was.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是这样，我这个人并不是不识好歹，先生。刚才我一瘸一拐地跟在您身后，碰巧看到您走进了这座房子，于是我就想，我不妨进去看看这位好心的绅士，跟他解释一下，刚才我态度虽然有点儿粗暴，可我并没有什么恶意。我还想告诉他，他帮我把书捡了起来，我心里是非常感激的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, I’ve a conscience, sir, and when I chanced to see you go into this house, as I came hobbling after you, I thought to myself, I’ll just step in and see that kind gentleman, and tell him that if I was a bit gruff in my manner there was not any harm meant, and that I am much obliged to him for picking up my books.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这不过是件小事情，您言重了，”我说道，“容我问您一句，您是怎么认出我的呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“You make too much of a trifle,” said I. “May I ask how you knew who I was?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“呃，先生，如果不是特别高攀的话，我跟您也算是街坊，因为我那个小书店就在教堂街的拐角，欢迎您过去看看，真的。您没准儿也有藏书的爱好吧，先生。您瞧，我这有《英国鸟类》、《卡图卢斯诗集》[^11]，还有《神圣战争》，价钱都非常划算。您不妨挑上五本，刚好可以把您书柜第二层的空位填上。现在的样子看着可不太整齐，对吧，先生？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, sir, if it isn’t too great a liberty, I am a neighbour of yours, for you’ll find my little bookshop at the corner of Church Street, and very happy to see you, I am sure. Maybe you collect yourself, sir; here’s *British Birds*, and *Catullus*, and *The Holy War*—a bargain every one of them. With five volumes you could just fill that gap on that second shelf. It looks untidy, does it not, sir?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我扭头看了看身后的书柜，回过身来的时候，站在眼前的人已经变成了歇洛克·福尔摩斯，正在隔着书桌冲我微笑。我站了起来，直勾勾地盯着他看了几秒钟，然后呢，我多半是做出了一个空前绝后的举动，当场晕了过去。毫无疑问的是，我眼前的确腾起了一股灰蒙蒙的雾气。雾气消散之后，我发现自己的领口已经松开，嘴里还泛着白兰地[^12]的辛辣余味。福尔摩斯俯身对着我，手里拿着他随身携带的扁酒壶。</td>
		<td class="en">I moved my head to look at the cabinet behind me. When I turned again Sherlock Holmes was standing smiling at me across my study table. I rose to my feet, stared at him for some seconds in utter amazement, and then it appears that I must have fainted for the first and the last time in my life. Certainly a grey mist swirled before my eyes, and when it cleared I found my collar-ends undone and the tingling after-taste of brandy upon my lips. Holmes was bending over my chair, his flask in his hand.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“I am all right, but indeed, Holmes, I can hardly believe my eyes. Good heavens, to think that you—you of all men— should be standing in my study!” Again I gripped him by the sleeve and felt the thin, sinewy arm beneath it. “Well, you’re not a spirit, anyhow,” said I. “My dear chap, I am overjoyed to see you. Sit down and tell me how you came alive out of that dreadful chasm.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他在我对面坐了下来，点起一支香烟，神态跟以往一样淡漠。那件褴褛的外套仍然裹在他的身上，刚才的那个书店老板却已经无影无踪，变成了桌子上的一团白发和一堆旧书。一眼望去，他的身材比以往还要瘦削，神色也比以往还要机警，可他鹰隼一般的脸白得吓人，让我知道他近来的生活很不健康。</td>
		<td class="en">He sat opposite to me and lit a cigarette in his old nonchalant manner. He was dressed in the seedy frock-coat of the book merchant, but the rest of that individual lay in a pile of white hair and old books upon the table.

		<td class="en">“I am glad to stretch myself, Watson,” said he. “It is no joke when a tall man has to take a foot off his stature for several hours on end. Now, my dear fellow, in the matter of these explanations we have, if I may ask for your co-operation, a hard and dangerous night’s work in front of us.

		<td class="en">“No, Watson, I never was in it. My note to you was absolutely genuine. I had little doubt that I had come to the end of my career when I perceived the somewhat sinister figure of the late Professor Moriarty standing upon the narrow pathway which led to safety. I read an inexorable purpose in his grey eyes. I exchanged some remarks with him, therefore, and obtained his courteous permission to write the short note which you afterwards received. I left it with my cigarette-box and my stick and I walked along the pathway, Moriarty still at my heels. When I reached the end I stood at bay. He drew no weapon, but he rushed at me and threw his long arms around me. He knew that his own game was up, and was only anxious to revenge himself upon me. We tottered together upon the brink of the fall. I have some knowledge, however, of bartitsu, or the Japanese system of wrestling, which has more than once been very useful to me. I slipped through his grip, and he with a horrible scream kicked madly for a few seconds and clawed the air with both his hands. But for all his efforts he could not get his balance, and over he went. With my face over the brink I saw him fall for a long way. Then he struck a rock, bounded off, and splashed into the water.”</td></tr>

I knew that Moriarty was not the only man who had sworn my death. There were at least three others whose desire for vengeance upon me would only be increased by the death of their leader. They were all most dangerous men. One or other would certainly get me. On the other hand, if all the world was convinced that I was dead they would take liberties, these men, they would lay themselves open, and sooner or later I could destroy them.

This was not literally true. A few small footholds presented themselves, and there was some indication of a ledge. The cliff is so high that to climb it all was an obvious impossibility, and it was equally impossible to make my way along the wet path without leaving some tracks. I might, it is true, have reversed my boots, as I have done on similar occasions, but the sight of three sets of tracks in one direction would certainly have suggested a deception. On the whole, then, it was best that I should risk the climb. It was not a pleasant business, Watson. The fall roared beneath me. I am not a fanciful person, but I give you my word that I seemed to hear Moriarty’s voice screaming at me out of the abyss. A mistake would have been fatal. More than once, as tufts of grass came out in my hand or my foot slipped in the wet notches of the rock, I thought that I was gone. But I struggled upwards, and at last I reached ledge several feet deep and covered with soft green moss, where I could lie unseen in the most perfect comfort. There I was stretched when you, my dear Watson, and all your following were investigating in the most sympathetic and inefficient manner the circumstances of my death.</td></tr>

For an instant I thought that it was an accident; but a moment later, looking up, I saw a man’s head against the darkening sky, and another stone struck the very ledge upon which I was stretched, within a foot of my head. Of course, the meaning of this was obvious. Moriarty had not been alone. A confederate—and even that one glance had told me how dangerous a man that confederate was—had kept guard while the Professor had attacked me. From a distance, unseen by me, he had been a witness of his friend’s death and of my escape.

		<td class="en">“I had only one confidant—my brother Mycroft. I owe you many apologies, my dear Watson, but it was all-important that it should be thought I was dead, and it is quite certain that you would not have written so convincing an account of my unhappy end had you not yourself thought that it was true. Several times during the last three years I have taken up my pen to write to you, but always I feared lest your affectionate regard for me should tempt you to some indiscretion which would betray my secret. For that reason I turned away from you this evening when you upset my books, for I was in danger at the time, and any show of surprise and emotion upon your part might have drawn attention to my identity and led to the most deplorable and irreparable results. As to Mycroft, I had to confide in him in order to obtain the money which I needed. The course of events in London did not run so well as I had hoped, for the trial of the Moriarty gang left two of its most dangerous members, my own most vindictive enemies, at liberty. I travelled for two years in Tibet, therefore, and amused myself by visiting Lhassa and spending some days with the head Llama. You may have read of the remarkable explorations of a Norwegian named Sigerson, but I am sure that it never occurred to you that you were receiving news of your friend. I then passed through Persia, looked in at Mecca, and paid a short but interesting visit to the Khalifa at Khartoum, the results of which I have communicated to the Foreign Office. Returning to France I spent some months in a research into the coal-tar derivatives, which I conducted in a laboratory at Montpelier, in the South of France. Having concluded this to my satisfaction, and learning that only one of my enemies was now left in London, I was about to return when my movements were hastened by the news of this very remarkable Park Lane Mystery, which not only appealed to me by its own merits, but which seemed to offer some most peculiar personal opportunities. I came over at once to London, called in my own person at Baker Street, threw Mrs. Hudson into violent hysterics, and found that Mycroft had preserved my rooms and my papers exactly as they had always been. So it was, my dear Watson, that at two o’clock to-day I found myself in my old arm-chair in my own old room, and only wishing that I could have seen my old friend Watson in the other chair which he has so often adorned.”</td></tr>

I knew not what wild beast we were about to hunt down in the dark jungle of criminal London, but I was well assured from the bearing of this master huntsman that the adventure was a most grave one—while the sardonic smile which occasionally broke through his ascetic gloom boded little good for the object of our quest.</td></tr>

I observed that as he stepped out he gave a most searching glance to right and left, and at every subsequent street corner he took the utmost pains to assure that he was not followed. Our route was certainly a singular one. Holmes’s knowledge of the byways of London was extraordinary, and on this occasion he passed rapidly, and with an assured step, through a network of mews and stables the very existence of which I had never known. We emerged at last into a small road, lined with old, gloomy houses, which led us into Manchester Street, and so to Blandford Street. Here he turned swiftly down a narrow passage, passed through a wooden gate into a deserted yard, and then opened with a key the back door of a house.

Here Holmes turned suddenly to the right, and we found ourselves in a large, square, empty room, heavily shadowed in the corners, but faintly lit in the centre from the lights of the street beyond.

There was no mistaking the poise of the head, the squareness of the shoulders, the sharpness of the features. The face was turned half-round, and the effect was that of one of those black silhouettes which our grandparents loved to frame. It was a perfect reproduction of Holmes.

Holmes was silent and motionless; but I could tell that he was keenly alert, and that his eyes were fixed intently upon the stream of passers-by. It was a bleak and boisterous night, and the wind whistled shrilly down the long street. Many people were moving to and fro, most of them muffled in their coats and cravats. Once or twice it seemed to me that I had seen the same figure before, and I especially noticed two men who appeared to be sheltering themselves from the wind in the doorway of a house some distance up the street. I tried to draw my companion’s attention to them, but he gave a little ejaculation of impatience and continued to stare into the street. More than once he fidgeted with his feet and tapped rapidly with his fingers upon the wall. It was evident to me that he was becoming uneasy and that his plans were not working out altogether as he had hoped. At last, as midnight approached and the street gradually cleared, he paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. I was about to make some remark to him when I raised my eyes to the lighted window and again experienced almost as great a surprise as before. I clutched Holmes’s arm and pointed upwards.</td></tr>

All was still and dark, save only that brilliant yellow screen in front of us with the black figure outlined upon its centre. Again in the utter silence I heard that thin, sibilant note which spoke of intense suppressed excitement. An instant later he pulled me back into the blackest corner of the room, and I felt his warning hand upon my lips. The fingers which clutched me were quivering. Never had I known my friend more moved, and yet the dark street still stretched lonely and motionless before us.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >突然，我察觉到了他更为敏锐的感官早已察觉的东西，听到了一阵鬼鬼祟祟的轻微声响。声音并不是来自贝克街的方向，而是来自我俩藏身的这座屋子背后。一道门打开了，跟着又关了起来。接着，过道里传来了鬼鬼祟祟的脚步声。走路的人已经尽量放轻了脚步，刺耳的声音却依然在空屋之中四处回荡。福尔摩斯缩到了墙边，我也贴紧墙壁，握住了自己的左轮手枪。昏暗之中，我看到了一个模糊的身影，一个比门口的黑暗稍微黑一点儿的影像。他在敞开的门边站了一小会儿，然后就猫着腰，气势汹汹地摸进了房间。这个邪恶的人影来到了离我俩不到三码的地方，我已经准备好了迎接他的突然袭击，跟着就意识到，他并没有察觉到我俩的存在。他与我俩擦身而过，悄无声息地走到窗边，轻手轻脚地把窗子往上抬了半英尺，没有弄出一丝声响。他伏到与窗子的开口平齐的位置，整张脸立刻暴露在不再受到尘封玻璃遮挡的街灯光线之下。看样子，这个人已经兴奋得无法自控，两只眼睛像星星一样闪闪发亮，五官也在不停地抽搐。他已经上了年纪，鼻子又细又高，额头又凸又亮，斑白的髭须十分浓密。他的折叠礼帽扣在后脑勺上，大衣敞着，露出了白亮亮的礼服衬衫前襟。他长着一张黝黑瘦削的脸，脸上刻满了野性十足的深深线条。他手里拿着一件看起来像是手杖的东西，放到地板上的时候却发出了金属的铿锵声。接着，他从大衣口袋里掏出一样尺寸不小的物事，忙忙叨叨地折腾了一阵，最后就弄出了一记清脆响亮的“咔嗒”，似乎是弹簧或者插销之类的东西就位的声音。他保持着跪在地板上的姿势，探身向前，用全身的重量和力气去压某种类似杠杆的东西，随之传来一阵长长的飕飕声和吱呀声，最后则又是一记响亮的“咔嗒”。于是，他直起身来，我这才看出他手里拿的是一支枪，枪托的形状十分古怪。只见他打开枪的后膛，把什么东西塞了进去，然后就“啪”的一声合上枪栓，伏下身子，把枪管的前端架上窗台，一只闪闪发亮的眼睛顺着枪管往前瞄，长长的髭须耷拉到了枪托上。他用肩膀顶住了枪托，我随即听见他满意地轻轻舒了口气，看到他的枪口已经对准了那个非同一般的目标，对准了黄色窗子里那个黑色的人影。他一动不动地僵在那里，片刻之后才扣动了扳机。我耳边立刻传来一记响亮的嗖嗖声，听起来十分怪异，跟着就是一阵玻璃碎裂的清脆声响[^20]。说时迟那时快，福尔摩斯一跃而起，像猛虎一般扑到射手的背上，把他扑了个嘴啃泥。那人马上爬了起来，使出抽风似的蛮劲扼住了福尔摩斯的咽喉，可我用左轮手枪的枪把冲他的脑袋招呼了一下，让他回到了地板上。我扑过去摁住了他，我朋友则掏出哨子，使劲儿地吹了一声。人行道上立刻响起了噼里啪啦的脚步声，两名穿制服的警员和一名便衣探员从屋子的前门冲进了房间。</td>
		<td class="en">But suddenly I was aware of that which his keener senses had already distinguished. A low, stealthy sound came to my ears, not from the direction of Baker Street, but from the back of the very house in which we lay concealed. A door opened and shut. An instant later steps crept down the passage—steps which were meant to be silent, but which reverberated harshly through the empty house. Holmes crouched back against the wall and I did the same, my hand closing upon the handle of my revolver. Peering through the gloom, I saw the vague outline of a man, a shade blacker than the blackness of the open door. He stood for an instant, and then he crept forward, crouching, menacing, into the room. He was within three yards of us, this sinister figure, and I had braced myself to meet his spring, before I realized that he had no idea of our presence. He passed close beside us, stole over to the window, and very softly and noiselessly raised it for half a foot. As he sank to the level of this opening the light of the street, no longer dimmed by the dusty glass, fell full upon his face. The man seemed to be beside himself with excitement. His two eyes shone like stars and his features were working convulsively. He was an elderly man, with a thin, projecting nose, a high, bald forehead, and a huge grizzled moustache. An opera-hat was pushed to the back of his head, and an evening dress shirt-front gleamed out through his open overcoat. His face was gaunt and swarthy, scored with deep, savage lines. In his hand he carried what appeared to be a stick, but as he laid it down upon the floor it gave a metallic clang. Then from the pocket of his overcoat he drew a bulky object, and he busied himself in some task which ended with a loud, sharp click, as if a spring or bolt had fallen into its place. Still kneeling upon the floor he bent forward and threw all his weight and strength upon some lever, with the result that there came a long, whirling, grinding noise, ending once more in a powerful click. He straightened himself then, and I saw that what he held in his hand was a sort of gun, with a curiously misshapen butt. He opened it at the breech, put something in, and snapped the breech-block. Then, crouching down, he rested the end of the barrel upon the ledge of the open window, and I saw his long moustache droop over the stock and his eye gleam as it peered along the sights. I heard a little sigh of satisfaction as he cuddled the butt into his shoulder, and saw that amazing target, the black man on the yellow ground, standing clear at the end of his foresight. For an instant he was rigid and motionless. Then his finger tightened on the trigger. There was a strange, loud whiz and a long, silvery tinkle of broken glass. At that instant Holmes sprang like a tiger on to the marksman’s back and hurled him flat upon his face. He was up again in a moment, and with convulsive strength he seized Holmes by the throat; but I struck him on the head with the butt of my revolver and he dropped again upon the floor. I fell upon him, and as I held him my comrade blew a shrill call upon a whistle. There was the clatter of running feet upon the pavement, and two policemen in uniform, with one plainclothes detective, rushed through the front entrance and into the room.</td></tr>

He retired, came to London, and again acquired an evil name. It was at this time that he was sought out by Professor Moriarty, to whom for a time he was chief of the staff. Moriarty supplied him liberally with money and used him only in one or two very high-class jobs which no ordinary criminal could have undertaken. You may have some recollection of the death of Mrs. Stewart, of Lauder, in 1887. Not? Well, I am sure Moran was at the bottom of it; but nothing could be proved. So cleverly was the Colonel concealed that even when the Moriarty gang was broken up we could not incriminate him. You remember at that date, when I called upon you in your rooms, how I put up the shutters for fear of air-guns? No doubt you thought me fanciful. I knew exactly what I was doing, for I knew of the existence of this remarkable gun, and I knew also that one of the best shots in the world would be behind it. When we were in Switzerland he followed us with Moriarty, and it was undoubtedly he who gave me that evil five minutes on the Reichenbach ledge.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“You may think that I read the papers with some attention during my sojourn in France, on the look-out for any chance of laying him by the heels. So long as he was free in London my life would really not have been worth living. Night and day the shadow would have been over me, and sooner or later his chance must have come. What could I do? I could not shoot him at sight, or I should myself be in the dock. There was no use appealing to a magistrate. They cannot interfere on the strength of what would appear to them to be a wild suspicion. So I could do nothing. But I watched the criminal news, knowing that sooner or later I should get him. Then came the death of this Ronald Adair. My chance had come at last! Knowing what I did, was it not certain that Colonel Moran had done it? He had played cards with the lad; he had followed him home from the club; he had shot him through the open window. There was not a doubt of it. The bullets alone are enough to put his head in a noose. I came over at once. I was seen by the sentinel, who would, I knew, direct the Colonel’s attention to my presence. He could not fail to connect my sudden return with his crime and to be terribly alarmed. I was sure that he would make an attempt to get me out of the way *at once*, and would bring round his murderous weapon for that purpose. I left him an excellent mark in the window, and, having warned the police that they might be needed—by the way, Watson, you spotted their presence in that doorway with unerring accuracy—I took up what seemed to me to be a judicious post for observation, never dreaming that he would choose the same spot for his attack. Now, my dear Watson, does anything remain for me to explain?”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“I think that it is not difficult to explain the facts. It came out in evidence that Colonel Moran and young Adair had between them won a considerable amount of money. Now, Moran undoubtedly played foul—of that I have long been aware. I believe that on the day of the murder Adair had discovered that Moran was cheating. Very likely he had spoken to him privately, and had threatened to expose him unless he voluntarily resigned his membership of the club and promised not to play cards again. It is unlikely that a youngster like Adair would at once make a hideous scandal by exposing a well-known man so much older than himself. Probably he acted as I suggest. The exclusion from his clubs would mean ruin to Moran, who lived by his ill-gotten card gains. He therefore murdered Adair, who at the time was endeavouring to work out how much money he should himself return, since he could not profit by his partner’s foul play. He locked the door lest the ladies should surprise him and insist upon knowing what he was doing with these names and coins. Will it pass?”</td></tr>
