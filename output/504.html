		<td class="en">“Well, daughter?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哎，妈妈？”那无礼粗野的女儿答道，这时从她嘴里跑出了两条毒蛇和两只癞蛤蟆。</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, mother?” answered the pert hussy, throwing out of her mouth two vipers and two toads.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦！天啊，”寡妇叫起来，“我看到了什么？</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh! mercy,” cried the mother; “what is it I see?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >啊！准是她那卑鄙的妹妹干的好事，她要为此付出代价。”说罢寡妇就跑去揍她的小女儿。</td>
		<td class="en">Oh! it is that wretch her sister who has occasioned all this; but she shall pay for it”; and immediately she ran to beat her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个可怜的孩子逃了出去，藏身于森林中，但并没有离家很远。</td>
		<td class="en">The poor child fled away from her, and went to hide herself in the forest, not far from thence.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >国王的儿子打猎归来的途中遇上了女孩，觉得她非常漂亮，便问她一个人在那里做什么，为什么哭泣。</td>
		<td class="en">The King’s son, then on his return from hunting, met her, and seeing her so very pretty, asked her what she did there alone and why she cried.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“唉，阁下，是我的妈妈将我赶了出来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Alas! sir, my mamma has turned me out of doors.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >国王的儿子看到五六颗珍珠以及差不多数量的钻石从她嘴里冒了出来，便很想她告诉自己到底发生了什么。</td>
		<td class="en">The King’s son, who saw five or six pearls and as many diamonds come out of her mouth, desired her to tell him how that happened.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是，女孩告诉了他事情的始末，王子因此而爱上了她，而且认为这样一件礼物比任何嫁妆都珍贵，他带着女孩回到了他父王的城堡，并娶她为妻。</td>
		<td class="en">She thereupon told him the whole story; and so the King’s son fell in love with her, and, considering himself that such a gift was worth more than any marriage portion, conducted her to the palace of the King his father, and there married her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >至于女孩的姐姐，她让自己变得极度令人讨厌，所以连她自己的母亲也嫌弃她，把她赶了出去。这个悲惨的可怜虫在外流浪了很久，没有人愿意收留她。她跑到树林里的某一个角落，最后死在了那里。</td>
		<td class="en">As for the sister, she made herself so much hated that her own mother turned her off; and the miserable wretch, having wandered about a good while without finding anybody to take her in, went to a corner of the wood, and there died. </td></tr>
