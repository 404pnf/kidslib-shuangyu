		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >比克内尔医生心情好极了。由于一个小事故，稍微的疏忽大意，仅此而已，一个原本可以挺过来的人在前一夜死掉了。虽然那只是一位水手，无数平民百姓中的一员，但是接收医院的管理员整个上午都如坐针毡。这并不是说那个人的死令他不舒服，他知道那医生医术高超，足以应付，但他苦恼的正是这个手术做得本是很成功的啊。作为最精细的外科手术之一，它很成功，一如它既具独创性又标新立异。所有这些当时都依赖于治疗方案、护士和管理员。可那人死了。没别的，粗心一点儿而已，但却足以使作为专业人员的比克内尔医生彻底震怒，而且也足以扰乱医务人员和护士们接下来的二十四小时的工作。</td>
		<td class="en">Doctor Bicknell was in a remarkably gracious mood.Through a minor accident, a slight bit of carelessness, that was all, a man who might have pulled through had died the preceding night.Though it had been only a sailorman, one of the innumerable unwashed, the steward of the receiving hospital had been on the anxious seat all the morning.It was not that the man had died that gave him discomfort, he knew the Doctor too well for that, but his distress lay in the fact that the operation had been done so well.One of the most delicate in surgery, it had been as successful as it was clever and audacious.All had then depended upon the treatment, the nurses, the steward.And the man had died.Nothing much, a bit of carelessness, yet enough to bring the professional wrath of Doctor Bicknell about his ears and to perturb the working of the staff and nurses for twenty-four hours to come.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，如上所述，这个医生心情却是相当地好。当管理员诚惶诚恐地告知他那个人出乎意料的死讯时，他没有说任何指责的话；不仅如此，他的双唇撅起轻柔地吹出雷格泰姆的音乐片段，直到有人高兴地询问他别家头胎孩子的健康状况时，他的口哨才被打断。管理员以为他可能没抓住这件事的关键，又重复了一遍。</td>
		<td class="en">But, as already stated, the Doctor was in a remarkably gracious mood.When informed by the steward, in fear and trembling, of the man’s unexpected take-off, his lips did not so much as form one syllable of censure; nay, they were so pursed that snatches of ragtime floated softly from them, to be broken only by a pleasant query after the health of the other’s eldest-born.The steward, deeming it impossible that he could have caught the gist of the case, repeated it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，是的，”比克内尔医生不耐烦地说，“我明白。不过森珀·艾德姆怎么样了？他准备要离开吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, yes,” Doctor Bicknell said impatiently; “I understand.But how about Semper Idem?Is he ready to leave?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的。他们现在正帮他穿衣服。”管理员回答着，继续履行着他的职责，很满意平静依然笼罩着这个充满碘酒气味的房间。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes.They’re helping him dress now,” the steward answered, passing on to the round of his duties, content that peace still reigned within the iodine-saturated walls.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >正是森珀·艾德姆的康复完全抵消了比克内尔医生因那个水手的死亡而感到的缺憾。生命对他来说只不过是病例，是这行业中令人不快却又不可避免的意外，但是病例，啊，病例就是一切。认识他的人们倾向于把他看作屠夫，但他的同事一致认为手术台前再没比他更大胆、更有能力的人了。他不是一个富有想象力的人。他不具有情感，因而也就不能容忍情感。他生性细致、认真、严谨。人对于他来说不过是走卒，没有个体特征或是个人价值。但是作为病例来讲却是不同的。一个人伤得越重，他的生命越不稳定，那他在比克内尔医生眼里就越重要。他会欣然舍弃一个遭遇小事故的桂冠诗人而去救治一个伤势严重的无名流浪汉，流浪汉靠拒绝死亡来藐视生活法则，这就像一个孩子会为了看马戏而放弃喜爱的《庞奇和朱迪》这样的木偶剧。</td>
		<td class="en">It was Semper Idem’s recovery which had so fully compensated Doctor Bicknell for the loss of the sailorman.Lives were to him as nothing, the unpleasant but inevitable incidents of the profession, but cases, ah, cases were everything.People who knew him were prone to brand him a butcher, but his colleagues were at one in the belief that a bolder and yet a more capable man never stood over the table.He was not an imaginative man.He did not possess, and hence had no tolerance for, emotion.His nature was accurate, precise, scientific.Men were to him no more than pawns, without individuality or personal value.But as cases it was different.The more broken a man was, the more precarious his grip on life, the greater his significance in the eyes of Doctor Bicknell.He would as readily forsake a poet laureate suffering from a common accident for a nameless, mangled vagrant who defied every law of life by refusing to die, as would a child forsake a Punch and Judy for a circus.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因此这就体现在了森珀·艾德姆的病例中。这个人的神秘并没有引起他的兴趣，他的沉默不语和小报记者们在潜水员周日版里耸人听闻、徒然地渲染他那加以掩饰的风流韵事也没有能打动他。但是森珀·艾德姆的喉咙被割断了。那是核心问题。那是他的兴趣之所在。从左耳切到右耳，千分之一的外科医师都不敢染指此事，都觉得他没有康复的可能。但是，多亏了迅速的市政救护车服务和比克内尔医生，他才被拽回到了他已设法要离开的世界。当病人被带进来时，这位医生的同事们都摇了摇头。没救了，他们说。喉咙、气管、颈静脉，确实都伤得很重，失血量也极大。这是一个意料中的必然结局，所以比克内尔医生所采取的手段以及所做的事情让他们觉得不寒而栗，纵然那些都是他们业务范围内的。瞧！该男子已康复了。</td>
		<td class="en">So it had been in the case of Semper Idem.The mystery of the man I had not appealed to him, nor had his silence and the veiled romance which the yellow reporters had so sensationally and so fruitlessly exploitted in divers Sunday editions.But Semper Idem’s throat had been cut.That was the point.That was where his interest had centred.Cut from ear to ear, and not one surgeon in a thousand to give a snap of the fingers for his chance of recovery.But, thanks to the swift municipal ambulance service and to Doctor Bicknell, he had been dragged back into the world he had sought to leave.The Doctor’s co-workers had shaken their heads when the case was brought in.Impossible, they said.Throat, windpipe, jugular, all but actually severed, and the loss of blood frightful.As it was such a foregone conclusion, Doctor Bicknell had employed methods and done things which made them, even in their professional capacities, to shudder.And lo! the man had recovered.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >因此，在恢复了健康且精力充沛的森珀·艾德姆即将出院的这个早上，管事的报告并没有扰乱比克内尔医生温和的性情，他欢快地继续发出命令救治一个孩子，这个孩子被电车的车轮碰倒在地轧了过去，现场一片混乱。</td>
		<td class="en">So, on this morning that Semper Idem was to leave the hospital, hale and hearty, Doctor Bicknell’s geniality was in nowise disturbed by the steward’s report, and he proceeded cheerfully to bring order out of the chaos of a child’s body which had been ground and crunched beneath the wheels of an electric car.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >正如很多人将记得的那样，森珀·艾德姆的病例引起了人们很大的好奇心，这种好奇虽不太适宜却极为自然。他是在一个贫民窟出租房里被发现的，正如前面提到过的，他的喉咙被割断了，鲜血直流，滴落在下层房间里的住户们身上，打断了他们的庆祝活动。他显然是站着做这事的，头向前低着，这样他或许能最后看一眼竖立在桌子上的照片，这张照片靠在一个蜡烛架上。就是这种姿势使得比克内尔医生有可能去挽救他。剃须刀这一掠力道如此之大，以至于他猛地往后仰起头，一切正如他所做过的一样，他十分恰当地完成这一动作，脖子伸长，弹性的血管壁肿胀着，这样他将很有可能结束自己的生命了。</td>
		<td class="en">As many will remember, the case of Semper Idem aroused a vast deal of unseemly yet highly natural curiosity.He had been found in a slum lodging, with throat cut as aforementioned, and blood dripping down upon the inmates of the room below and disturbing their festivities.He had evidently done the deed standing, with head bowed forward that he might gaze his last upon a photograph which stood on the table propped against a candle-stick.It was this attitude which had made it possible for Doctor Bicknell to save him. So terrific had been the sweep of the razor that had he had his head thrown back, as he should have done to have accomplished the act properly, with his neck stretched and the elastic vascular walls distended, he would have of a certainty well nigh decapitated himself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在医院里，在他恢复生命的令人厌烦的整个过程中，他一个字都没有说。警方官员派遣的大侦探也没探听到任何东西。没人认识他，也没人见过他，或是以前听说过他。他刻板，与现实格格不入。他的衣服和环境都是最底层劳动者的，他的手却是一位绅士的手。但是一点儿字迹也没发现，除了一个细节可用来显示他的过去或他的生活地位。</td>
		<td class="en">At the hospital, during all the time he travelled the repugnant road back to life, not a word had left his lips.Nor could anything be learned of him by the sleuths detailed by the chief of police.Nobody knew him, nor had ever seen or heard of him before.He was strictly, uniquely of the present.His clothes and surroundings were those of the lowest laborer, his hands the hands of a gentleman.But not a shred of writing was discovered, nothing, save in one particular, which would serve to indicate his past or his position in life.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个细节就是那张照片。如果它是一幅照片，卡片架里那个直率地凝视着看客的女人真算得上是一个标致的美人。它是一个业余作品，因为令侦探们困惑的是它没有附加任何职业摄影师的签名或是工作室标志。在裱褙一角那精美花饰图案的地方，写着：“森珀·艾德姆；永远忠诚。”她看着它。就像很多人回忆的那样，这是一张让人无法忘记的面孔。照片很聪明地采用了特像网版画的那种技法，刊登在当时所有主流报纸上；但是这样的过程带来的只是难以掌控的公众好奇心和给版面作家提供了没完没了的写作素材。</td>
		<td class="en">And that one particular was the photograph.If it were at all a likeness, the woman who gazed frankly out upon the onlooker from the card-mount must have been a striking creature indeed.It was an amateur production, for the detectives were baffled in that no professional photographers signature or studio was appended.Across a corner of the mount, in delicate feminine tracery, was written: “Semper idem; semper fidelis.”And she looked it.As many recollect, it was a face one could never forget.Clever half-tones, remarkably like, were published in all the leading papers at the time; but such procedure gave rise to nothing but the uncontrollable public curiosity and interminable copy to the space-writers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >由于没有更好的名字，医院工作人员和外面的人就称这个自杀的人为森珀·艾德姆。并且森珀·艾德姆他活了下来。记者、侦探和护士都绝望地放弃了他。从他嘴里劝不出来一个词；然而他闪烁的眼神表明他是清醒的，他的耳朵听得见，他的大脑也明白人们抛向他的每一问题。</td>
		<td class="en">For want of a better name, the rescued suicide was known to the hospital attendants, and to the world, as Semper Idem.And Semper Idem he remained.Reporters, detectives, and nurses gave him up in despair.Not one word could he be persuaded to utter; yet the flitting conscious light of his eyes showed that his ears heard and his brain grasped every question put to him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是，当比克内尔医生在办公室停下来去跟他的病人告别时，这种神秘和传奇色彩也没引起比克内尔医生的任何兴趣。他，作为一名医生，在关于这个病人的事情上扮演了一个天才，做了外科手术历史记载中几乎是前所未有的事。他不在意这个人是谁或是干什么的，而且他也根本不可能再见到他；但是，像是一个艺术家注视着一件完成了的作品一样，他希望最后再看一眼由他的手和脑所成就的作品。</td>
		<td class="en">But this mystery and romance played no part in Doctor Bicknell’s interest when he paused in the office to have a parting word with his patient.He, the Doctor, had performed a prodigy in the matter of this man, done what was virtually unprecedented in the annals of surgery.He did not care who or what the man was, and it was highly improbable that he should ever see him again; but, like the artist gazing upon a finished creation, he wished to look for the last time upon the work of his hand and brain.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >森珀·艾德姆依然沉默着。他好像急着要走。医生从他嘴里一句话也套不出来，这医生也毫不在意。他仔细检查了这个康复的人的喉咙，以父亲的那种恋恋不舍、几乎爱抚的喜爱之情扫视着那可怕的伤疤。那并不是一个让人非常开心的景象。他的喉部被人愤怒地划了一圈——简直像是他刚刚逃脱了绞索似的，并且——划痕在两侧耳朵以下的地方不见了，出现在脖颈周边红肿的地方。</td>
		<td class="en">Semper Idem still remained mute.He seemed anxious to be gone.Not a word could the Doctor extract from him, and little the Doctor cared.He examined the throat of the convalescent carefully, idling over the hideous scar with the lingering, half-caressing fondness of a parent.It was not a particularly pleasing sight.An angry line circled the throat,—for all the world as though the man had just escaped the hangman’s noose, and,—disappearing below the ear on either side, had the appearance of completing the fiery periphery at the nape of the neck.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他固执地保持着沉默，像被束缚住的狮子一样屈从于对方的检查，森珀·艾德姆流露出的只是想从公众视野中脱离出来的渴望。</td>
		<td class="en">Maintaining his dogged silence, yielding to the other’s examination in much the manner of a leashed lion, Semper Idem betrayed only his desire to drop from out of the public eye.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好吧，我就不留你了。”比克内尔医生终于说道，把手放在了这男人肩上，偷偷最后瞄了一眼自己的手艺成果。“但是让我给你点儿建议。下次你再尝试的时候，把下巴仰起来，这样。不要蜷伏下来，这样就像宰牛一样结束自己的生命了。要干净利落，你知道。干净利落。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, I’ll not keep you,” Doctor Bicknell finally said, laying a hand on the man’s shoulder and stealing a last glance at his own handiwork.“But let me give you a bit of advice.Next time you try it on, hold your chin up, so.Don’t snuggle it down and butcher yourself like a cow.Neatness and despatch, you know.Neatness and despatch.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >森珀·艾德姆的两眼闪动了一下，表明他听到了，过了一会儿，医院的门在他身后关上了。</td>
		<td class="en">Semper Idem’s eyes flashed in token that he heard, and a moment later the hospital door swung to on his heel.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对于比克内尔医生来说，这是繁忙的一天，当他点燃一根雪茄，准备离开手术台——似乎那些患者争先恐后要上的手术台时，早已是下午了。但是最后一位，一个肩胛骨受伤的捡破烂的老人却被夺去了生命，而散发着香味的香烟圈在他的头顶上缭绕，正在这时，大街上救护车的鸣笛声透过敞开的窗户传了进来，接着进来的必然是担架，还有躺在担架上苍白的病人。</td>
		<td class="en">It was a busy day for Doctor Bicknell, and the afternoon was well along when he lighted a cigar preparatory to leaving the table upon which it seemed the sufferers almost clamored to be laid.But the last one, an old rag-picker with a broken shoulder-blade, had been disposed of, and the first fragrant smoke wreaths had begun to curl about his head, when the gong of a hurrying ambulance came through the open window from the street, followed by the inevitable entry of the stretcher with its ghastly freight.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“把它放到台子上，”医生命令道，一会儿转过身把雪茄放到安全处，“什么情况？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Lay it on the table,” the Doctor directed, turning for a moment to place his cigar in safety.“What is it?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“自杀——割喉，”一个抬担架的工作人员回答，“在摩根小巷。我想，没什么希望了，先生。他快要完了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Suicide—throat cut,” responded one of the stretcher bearers “Down on Morgan Alley.Little hope, I think, sir.He’s ’most gone.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗯？好吧，不管怎样，我还是给他看一看。”他屈身俯向那个人，正在这时，伤口处的嫩肉最后一次微弱地颤动了一下，之后就不动了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Eh?Well, I’ll give him a look, anyway.”He leaned over the man at the moment when the quick made its last faint flutter and succumbed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是森珀·艾德姆又回来了。”管事说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“It’s Semper Idem come back again,” the steward said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊，”比克内尔医生答道，“又走了。这次不再笨手笨脚了。干得不错，终结了生命，这一次干得很利落。完全听取了我的建议。我没必要在这儿了。把它推向太平间。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Ay,” replied Doctor Bicknell, “and gone again.No bungling this time.Properly done, upon my life, sir, properly done.Took my advice to the letter.I’m not required here.Take it along to the morgue.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >比克内尔医生取来他的雪茄，重新点燃了。“那，”他在袅袅烟雾中看着管理员说道，“那就和昨晚你没能救活的那个人扯平了。我们现在两清了。”</td>
		<td class="en">Doctor Bicknell secured his cigar and relighted it.“That,” he said between the puffs, looking at the steward, “that evens up for the one you lost last night.We’re quits now.”</td></tr>
