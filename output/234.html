		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >九月末的时候，我回到位于英格兰中部地区的家乡呆了几天。家乡已经无家可言，因为我父母已经去世。不过几个姐妹还住在那边，除此之外，就是那个被人称作家乡的地区——那个位于诺丁汉和德比之间的矿区。</td>
		<td class="en">I came home to the Midlands for a few days, at the end of September.Not that there is any home, for my parents are dead.But there are my sisters, and the district one calls home; that mining district between Nottingham and Derby.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >回乡总会让我感到压抑。如今，我四十岁。已经快二十年了，我几乎一直在四处游荡。回到家乡，我觉得自己和这里格格不入，而且这种感觉似乎比在世界上其他任何地方都要来得更加强烈。无论是在新奥尔良的运河街、墨西哥城的马德罗大街，还是在悉尼的乔治大街、康提的特林科马利大街，亦或是在罗马、巴黎、慕尼黑，甚至是伦敦，我都能感到轻松自在。可是来到倍斯特伍德的诺丁汉路后，强烈的怀旧感立刻就会占据我的心灵，让我无限反感。一方面，我想回到那个童年时的家乡，那时候，为了在消费合作社买东西，我要等上很久，出来时总会拖着一网兜的杂货。还记得我们消费合作社的编号是1553A. L.，我记自己生日都没这么清楚。那时候，消费合作社马路对面有一小道篱笆，我常拔上面长出的绿色嫩芽，我们管它叫“面包和奶酪”。而且，当时的盖布斯街上还没有房子。女王街的拐角处住着肉贩鲍勃，这人高大肥硕、不爱说话。</td>
		<td class="en">It always depresses me to come to my native district.Now I am turned forty, and have been more or less a wanderer for nearly twenty years, I feel more alien, perhaps, in my home place than anywhere else in the world.I can feel at ease in Canal Street, New Orleans, or in the Avenue Madero, in Mexico City, or in George Street, Sydney, in Trincomalee Street, Kandy, or in Rome or Paris or Munich or even London.But in Nottingham Road, Bestwood, I feel at once a devouring nostalgia and an infinite repulsion.Partly, I want to get back to the place as it was when I was a boy, and I waited so long to be served in the Co-op—I remember our Co-op number, 1553A. L. better than the date of my birth—and when I came out lugging a string net of groceries.There was a little hedge across the road from the Co-op then, and I used to pick the green buds which we called bread-and-cheese.And there were no houses in Gabes Lane.And at the corner of Queen Street, Butcher Bob was huge and fat and taciturn.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >后来，肉贩鲍勃早早就死掉了，那个地方现在也盖满了房子。走在诺丁汉路上，我总是搞不清楚自己究竟在哪里。沃克街倒是变化不大——因为那棵白蜡树在我十六岁生病时就被砍掉了。房子依然只盖在街的一边，另一边是田野。而且，从这里我还是可以看到那块被山峰环抱的平地，尽管上面新建了几片红色的房子，还多了一抹灰暗的烟，可在我依然觉得它很美丽。克赖奇依旧屹立在西方的地平线上，安斯里森林在北面，而正前方还是康尼·格雷农场。这里的乡村依然具有某种魅力。有趣的是，街上呼啸而过的汽车、有轨电车和公共汽车越多，这乡村地带越显得与世隔绝、神秘而又难以接近。</td>
		<td class="en">Butcher Bob is long dead, and the place is all built up, I am never quite sure where I am, in Nottingham Rd. Walker Street is not very much changed though—because the ash tree was cut down when I was sixteen, when I was ill.The houses are still only on one side the street, the fields on the other.And still one looks across at the amphitheatre of hills which I still find beautiful, though there are new patches of reddish houses, and a darkening of smoke.Crich is still on the sky line to the west, and the woods of Annesley to the north, and Coney Grey Farm still lies in front.And there is still a certain glamour about the country-side.Curiously enough, the more motor-cars and tram-cars and omnibuses there are rampaging down the roads, the more the country retreats into its own isolation, and becomes more mysteriously inaccessible.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我小时候，这里所有人的生活更接近小镇生活。现在，人们在街上匆匆忙忙地跑来跑去、开车兜风或是外出远足，但他们却似乎从未触到乡村的本真。首先是因为这里的人多了不少；再者是因为所有这些新发明。</td>
		<td class="en">When I was a boy, the whole population lived very much more with the county.Now, they rush and tear along the roads, and have joy-rides and outings, but they never seem to touch the reality of the countryside.There are many more people, for one thing: and all these new contrivances, for another.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不知怎的，乡村似乎到处都是人的痕迹，却没被真正碰触过。它似乎远远地呆在后面，沉睡着，未被接近。道路都是碎石铺成的，表面很硬，已经被来往的人和车磨损了。那些田间小路看起来更宽些，走的人更多，也更脏乱。不管走到哪里，你都能感到人类的肮脏。</td>
		<td class="en">The country, seems, somehow, fogged over with people, and yet not really touched.It seems to lie back, away, unreached and asleep.The roads are hard and metalled and worn with everlasting rush.The very field-paths seem wider and more trodden and squalid.Wherever you go, there is the sordid sense of humanity.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但那些处于马路与小道间的树林田野们却深深地、沉沉地睡在梦中，和现代世界相隔断。</td>
		<td class="en">And yet the fields and the woods in between the roads and paths sleep as in a heavy, weary dream, disconnected from the modern world.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >今年九月回乡，这次旅行尤其让我沮丧。天气温暖和煦，在雾蒙蒙的、神秘且令人晕眩的天空中，没有阳光却能感到阳光的温暖，使得中部地区尤其让我害怕。我不能也无法把这种透着光亮的薄雾当作阳光，但在我出生的乡村，这种天气就算是晴天了。哦，太阳神阿波罗！您肯定把脸转过去了！</td>
		<td class="en">This visit, this September, depresses me peculiarly.The weather is soft and mild, mildly sunny in that hazed, dazed, uncanny sunless sunniness which makes the Midlands peculiarly fearsome to me.I cannot, cannot accept as sunshine this thin luminous vapourousness which passes as a fine day in the place of my birth.Oh Phoebus Apollo!Surely you have turned your face aside!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过，这次尤其让我忧愁的是煤矿工人大罢工还在进行着。一栋栋的住宅中，一个又一个的家庭现在只能靠面包、人造奶油和土豆度日。矿工们天不亮便起来，动身去乡间最后的隐秘处寻找黑莓，就好像这里曾经遭过饥荒一样。但他们却要把这辛苦得来的黑莓拿去卖，每磅四便士，这样，矿工们就能挣到四便士。</td>
		<td class="en">But the special depression this time is the great coal strike, still going on.In house after house, the families are now living on bread and margarine and potatoes.The colliers get up before dawn, and are away into the last recesses of the countryside, scouring the country for blackberries, as if there were a famine.But they will sell the blackberries at fourpence a pound, and so they’ll be fourpence in pocket.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过，我小时候，矿工摘黑莓是很不体面的。他们从不会降低自己的身份去做这种怯懦的工作。要是让一个矿工挎个小篮子走回家——他大概宁愿去杀人。小孩子们可以去摘黑莓，或是女人们，甚至少年也可以。但是结了婚的矿工汉子不会！</td>
		<td class="en">But when I was a boy, it was utterly @infra dig@, for a miner to be picking blackberries.He would never have demeaned himself to such an unmanly occupation.And as to walking home with a little basket—he would almost rather have committed murder.The children might do it, or the women, or even the half-grown youths.But a married, manly collier!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可现在，这些人把自尊装进口袋，而且这还是个破了洞的口袋。</td>
		<td class="en">But nowadays, their pride is in their pocket, and the pocket has a hole in it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >世界变了。到处都是警察，又高大又强壮，他们很奇怪，脸长得跟条羊腿似的。只有天知道他们从哪里来：大概是爱尔兰或苏格兰，因为他们不是英格兰人。而且他们成千上万地聚集在乡村周围。人们叫他们“蓝瓶子”或是“肉蝇”。而且，你会听到有女人朝街对面的另一个女人喊：“看见苍蝇飞了吗？”——然后她们就会转过去，看着那些外来的警察，尖声大笑。</td>
		<td class="en">It is another world.There are policemen everywhere, great, big strange policemen with faces like a leg of mutton.Where they come from, heaven only knows: Ireland or Scotland, presumably, for they are no Englishmen.And they exist, along the countryside, in thousands.The people call them “blue-bottles”, and “meat-flies”.And you can hear a woman call across the street to another: “Seen any blow-flies about?” —Then they turn to look at the alien policemen, and laugh shrilly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而且，这就发生在我的故乡啊！说真的，我对它已经不那么熟悉了。当我是个小孩的时候，我们有自己的警察——一个队长和两个年轻的警察。这里的女人不会把维多利亚女王叫做“蓝瓶子”，同样也不会叫梅勒队长“蓝瓶子”。梅勒队长是一个安静，又有耐心的人，他一生都在帮这里的人排忧解难。梅勒就是另一种牧羊人，而矿工们和他们的孩子就是他的羊群。这里的女人们很尊敬他。</td>
		<td class="en">And this in my native place!Truly, one no longer knows the palm of his own hand.When I was a boy, we had our own police—sergeant, and two young constables.And the women would as leave have thought of calling Sergeant Mellor a blue-bottle as calling Queen Victoria one.The Sergeant was a quiet, patient man, who spent his life trying to keep people out of trouble.He was another sort of shepherd, and the miners and their children were a flock to him.The women had the utmost respect for him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是现在，女人们似乎是变化最大的，她们不再尊敬任何东西。昨天，市集上发生了这样一件事，一位哈福顿太太和一位罗利太太因为侮辱警察和妨碍公务被带去法庭受审。当时，工贼们结束了一天所谓的工作，一位警察正护送他们下班，两个女人像往常一样在吵闹。她们俩也是来自体面人家。要在过去，被带去法庭受审，她们一定会羞愧难当。但现在，她们根本不在乎。</td>
		<td class="en">But the women seem to have changed most in this, that they have no respect for anything.There was a scene in the market-place yesterday, a Mrs Hafton and a Mrs Rowley being taken off to court to be tried for insulting and obstructing the police.The police had been escorting the black-legs from the mines, after a so-called day’s work, and the women had made the usual row.They were two women from decent homes.In the past they would have died of shame, at having to go to court.But now, not at all.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >集市上有一小群女人和她俩一起挥着红色的旗子，大声笑着，不时骂几句脏话。这里面有一个人是邮递员的老婆，原本人很体面。我认得她，她还是个小女孩时，我们就在一起玩过。但她正挥着红旗，巴士一到她就大喊大叫起来。</td>
		<td class="en">They had a little gang of women with them in the market-place, waving red flags and laughing loudly and using occasional bad language.There was one, the decent wife of the post-man.I had known her and played with her as a girl.But she was waving her red flag, and cheering as the motor-bus rolled up.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两名被告兴高采烈地起身上了车。</td>
		<td class="en">The two culprits got up, hilariously, into the bus.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“祝你好运，老丫头！让他们尝尝厉害！让打那个蓝瓶子的脖子！告诉我这是为了什么！为倍斯特伍德欢呼三声！姑娘们，趁热打铁！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Good luck, old girl!Let ’em have it!Give it the blue-bottles in the neck!Tell me what for!Three cheers for Bestwood!Strike while the iron’s hot, girls!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“再见！再见，姑娘们！待会儿见！高高兴兴回家，什么，呃？”</td>
		<td class="en">“So long!So long, girls!See you soon!Merry home-coming, what, eh?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“现在，大家好好玩吧！好好玩！高兴点！你们要是不能把他们弄到别的路上去，就拿针扎他们的肥屁股。我们会想着你们的！”“再见！再见！回见啊！谁说沃克来着！”“哦！哦！——”巴士带着两个大呼小叫的女人、在小集市上女人们嘶哑奇怪的喊叫中艰难地开走了。小集市通风很好。我母亲原来总在周五晚上带着褪了色的黑色小帽来这里买东西，现在，一群出身体面的女人在这里挥舞着小红旗，哑着嗓子为两个被带去法庭的女人欢呼加油！</td>
		<td class="en">“Have a good time, now!Have a good time!Stick a pin in their fat backsides, if you can’t move ‘em any other road.We s’ll be thinking of you!”“So long!So long!See you soon!Who says Walker!”“E-eh!E-eh!—”The bus rolled heavily off, with the shouting women, amid the strange hoarse cheering of the women in the little market-place.The draughty little market-place where my mother shopped on Friday evenings, in her rusty little black bonnet, and where now a group of decent women waved little red flags and hoarsely cheered two women going to court!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >哦妈妈咪呀！——意大利人会这么说。我亲爱的妈妈啊，要是您看到这一幕，您一定会害怕地吃惊，您的黑色小帽都会飞走的。您是那样热衷进步：做个有工作的体面的女人，还有一份优厚的薪水！您为父亲交工会会费，交了那么多年！您是那样坚定地相信合作社！您听到外祖父，那个老暴君，死讯的时候，还正在参加妇女互助会的活动！同时，您又那么坚决地相信所有的主子们、所有的上流人士终归是善良的。不管怎样，大家还是要感激他们！</td>
		<td class="en">O mamma mia!—as the Italians say.My dear mother, your little black bonnet would fly off your head in horrified astonishment, if you saw it now.You were so keen on progress: a decent working man, and a good wage! you paid my father’s union pay for him, for so many years! you believed so firmly in the Co-op! you were at your Women’s Guild when they brought you word your father, the old tyrannus, was dead!At the same time, you believed so absolutely in the ultimate benevolence of all the masters, of all the upper classes.One had to be grateful to them, after all!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >感激！您可以拥有一块蛋糕并享用它，只要这蛋糕还没吃完。等蛋糕吃完了，您还能把自己的消化不良传给下一代。哦，我亲爱的、品德高尚的母亲啊，您相信美好的乌托邦，所以您觉得自己人都不够好——就连我，被您宠坏的纤弱男孩也不例外！——哦，我亲爱的、品德高尚的母亲啊，看看我们所继承的消化不良吧，这正是因为您烤了太多的善良蛋糕！什么都不够好！我们都必须走进上流社会！上层！上层！上层！</td>
		<td class="en">Grateful!You can have your cake and eat it, while the cake lasts.When the cake comes to an end, you can hand on your indigestion.Oh my dear and virtuous mother, who believed in a Utopia of goodness, so that your own people were never quite good enough for you—not even the spoiled delicate boy, myself!—oh my dear and virtuous mother, behold the indigestion we have inherited, from the cake of perfect goodness you baked too often!Nothing was good enough!We must all rise into the upper classes!Upper!Upper!Upper!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >走到最后，靴子只剩下鞋帮，鞋底都磨烂了，我们像是走在石头路上那样疼得大叫。</td>
		<td class="en">Till at last the boots are all uppers, the sole is worn out, and we yell as we walk on stones.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我最最亲爱的母亲，您是那样的悲哀，因为您没有任何可悲哀的东西！但我们不同，我们道德和社会都得了消化不良，这会让我们胀气，然后引发上千起爆炸性的悲剧，会让我们打着嗝高喊：玩得开心点！老丫头！玩得开心！老丫头！</td>
		<td class="en">My dear, dear mother, you were so tragic, because you had nothing to be tragic about!We, on the other side, having a moral and social indigestion that would raise the wind for a thousand explosive tragedies, let off a mild crepitus ventris and shout: Have a good time, old girl!Enjoy yourself, old lass!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽不管怎么样，我们所有人都算是“出人头地”了。不到二十年前，在我母亲那个遥远的年代，善良的奖励就是“出人头地”。乖乖听话，你就能在生活中出人头地。</td>
		<td class="en">Never-the-less, we have all of us “got on”.The reward of goodness, in my mother’s far-off days, less than twenty years ago, was that you should “get on”.Be good, and you’ll get on in life.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我自己，曾经是一个矿工家流着鼻涕的小屁孩，现在，住在一栋租来的十六世纪意大利式别墅里，那建筑古老而凝重。尽管我只租了这别墅的一半——也可以肯定地说，我“出人头地”了。当我写了自己的第一本书，而且即将出版时——也就是十六年前——我母亲正在死去，一位很出名的编辑在写给她的信中提到我：“他四十岁时，就能坐上自己的四轮马车！”</td>
		<td class="en">Myself, a snotty-nosed little collier’s lad, I call myself at home when I sit in a heavy old Cinque-cento Italian villa, of which I rent only half, even then—surely I can be considered to have “got on”.When I wrote my first book, and it was going to be published—sixteen years ago—and my mother was dying, a fairly well-known editor wrote to my mother and said, of me: “By the time he is forty, he will be riding in his carriage!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我想，我母亲对此一定会边叹气边说：“唉！谁知道他能不能活到那个岁数呢！”</td>
		<td class="en">To which my mother is supposed to have said, sighing: “Ay, if he lives to be forty!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >现在我四十一岁了，所以母亲的悲叹并未言中。虽然我身体一直不好，但生命力却很旺盛。为什么大家都下定决心认为我会早死呢？也许，他们觉得我太善良了，所以活不下去。嗯，要是这样，他们可就太坏了！</td>
		<td class="en">Well, I am forty-one, so there’s one in the eye for that sighing remark.I was always weak in health, but my life was strong.Why had they all made up their minds that I was to die?Perhaps they thought I was too good to live.Well, in that case they were bad!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我四十岁的时候，连自己的汽车都没有。不过我的确驾驶着一辆双马轻便马车（我自己的）行驶在落基山西山上的小农场里（农场也是我自己的，或者说是我妻子的，不过是我挣的）。我穿着灯芯绒裤子和蓝衬衫坐在马车上，大喊：“驾！阿伦！安布罗斯！”这时我就会想起奥斯丁·哈里森的预言。哦，戴尔佛斯神谕！多多那神谕！“驾！安布罗斯！”嘭！马车颠过一块石头，松针抽打我的脸！看他四十岁时驾驶马车的样子！——技术差透了！刹车吧！</td>
		<td class="en">And when I was forty, I was not even in my own motor-car.But I did drive my own two horses in a light buggy (my own) on a little ranch (also my own, or my wife’s, through me) away on the western slope of the Rocky Mountains.And sitting in my corduroy trousers and blue shirt, calling: “Get up Aaron!Ambrose!” then I thought of Austin Harrison’s prophecy.Oh Oracle of Delphos!Oracle of Dodona!“Get up, Ambrose!”Bump! went the buggy over a rock, and the pine-needles slashed my face!See him driving in his carriage, at forty!—driving it pretty badly too!Put the brake on!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就这样，我想自己算是“出人头地”了，一个矿工家流着鼻涕的小屁孩，那时大部分女人都说：“他是个不错的孩子！”现在，她们不会再这样说了：她们是否曾经说过些什么，我很怀疑。她们已经完全把我忘记了。</td>
		<td class="en">So I suppose I’ve got on, snotty-nosed little collier’s lad, of whom most of the women said: “He’s a nice little lad!”They don’t say it now: if ever they say anything, which is doubtful.They’ve forgotten me entirely.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过，我妹妹“出人头地”的方式比我的要具体多了。她就在家乡发迹。我记忆中的第一座房子就距在布里奇区的边缘不到六英里的地方——在几排可怕的矿工住宅边上的一座，虽然我也喜欢那房子——矗立着我妹妹的新房“一座可爱的房子！”——还有她的花园：“我希望妈妈能看到花园六月时的样子！”</td>
		<td class="en">But my sister’s “getting on” is much more concrete than mine.She is almost on the spot.Within six miles of that end dwelling in The Breach, which is the house I first remember—an end house of hideous rows of miners’ dwellings, though I loved it, too—stands my sister’s new house, “a lovely house!”—and her garden: “I wish mother could see my garden in June!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那么，如果母亲真的看到了，又会怎样呢？在六月，英格兰中部地区鲜花盛开，景象很美。北方的冥后波赛芬似乎从矿井深处的冥府里偷偷溜了出来，带来了鲜花的盛放。不过，如果母亲真的死而复生，看到这开满鲜花的花园和新房子面朝花园开着的玻璃门，又会怎么样呢？她那时会说：这就够了！一切都圆满了！</td>
		<td class="en">And if my mother did see it, what then?It is wonderful the flowers that bloom in these Midlands, in June.A northern Persephone seems to steal out from the Plutonic, coal-mining depths and give a real hoot of blossoms.But if my mother did return from the dead, and see that garden in full bloom, and the glass doors open from the hall of the new house, what then?Would she then say: It is reached!Consummaturn est!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在耶稣死去时，他喊道：完成了！一切都圆满了！但一切真的圆满了吗？如果是这样的话，是什么？究竟是什么圆满了？</td>
		<td class="en">When Jesus gave up the ghost, he cried: It is finished!Consummaturn est!But was it?And if so, what?What was it that was consummate?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >同样，战前我在德国看到报纸上一则胡须提升器的广告，说是只要晚上把它绑在胡子上，就能保证胡子直立，就像德皇威廉二世那不朽的胡须一样，这位皇帝的胡须本身便是不朽之物。这种胡须提升器被称为：完美！意思是：达到了！圆满了！</td>
		<td class="en">Likewise, before the war, in Germany I used to see advertised in the newspapers a moustache-lifter, which you tied on at night and it would make your moustache stay turned up, like the immortal moustache of Kaiser Wilhelm II, whose moustache alone is immortal.This moustache-lifter was called: Es ist erreicht!In other words: It is reached!Consummatum est!</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Was it?Was it reached?With the moustache lifter?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那么，我母亲的灵魂就在我妹妹的花园里。每次到那里我总能看到她，无论是在我低头观赏堇菜还是抬头望向杏树时。真的是一棵杏树！而且，我总是问那头发花白、善良的小幽灵：“亲爱的，这里怎么样？您有什么结论？”</td>
		<td class="en">So the ghost of my mother, in my sister’s garden.I see it each time I am there, bending over the violas, or looking up at the almond tree.Actually an almond tree!And I always ask, of the grey-haired, good little ghost: “Well what of it, my dear?What is the verdict?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但她从不回答，尽管我逼她说：“亲爱的母亲，看看这座房子！一定要看看门里那铺着瓷砖的大厅、墨西哥地毯和威尼斯铜器，再透过敞开的门，看看长满百合和康乃馨的草坪！看看吧！还要看看我，看我是不是一位绅士！说呀，说我几乎进入了上流社会！”但这亲爱的小幽灵从不说一个字。</td>
		<td class="en">But she never answers, though I press her: “Do look at the house, my dear!Do look at the tiled hall, and the rug from Mexico, and the brass from Venice, seen through the open doors, beyond the lilies and the carnations of the lawn beds!Do look!And do look at me, and see if I’m not a gentleman!Do say that I’m almost upper class!”But the dear little ghost says never a word.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“说呀，说我们出人头地了！说呀，说我们达到了目标。说呀，说我们到了，一切圆满了！”可这个小幽灵却转过身去，她知道我在逗她。她看了我一眼，那种眼神我明白，她在说：“我不会告诉你的，这样你就不能笑我了。你必须为自己找到答案。”然后她就溜走了，回到她的世界，不管那世界在哪里——“我父亲家里有很多房子。如果不是这样，我早就告诉你了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Do say we’ve got on!Do say, we’ve arrived.Do Say, it is reached, es ist erreicht, consummatum est!”But the tittle ghost turns aside, she knows I am teasing her.She gives me one look, which is a look I know, and which says: “I shan’t tell you, so you can’t laugh at me.You must find out for yourself.”And she steals away, to her place, wherever it may be—“In my father’s house are many mansions.If it were not so, I would have told you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >花园尽头，是一些被风摧残的小树，小树那边是青石板铺的屋顶。青石板下依旧是发黑的砖房的黑屋顶，一直都是这样。燃烧的煤矿井口散发出的一样的硫磺味。煤灰在白色的堇菜上飞扬着。机器发出刺耳的响声。冥后波赛芬逃不出地狱，于是春天也只从她那里溜到了矿井巷道。</td>
		<td class="en">The black slate roofs beyond the wind-worn young trees at the end of the garden are the same thick layers of black roofs of blackened brick houses, as ever.There is the same smell of sulphur from the burning pit bank.Smuts fly on the white violas.There is a harsh sound of machinery.Persephone couldn’t quite get out of hell, so she let spring fall from her lap along the upper workings.</td></tr>
