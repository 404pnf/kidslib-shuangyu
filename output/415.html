		<td class="en">There will be no milk left for our father and mother.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但科安也和塞坎一样，没法阻止汁液从科蒙戈树里流出来。很快，汁液就穿过小屋，向山下他们父母劳作的田野流去。</td>
		<td class="en"> But Koane could not stop it any more than Thakane, and soon the milk was flowing through the hut downhill towards their parents in the fields below.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >男人看到远处一股白色的液体像河流般涌下来，猜到发生了什么事。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是他们两人扔下锄头，急匆匆地赶到科蒙戈树旁边。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >男人和他的妻子跪在草地上，双手作杯，掬起汁液喝了起来。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >为什么科蒙戈树的汁液流向了我们的田野，而不是留在花园中？”</td>
		<td class="en">Why did Koumongoe come to us in the fields instead of staying in the garden?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是科安的错，”塞坎答道，</td>
		<td class="en">‘It was Koane’s fault,’ answered Thakane.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他喝不到科蒙戈树的汁液就不愿意去放牛。</td>
		<td class="en">‘He would not take the cattle to feed until he drank some of the milk from Koumongoe.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我不知道我还能怎么办，所以我只好给了他科蒙戈树的汁液。”</td>
		<td class="en">So, as I did not know what else to do, I gave it to him.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >父亲听了塞坎的话，但没有回答。</td>
		<td class="en">The father listened to Thakane’s words, but made no answer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他走了出去，拿进来两张羊皮。他把羊皮染成红色，并叫来铁匠打了一些铁环。</td>
		<td class="en">Instead, he went outside and brought in two sheepskins, which he stained red and sent for a blacksmith to forge some iron rings.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后他把这些铁环穿到塞坎的胳膊、腿和脖子上，然后再把羊皮一前一后地系在她身上。</td>
		<td class="en">The rings were then passed over Thakane’s arms and legs and neck, and the skins fastened on her before and behind.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是为什么要这样做呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘But why?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“因为她喝了不该喝的东西。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她碰了这棵神圣的树，而这棵树是专属于我和她母亲的。”</td>
		<td class="en">She has touched the sacred tree which belongs to her mother and me alone.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后他转过身去，让塞坎跟着他，他们沿着小路走下去，小路通往一个食人魔的住处。</td>
		<td class="en"> And, turning his back, he called to Thakane to follow him, and they went down the road which led to the dwelling of an ogre.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">I gave Koumongoe to Koane, Koumongoe to the keeper of beasts; For without Koumongoe they could not go to the meadows: Without Koumongoe they would starve in the hut; That was why I gave him the Koumongoe of my father.</td></tr>
