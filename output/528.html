		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在布列塔尼这片曾被叫做康沃尔的古老土地上，住着一位名叫巴贝尔·布里的妇女。她把所有的时间和精力都放在照看农场上。侄女泰法妮一直在她那里帮忙。</td>
		<td class="en">In the old land of Brittany, once called Cornwall, there lived a woman named Barbaik Bourhis, who spent all her days in looking after her farm with the help of her niece Tephany.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她们俩一天到晚不是在田地里就是在牛奶房里，挤牛奶、制黄油、喂家禽……她俩自己没日没夜地干活，也时刻监督着身边的人努力干活。</td>
		<td class="en">Early and late the two might be seen in the fields or in the dairy, milking cows, making butter, feeding fowls; working hard themselves and taking care that others worked too.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果巴尔贝还有点儿时间来休息或者想点儿其他事情的话，情况可能会稍好些，可她并没有。这样一来，没过多久，她就深深地爱上了钱这个东西，而且她只舍得把钱花在她和泰法妮的生活必需品上，例如食物和衣服。</td>
		<td class="en">Perhaps it might have been better for Barbaik if she had left herself a little time to rest and to think about other things, for soon she grew to love money for its own sake, and only gave herself and Tephany the food and clothes they absolutely needed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >正因为巴尔贝迷恋金钱，致使她极度厌恶那些穷人，甚至还常说这样懒惰的家伙活在世上毫无用处。</td>
		<td class="en">And as for poor people she positively hated them, and declared that such lazy creatures had no business in the world.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >巴尔贝其实就是这样的人。因此，我们可以轻易地想象出，当她发现泰法妮居然在牛舍外和那个一无所有的穷鬼丹尼斯聊天时，她是多么怒不可遏。要知道，那个丹尼斯不过是养鸟场雇的一个日工而已。</td>
		<td class="en">Well, this being the sort of person Barbaik was, it is easy to guess at her anger when one day she found Tephany talking outside the cowhouse to young Denis, who was nothing more than a day labourer from the village of Plover.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >巴尔贝一把抓住了侄女的胳膊，猛地把她拽走，嘴里还大声叫嚷着：</td>
		<td class="en">Seizing her niece by the arm, she pulled her sharply away, exclaiming:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你把时间浪费在这种人身上，难道不觉得羞耻吗？他是个一无所有的穷鬼。而你呢，有一打的人排着队要给你买银戒指，要是你愿意的话，他们高兴还来不及。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Are you not ashamed, girl, to waste your time over a man who is as poor as a rat, when there are a dozen more who would be only too happy to buy you rings of silver, if you would let them?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你也知道的，丹尼斯工作很卖力，”泰法妮反驳道，气得满脸通红，“他正在攒钱，再过不久就能自己开个农场了。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Denis is a good workman, as you know very well,’ answered Tephany, red with anger, ‘and he puts by money too, and soon he will be able to take a farm for himself.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“鬼话连篇！”巴尔贝叫道，“他开农场，等到一百岁吧。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Nonsense,’ cried Barbaik, ‘he will never save enough for a farm till he is a hundred.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >像他这种穷得掉渣的人，你还没成为他老婆，他就先去坟墓里了。”</td>
		<td class="en">I would sooner see you in your grave than the wife of a man who carries his whole fortune on his back.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“当一个人年轻力壮的时候，有没有钱又有什么关系？”泰法妮反问道。但是姑妈对她的这番话愤怒不已，岂能容许她说完！</td>
		<td class="en">‘What does fortune matter when one is young and strong?’ asked Tephany, but her aunt, amazed at such words, would hardly let her finish.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“有没有钱又有什么关系？”巴尔贝震惊地重复道，怎么也不敢相信泰法妮居然说出这种话来，</td>
		<td class="en">‘What does fortune matter?’ repeated Barbaik, in a shocked voice.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你怎么会真的蠢到瞧不起钱？</td>
		<td class="en">‘Is it possible that you are really so foolish as to despise money?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果真是丹尼斯把你教坏的，你以后不准和他说半句话。他要是再胆敢来见你，我立马把他赶出农场。</td>
		<td class="en">If this is what you learn from Denis, I forbid you to speak to him, and I will have him turned out of the farm if he dares to show his face here again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >先给我去把衣服洗好晾干。”</td>
		<td class="en">Now go and wash the clothes and spread them out to dry.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >泰法妮压根儿不敢违抗姑妈的命令，只得朝小溪边走去，但内心无比沉重，心烦意乱。</td>
		<td class="en">Tephany did not dare to disobey, but with a heavy heart went down the path to the river.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“她简直比这些石头还顽固，”泰法妮自言自语着，“是的，比石头还要顽固一千倍。</td>
		<td class="en">‘She is harder than these rocks,’ said the girl to herself, ‘yes, a thousand times harder.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >至少滴水最后可以穿石，但是她呢，不管我如何哭泣如何央求，她都毫不理睬，更别说让她改变主意了。</td>
		<td class="en">For the rain at least can at last wear away the stone, but you might cry for ever, and she would never care.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如今，和丹尼斯聊天已经是我唯一的乐趣了，倘若再也不能见他，这和让我去修道院有什么区别？”</td>
		<td class="en">Talking to Denis is the only pleasure I have, and if I am not to see him I may as well enter a convent.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她边想着边来到了岸边，正准备打开那个大亚麻布袋，里面装满了要洗的衣服。</td>
		<td class="en">Thinking these thoughts she reached the bank, and began to unfold the large packet of linen that had to be washed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就在这时，她听到了一阵“咚咚咚”的棍子敲地声。抬头一看，她面前站着一位自己并不认识的瘦小老妇。</td>
		<td class="en">The tap of a stick made her look up, and standing before her she saw a little old woman, whose face was strange to her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“老奶奶，您要坐下来休息一下吗？”泰法妮问道，把自己的布袋推到了旁边，给老人留出了位置。</td>
		<td class="en">‘You would like to sit down and rest, granny?’ asked Tephany, pushing aside her bundle.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“当一个人以天为被，以地为席时，不管在哪里都是可以休息的。”老妇人颤声答道。</td>
		<td class="en">‘When the sky is all the roof you have, you rest where you will,’ replied the old woman in trembling tones.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您这样难道不孤单吗？”泰法妮满是同情，</td>
		<td class="en">‘Are you so lonely, then?’ inquired Tephany, full of pity.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您朋友都不愿意收留您？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Have you no friends who would welcome you into their houses?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >老妇人摇了摇头。</td>
		<td class="en">The old woman shook her head.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他们很久很久以前就死了，”她接着说，“现在我唯一的朋友就是那些善良的陌生人。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘They all died long, long ago,’ she answered, ‘and the only friends I have are strangers with kind hearts.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >泰法妮沉默了一会儿，然后拿出了她本留作晚饭的小面包和培根。</td>
		<td class="en">The girl did not speak for a moment, then held out the small loaf and some bacon intended for her dinner.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这些拿去吃吧，”泰法妮对老妇说，“今天你无论如何都得好好吃一顿。”老妇人接过食物，一直看着泰法妮。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Take this,’ she said; ‘to-day at any rate you shall dine well,’ and the old woman took it, gazing at Tephany the while.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那些帮助别人的人也该得到别人的帮助，”老妇说着，“你眼睛还红红的，因为那个守财奴巴尔贝不让你和养鸟场的那位年轻人说话。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Those who help others deserve to be helped,’ she answered; ‘your eyes are still red because that miser Barbaik has forbidden you to speak to the young man from Plover.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是振作起来，你是个好女孩，我会给你一样东西，可以让你每天都能见他一次。”</td>
		<td class="en">But cheer up, you are a good girl, and I will give you something that will enable you to see him once every day.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你？”泰法妮喊道，她很震惊面前这个老妇怎么会知道她这么多事情。老妇并没听到她的嘀咕。</td>
		<td class="en">‘You?’ cried Tephany, stupefied at discovering that the beggar knew all about her affairs, but the old woman did not hear her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“拿着这个长铜片，”她接着说，“你只要把它贴在衣服上，巴尔贝就会被赶到屋子外面去数她的卷心菜。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Take this long copper pin,’ she went on, ‘and every time you stick it in your dress Mother Bourhis will be obliged to leave the house in order to go and count her cabbages.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >只要铜片还在你衣服上，你都是自由的，直到你把它放回盒子里，你姑妈才会回来。”</td>
		<td class="en">As long as the pin is in your dress you will be free, and your aunt will not come back until you have put it in its case again.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >语毕，她站起来，朝泰法妮点了点头，便消失不见了。</td>
		<td class="en"> Then, rising, she nodded to Tephany and vanished.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >泰法妮像块石头似的站在那里一动不动。</td>
		<td class="en">The girl stood where she was, as still as a stone.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果不是现在手上还拿着铜片，她真的以为自己是在做梦。</td>
		<td class="en">If it had not been for the pin in her hands she would have thought she was dreaming.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是看到老妇人给的铜片，泰法妮知道那并不是个普通的老妇，而是一个能够预知未来的神仙。</td>
		<td class="en">But by that token she knew it was no common old woman who had given it to her, but a fairy, wise in telling what would happen in the days to come.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >泰法妮突然想起来那堆衣服还没洗，便抓紧时间洗，想把和老妇人交谈的那会儿时间补回去。</td>
		<td class="en">Then suddenly Tephany’s eyes fell on the clothes, and to make up for lost time she began to wash them with great vigour.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二天晚上，就在平时丹尼斯在牛舍附近等她的那个时间点，泰法妮将铜片贴到了衣服上。就在那一瞬间，巴尔贝居然真的拿起了她的木屐，穿过果园和田野，来到了种卷心菜的地方。</td>
		<td class="en">Next evening, at the moment when Denis was accustomed to wait for her in the shadow of the cowhouse, Tephany stuck the pin in her dress, and at the very same instant Barbaik took up her sabots or wooden shoes and went through the orchard and past to the fields, to the plot where the cabbages grew.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >泰法妮脚步轻盈、心情愉悦地从房里跑出来，开心地和丹尼斯呆了很久。</td>
		<td class="en">With a heart as light as her footsteps, the girl ran from the house, and spent her evening happily with Denis.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们已经很多天没有见面了，自从上次的事情之后，这还是他们第一次见面。</td>
		<td class="en">And so it was for many days after that.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就这样，他们一直在铜片的帮助下约会。然而，渐渐地，泰法妮注意到了一些事情，令她担忧起来。</td>
		<td class="en">Then, at last, Tephany began to notice something, and the something made her very sad.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >起初，他们两个都觉得彼此在一起的时间过得飞快。但是当丹尼斯把所有他会的歌都教给了泰法妮，也告诉了她他想要变成一个成功的有钱人的雄心壮志和所有计划之后，就没有什么能跟她说的了。丹尼斯像大多数人一样，总是滔滔不绝地谈论他自己，而不愿意倾听他人之事。</td>
		<td class="en">At first, Denis seemed to find the hours that they were together fly as quickly as she did, but when he had taught her all the songs he knew, and told her all the plans he had made for growing rich and a great man, he had nothing more to say to her, for he, like a great many other people, was fond of talking himself, but not of listening to any one else.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有时候，他甚至根本不来赴约，而是在第二晚向泰法妮解释他昨晚被逼着去镇里出差了。虽然泰法妮并没有指责他，但她也不再相信他的谎话了，她很清楚丹尼斯已经不像从前那么关心她了。</td>
		<td class="en">Sometimes, indeed, he never came at all, and the next evening he would tell Tephany that he had been forced to go into the town on business, but though she never reproached him she was not deceived and saw plainly that he no longer cared for her as he used to do.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >时间一天天过去，泰法妮心情越来越沉重，脸色也越来越苍白。有一晚，泰法妮痴痴地等着丹尼斯来赴约，无奈等待无果。她把水壶放在肩膀上，朝小溪慢慢走去。</td>
		<td class="en">Day by day her heart grew heavier and her cheeks paler, and one evening, when she had waited for him in vain, she put her water-pot on her shoulder and went slowly down to the spring.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >路上，泰法妮又碰到了那位赠予她铜片的神仙，她此刻正站在泰法妮面前。老妇像个孩子般淘气地笑了笑，看了泰法妮一眼，说：</td>
		<td class="en">On the path in front of her stood the fairy who had given her the pin, and as she glanced at Tephany she gave a little mischievous laugh and said:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，看看我美丽的女孩，只有看到她喜欢的男孩，她才会开心。可是，为什么她看上去一点儿都没有比从前快乐呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Why, my pretty maiden hardly looks happier than she did before, in spite of meeting her lover whenever she pleases.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他已经厌倦我了，”泰法妮用略带颤抖的声音答道，“他总是找借口躲着我。</td>
		<td class="en">‘He has grown tired of me,’ answered Tephany in a trembling voice, ‘and he makes excuses to stay away.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对了！亲爱的奶奶，仅仅让我与他见面，是远远不够的。我一定要能逗他开心，让他愿意和我呆在一起。</td>
		<td class="en">Ah! granny dear, it is not enough to be able to see him, I must be able to amuse him and to keep him with me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >您知道的，他很聪明。</td>
		<td class="en">He is so clever, you know.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >所以，也请把我变聪明吧！”</td>
		<td class="en">Help me to be clever too.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这就是你想要的吗？”老妇问她,</td>
		<td class="en">‘Is that what you want?’ cried the old woman.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那好吧，把这片羽毛拿去粘在你的头发上，你就会变得如同所罗门一样聪明。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Well, take this feather and stick it in your hair, and you will be as wise as Solomon himself.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >泰法妮心情大好，回到家里就把羽毛粘在了蓝丝带上。那里的女孩头上都会戴着蓝丝带。</td>
		<td class="en">Blushing with pleasure Tephany went home and stuck the feather into the blue ribbon which girls always wear in that part of the country.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >过了一会儿，她听到丹尼斯欢乐地吹着口哨，发现姑妈也正在数卷心菜。正是好机会，于是她迫不及待地去见丹尼斯了。</td>
		<td class="en">In a moment she heard Denis whistling gaily, and as her aunt was safely counting her cabbages, she hurried out to meet him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >泰法妮的巨大变化让丹尼斯目瞪口呆，哑口无言。</td>
		<td class="en">The young man was struck dumb by her talk.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >似乎没有什么事情是她不知道的，歌曲也是，她会唱布列塔尼不同地方的所有歌。不仅如此，她甚至可以自己创作歌曲。</td>
		<td class="en">There was nothing that she did not seem to know, and as for songs she not only could sing those from every part of Brittany, but could compose them herself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >丹尼斯疑惑着，这还是他从前认识的那个安静的女孩吗？曾经的她可是如此急切地渴望学习所有自己能教她的东西。难道这根本就是另一个人？</td>
		<td class="en">Was this really the quiet girl who had been so anxious to learn all he could teach her, or was it somebody else?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >也许她是突然发疯了，又或者有个恶魔正在她身体里作祟。</td>
		<td class="en">Perhaps she had gone suddenly mad, and there was an evil spirit inside her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是不管怎样，他每晚回去之后，都发现泰法妮变得越来越聪明了。</td>
		<td class="en">But in any case, night after night he came back, only to find her growing wiser and wiser.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >没多久，邻居们也发现了此事，他们十分惊讶，纷纷在背地里讨论起来。因为泰法妮穿得寒碜而瞧不起她的那些人说了她不少闲话，他们时常纳闷儿：泰法妮为什么老把羽毛贴在蓝丝带上？泰法妮也“不甘示弱”，拿其中很多人开玩笑，以示捉弄。</td>
		<td class="en">Soon the neighbours whispered their surprise among themselves, for Tephany had not been able to resist the pleasure of putting the feather in her hair for some of the people who despised her for her poor clothes, and many were the jokes she made about them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当然，那些人也都听说了泰法妮对他们的嘲笑，摇着头叹息道：</td>
		<td class="en">Of course they heard of her jests, and shook their heads saying:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“她就是个心地不良的人，娶了她的男人会发现什么事情都要由她掌权指挥，都得听她的。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘She is an ill-natured little cat, and the man that marries her will find that it is she who will hold the reins and drive the horse.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >没过多久，丹尼斯也开始同意他们的观点了。他是个不管走到哪里都想要当头儿的人，对于泰法妮尖酸刻薄的说话方式，他也畏惧了。以前，当泰法妮取笑别人时，他也总在那里一起嘲笑他们。现在，当遇到这种事情，他会满脸通红，感到浑身不自在，心里暗暗担心可能下次就该轮到他遭殃了。</td>
		<td class="en">It was not long before Denis began to agree with them, and as he always liked to be master wherever he went, he became afraid of Tephany’s sharp tongue, and instead of laughing as before when she made fun of other people he grew red and uncomfortable, thinking that his turn would come next.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >类似的事情还在继续，直到有一晚，丹尼斯告诉泰法妮他真的得走了，因为他已经答应了要去邻村参加舞会。</td>
		<td class="en">So matters went on till one evening Denis told Tephany that he really could not stay a moment, as he had promised to go to a dance that was to be held in the next village.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >泰法妮的脸拉得老长，不悦之情显而易见。她辛辛苦苦工作了一整天，无时无刻不在盼着能和丹尼斯呆在一起，享受那段甜蜜安静的时光。</td>
		<td class="en">Tephany’s face fell; she had worked hard all day, and had been counting on a quiet hour with Denis.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她尽了全力想说服丹尼斯留在她身边，但是丹尼斯根本不听。说到最后，泰法妮也发怒了。</td>
		<td class="en">She did her best to persuade him to remain with her, but he would not listen, and at last she grew angry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我知道你为什么生怕错过这个舞会了，”她说，“因为派内如的阿齐莉耶也会去。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Oh, I know why you are so anxious not to miss the dance,’ she said; ‘it is because Aziliez of Pennenru will be there.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >阿齐莉耶是方圆几英里内最可爱的女孩，她和丹尼斯从小就认识。</td>
		<td class="en">Now Aziliez was the loveliest girl for miles round, and she and Denis had known each other from childhood.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，的确如此，阿齐莉耶也会去，”丹尼斯回答，他看到泰法妮这样一个聪明绝顶的人居然也会嫉妒别人，心里反倒很开心，“不管要走多远的路去看她跳舞，人们自然都乐意得很。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Oh yes, Aziliez will be there,’ answered Denis, who was quite pleased to see her jealous, ‘and naturally one would go a long way to watch her dance.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那你去呀！”泰法妮哭着跑进房里，砰的一声关上了门。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Go then!’ cried Tephany, and entering the house she slammed the door behind her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她在火堆旁坐下，绝望地盯着那红色的余烬，孤单和痛苦不断袭来。</td>
		<td class="en">Lonely and miserable she sat down by the fire and stared into the red embers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她一把扯下了粘在头发上的羽毛，抱头痛哭。</td>
		<td class="en">Then, flinging the feather from her hair, she put her head on her hands, and sobbed passionately.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“再聪明又有什么用？男人只喜欢美丽的女人。</td>
		<td class="en">‘What is the use of being clever when it is beauty that men want?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >美貌才是我需要的。</td>
		<td class="en">That is what I ought to have asked for.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是现在一切都太晚了，丹尼斯再也不会回来了。”</td>
		<td class="en">But it is too late, Denis will never come back.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“既然你这么想要美貌，那我就给你美貌。”一个声音在她身旁响起。泰法妮回头一看，那老妇正倚着她的拐杖。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Since you wish it so much you shall have beauty,’ said a voice at her side, and looking round she beheld the old woman leaning on her stick.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“把这条项链戴在你的脖子上，只要戴上这条项链，你就是世上最美丽的女人了。”老妇接着说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Fasten this necklace round your neck, and as long as you wear it you will be the most beautiful woman in the world,’ continued the fairy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >泰法妮兴奋地尖叫了起来，她接过项链，佩戴完毕，立刻冲到角落里照起了镜子。</td>
		<td class="en">With a little shriek of joy Tephany took the necklace, and snapping the clasp ran to the mirror which hung in the corner.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这回，她什么女孩子都不用怕了，当然也包括阿齐莉耶，因为绝对没有人能像她那么白皙靓丽。</td>
		<td class="en">Ah, this time she was not afraid of Aziliez or of any other girl, for surely none could be as fair and white as she.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >看着镜子中如此美艳动人的自己，她忽然起了一个念头，然后连忙穿上了她最漂亮的衣服，扣好鞋子后就匆匆赶去舞会。</td>
		<td class="en">And with the sight of her face a thought came to her, and putting on hastily her best dress and her buckled shoes she hurried off to the dance.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在路上，她看到了一辆漂亮的马车，里面坐着一位年轻男子。</td>
		<td class="en">On the way she met a beautiful carriage with a young man seated in it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >泰法妮朝他走去。“多么美丽动人的姑娘啊！”他惊叹不已，</td>
		<td class="en">‘What a lovely maiden!’ he exclaimed, as Tephany approached.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“在我的国家怎么就没有像她这样美貌的姑娘呢？</td>
		<td class="en">‘Why, there is not a girl in my own country that can be compared to her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >除了她，没有人能成为我的新娘。”</td>
		<td class="en">She, and no other, shall be my bride.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >马车很大，把那条小路都堵住了，所以泰法妮不得不留在原地，尽管她其实非常不情愿。</td>
		<td class="en">The carriage was large and barred the narrow road, so Tephany was forced, much against her will, to remain where she was.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >泰法妮直勾勾地瞪着他的脸，回答道：</td>
		<td class="en">But she looked the young man full in the face as she answered:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你走吧，贵族老爷，也请放我离开。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Go your way, noble lord, and let me go mine.</td></tr>
