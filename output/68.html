		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >燕西·戈锐律师事务所里最不体面的就是戈锐他自己了，此刻他正懒散地躺在他吱吱作响的旧扶手椅里。这间摇摇欲坠的用红砖建成的小事务所，与贝塞尔镇的主街齐平。</td>
		<td class="en">The most disreputable thing in Yancey Goree’s law office was Goree himself, sprawled in his creaky old arm-chair.The rickety little office, built of red brick, was set flush with the street—the main street of the town of Bethel.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >贝塞尔镇位于蓝岭的山麓小丘上。上方的山峰高高地耸入云霄。下方浑浊的卡托巴河沿着阴郁的山谷流淌，河水闪耀着黄色的光芒。</td>
		<td class="en">Bethel rested upon the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge.Above it the mountains were piled to the sky.Far below it the turbid Catawba gleamed yellow along its disconsolate valley.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >正是六月里最为闷热的时候。贝塞尔镇在微热的阴影里打着盹。没有任何生意。周围是如此地安静，戈锐斜靠在他的椅子里，清晰地听到从大陪审团房间里传来的筹码的咔哒声。在那里，“法院帮”正在打扑克。从事务所敞开的后门望去，草地上有一条踩出来的小路，弯弯曲曲地通向法院大楼。正是因为踩上了这条小路，戈锐才失去了一切——先是几千美元的遗产，接着是祖屋，最后是他残存的自尊和男子气概。那帮人把他榨干了。倾家荡产的赌棍变成了酒鬼和寄生虫；终于有一天他看到那帮榨干他的人不再允许他上桌玩扑克了。他的话再也没有人当回事。每日的牌局依旧，而他却已沦为不光彩的旁观者了。县行政司法官，县书记员，爱开玩笑的行政司法官助理，快乐的律师和一个脸色苍白的“山谷里来的人”坐镇赌桌，毛被剪光的戈锐被大家心照不宣地建议离开，说是让他待毛长长了再来。</td>
		<td class="en">The June day was at its sultriest hour.Bethel dozed in the tepid shade.Trade was not.It was so still that Goree, reclining in his chair, distinctly heard the clicking of the chips in the grand-jury room, where the “court-house gang” was playing poker.From the open back door of the office a well-worn path meandered across the grassy lot to the court-house.The treading out of that path had cost Goree all he ever had—first inheritance of a few thousand dollars, next the old family home, and, latterly the last shreds of his self-respect and manhood.The “gang” had cleaned him out.The broken gambler had turned drunkard and parasite; he had lived to see this day come when the men who had stripped him denied him a seat at the game.His word was no longer to be taken.The daily bouts at cards had arranged itself accordingly, and to him was assigned the ignoble part of the onlooker.The sheriff, the county clerk, a sportive deputy, a gay attorney, and a chalk-faced man hailing “from the valley,” sat at table, and the sheared one was thus tacitly advised to go and grow more wool.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >很快，戈锐厌倦了被排斥在外，他起身返回自己的事务所，踉踉跄跄地走在这条倒霉小路上，还一边喃喃自语。他从桌子底下拿出来一个小口大酒瓶，把里面玉米酿的威士忌喝下后，倒在了椅子里，带着某种悲伤而冷漠的情绪，盯着外面夏日薄雾之下的山峦。他看到的在闪锌矿边上的小块白色的地就是劳雷尔村，他就是在那附近出生和成长的。那里也是戈锐和科尔特伦两家族世仇的诞生地。现在，戈锐家族除了他这个被拔了毛轻微烧焦的可怜虫之外，就没有别的直接继承人了。至于科尔特伦家族，他们也只剩下一个男性继承人了——阿布纳·科尔特伦上校，这个有钱有地位的人是州议会成员，与戈锐的父亲同辈。两个家族之间的世仇是这个地区非常典型的一种，它留下了血淋淋的记录，满是仇恨、冤屈与杀戮。不过现在燕西·戈锐想的可不是世仇。他那迷糊的大脑正无望地想着如何维持以后的生计和他的这些愚蠢的嗜好。近来，家族的老朋友们保证了他的吃和住的问题，可是他们不会给他买威士忌，而他却离不开威士忌。他的律师业务绝迹了，两年里没有一件案子委托他办理。他靠借钱和别人接济过日子，如果说他没有变得更消沉，那似乎只是因为他还没碰到那样的机会。只要再有一次机会——他对自己说——只要他能再下一次注， 他想他就会赢；但他已经没有什么东西可以卖了，他的信用也已经被他耗尽了。 </td>
		<td class="en">Soon wearying of his ostracism, Goree had departed for his office, muttering to himself as he unsteadily traversed the unlucky pathway.After a drink of corn whiskey from a demijohn under the table, he had flung himself into the chair, staring, in a sort of maudlin apathy, out at the mountains immersed in the summer haze.The little white patch he saw away up on the side of Blackjack was Laurel, the village near which he had been born and bred.There, also, was the birthplace of the feud between the Gorees and the Coltranes.Now no direct heir of the Gorees survived except this plucked and singed bird of misfortune.To the Coltranes, also, but one male supporter was left—Colonel Abner Coltrane, a man of substance and standing, a member of the State Legislature, and a contemporary with Goree’s father.The feud had been a typical one of the region; it had left a red record of hate, wrong and slaughter.But Yancey Goree was not thinking of feuds.His befuddled brain was hopelessly attacking the problem of the future maintenance of himself and his favourite follies.Of late, old friends of the family had seen to it that he had whereof to eat and a place to sleep—but whiskey they would not buy for him, and he must have whiskey.His law business was extinct; no case had been intrusted to him in two years.He had been a borrower and a sponge, and it seemed that if he fell no lower it would be from lack of opportunity.One more chance—he was saying to himself—if he had one more stake at the game, he thought he could win; but he had nothing left to sell, and his credit was more than exhausted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >即使是在这样的悲惨境况中，当他想起六个月前买下他家老宅的那个人，他还是会忍不住笑出来。他们是来自“深山老林”的两个怪人，派克·加维和他的妻子。一提到“深山老林”，山里人总是把手一挥指向群山，都知道那指的是最偏远的要塞之地，深不可测的峡谷，匪徒出没之地，狼和熊的巢穴。在闪锌矿的山肩上有一间小木屋，这对奇怪的夫妇隐退在这最荒凉的地方，已经静居了二十年。他们既没有孩子也没有养狗来减轻这深山里的沉寂。村落里的人几乎不知道派克·加维，但和他打过交道的人都说他“像个疯子”。他声称除了打松鼠之外，他没有任何的职业，不过他偶尔也“贩点私酒”作为消遣。有一次“税务官们”把他从他的老窝里拖了出来，他像猎狗一样安静而绝望地挣扎着，被判到州立监狱服刑两年。出狱之后，他像一只愤怒的黄鼠狼，急匆匆地回老窝去了。</td>
		<td class="en">He could not help smiling, even in his misery, as he thought of the man to whom, six months before, he had sold the old Goree homestead.There had come from “back yan’” in the mountains two of the strangest creatures, a man named Pike Garvey and his wife.“Back yan’,” with a wave of the hand toward the hills, was understood among the mountaineers to designate the remotest fastnesses, the unplumbed gorges, the haunts of lawbreakers, the wolf’s den, and the boudoir of the bear.In the cabin far up on Blackjack’s shoulder, in the wildest part of these retreats, this odd couple had lived for twenty years.They had neither dog nor children to mitigate the heavy silence of the hills.Pike Garvey was little known in the settlements, but all who had dealt with him pronounced him “crazy as a loon.”He acknowledged no occupation save that of a squirrel hunter, but he “moonshined” occasionally by way of diversion.Once the “revenues” had dragged him from his lair, fighting silently and desperately like a terrier, and he had been sent to state’s prison for two years.Released, he popped back into his hole like an angry weasel.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >幸运女神，越过了许多殷切的追求者，任性地向闪锌矿林中腹地飞来，冲派克和他的忠实伴侣微笑。</td>
		<td class="en">Fortune, passing over many anxious wooers, made a freakish flight into Blackjack’s bosky pockets to smile upon Pike and his faithful partner.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有一天，一群戴着眼镜、穿着灯笼裤的古怪的勘探者闯到了加维小木屋附近。怕是税务官又来了，加维把他用来打松鼠的来复枪从挂钩上取下，远远地朝他们开了一枪。幸运的是他没有打中，等这些运气好并且毫无察觉的勘探队员走近了，加维才发现他们和法律司法那些东西一点关系都没有。后来，他们提出给加维夫妇一大笔崭新的绿花花的现钞，买下他们家已经开垦的30英亩的地，为了给这一疯狂行为作解释，他们说了一些无关的不适当的胡话，说这块地底下是云母矿。 </td>
		<td class="en">One day a party of spectacled, knickerbockered, and altogether absurd prospectors invaded the vicinity of the Garvey’s cabin.Pike lifted his squirrel rifle off the hooks and took a shot at them at long range on the chance of their being revenues.Happily he missed, and the unconscious agents of good luck drew nearer, disclosing their innocence of anything resembling law or justice.Later on, they offered the Garveys an enormous quantity of ready, green, crisp money for their thirty-acre patch of cleared land, mentioning, as an excuse for such a mad action, some irrelevant and inadequate nonsense about a bed of mica underlying the said property.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当加维夫妇得到了这些他们数也数不完的钱以后，闪锌矿生活的匮乏之处就凸显出来了。派克开始提到要买新鞋子，买桶烟草放在角落里，给他的来复枪买个新的保险栓，还把玛蒂拉带到山边某处，指给她看在这里安一台小的火炮——无疑他们现在买得起了——就可以控制和防御通向小木屋的唯一通道，就可以永远把那些税务官和爱搅和的陌生人所带来的麻烦挡在外面。</td>
		<td class="en">When the Garveys became possessed of so many dollars that they faltered in computing them, the deficiencies of life on Blackjack began to grow prominent.Pike began to talk of new shoes, a hogshead of tobacco to set in the corner, a new lock to his rifle; and, leading Martella to a certain spot on the mountain-side, he pointed out to her how a small cannon—doubtless a thing not beyond the scope of their fortune in price—might be planted so as to command and defend the sole accessible trail to the cabin, to the confusion of revenues and meddling strangers forever.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但亚当并没有为夏娃着想。这些东西对于加维来说代表了财富的力量了，但在这间阴暗破败的小屋里沉睡着远高于这些原始渴望的野心。在加维太太的内心还留存着一点在闪锌矿生活了二十年仍未被消磨的女性的东西。很长的一段时间里，她的耳朵正午听到的是林中斑驳的树皮剥落的声音，晚上听到的是狼群在岩块上长啸，这些足以泯灭她的虚荣心。她变得身材发胖，皮肤发黄，阴郁沮丧。但有了钱以后，她感到她那呈现女性特权的欲望重新被点燃——她想坐在茶桌边喝茶；想买点花哨无用的小玩意；想用庆典和礼节来粉饰生活的可怕真相。于是她冷漠地否决了派克要加固他们居所的提议，并且宣布他们要下到凡尘俗世去，周旋在社交场合中。</td>
		<td class="en">But Adam reckoned without his Eve.These things represented to him the applied power of wealth, but there slumbered in his dingy cabin an ambition that soared far above his primitive wants.Somewhere in Mrs. Garvey’s bosom still survived a spot of femininity unstarved by twenty years of Blackjack.For so long a time the sounds in her ears had been the scaly-barks dropping in the woods at noon, and the wolves singing among the rocks at night, and it was enough to have purged her of vanities.She had grown fat and sad and yellow and dull.But when the means came, she felt a rekindled desire to assume the perquisites of her sex—to sit at tea tables; to buy futile things; to whitewash the hideous veracity of life with a little form and ceremony.So she coldly vetoed Pike’s proposed system of fortifications, and announced that they would descend upon the world, and gyrate socially.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >最终，这件事就这么定了下来，并且实现了。加维太太喜欢住到大的山谷小镇去，派克则渴望过原始的隐居生活，于是劳雷尔村就成了两夫妇相互妥协的结果。劳雷尔村偶尔会举行一些起码的社会活动，适合满足玛蒂拉的欲望，而且对于派克来说这里也不是完全不值得推荐，因其与大山毗邻，于是如果时髦的社会生活过不惯，他们也能马上归隐。</td>
		<td class="en">And thus, at length, it was decided, and the thing done.The village of Laurel was their compromise between Mrs. Garvey’s preference for one of the large valley towns and Pike’s hankering for primeval solitudes.Laurel yielded a halting round of feeble social distractions comportable with Martella’s ambitions, and was not entirely without recommendation to Pike, its contiguity to the mountains presenting advantages for sudden retreat in case fashionable society should make it advisable.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们要来劳雷尔村的时候正好赶上了燕西·戈锐正迫不及待地要把财产变成现金的时候，于是他们买下了戈锐家的老房子，把四千美元现金交到了这个败家子颤抖的手中。</td>
		<td class="en">Their descent upon Laurel had been coincident with Yancey Goree’s feverish desire to convert property into cash, and they bought the old Goree homestead, paying four thousand dollars ready money into the spendthrift’s shaking hands.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是，当戈锐家族丢人现眼的最后一个继承人被赢光了他的财产的“好友”们给赶出来，懒散地躺在他那位于街区尽头的不体面的事务所时，两个陌生人却住进了他的祖屋。</td>
		<td class="en">Thus it happened that while the disreputable last of the Gorees sprawled in his disreputable office, at the end of his row, spurned by the cronies whom he had gorged, strangers dwelt in the halls of his fathers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一团灰尘在炙热的街面上慢慢升腾翻滚，其中似乎有什么东西正移动着。 微风把灰尘吹到了一边，一匹慵懒的灰马拉着一辆光亮崭新的马车显现出来。当接近戈锐的事务所的时候，马车离开了街的中央，最终停在了戈锐门前的街沟旁。</td>
		<td class="en">A cloud of dust was rolling, slowly up the parched street, with something travelling in the midst of it.A little breeze wafted the cloud to one side, and a new, brightly painted carryall, drawn by a slothful gray horse, became visible.The vehicle deflected from the middle of the street as it neared Goree’s office, and stopped in the gutter directly in front of his door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >马车前座坐着一个身着黑呢衣服的瘦高男人，僵硬的双手困在一副黄色的羊皮手套里。后座上坐着一位不畏六月炎夏的女士。她壮硕的身躯裹在紧身的丝绸衣服里，这衣服由大量不断变化的色彩构成，于是被称为“变色服”。她笔直地坐着，摇着一把过于花哨的扇子，目光呆滞地盯着街道的远处。不管玛蒂拉·加维的内心对舒适的新生活感到多么欣喜，闪锌矿已经改造了她的外表。它将她的面容塑造成肤浅愚蠢的样子，用自己冷若峭壁的漠然和深藏内心的寂寥浸染了她。无论身处何方，她好像总能听到斑驳的树皮落下，啪嗒啪嗒滚下山去的声音。她总能听到在静谧的夜晚里闪锌矿可怕的寂静之声。</td>
		<td class="en">On the front seat sat a gaunt, tall man, dressed in black broadcloth, his rigid hands incarcerated in yellow kid gloves.On the back seat was a lady who triumphed over the June heat.Her stout form was armoured in a skintight silk dress of the description known as “changeable,” being a gorgeous combination of shifting hues.She sat erect, waving a much-ornamented fan, with her eyes fixed stonily far down the street.However Martella Garvey’s heart might be rejoicing at the pleasures of her new life, Blackjack had done his work with her exterior.He had carved her countenance to the image of emptiness and inanity; had imbued her with the stolidity of his crags, and the reserve of his hushed interiors.She always seemed to hear, whatever her surroundings were, the scaly-barks falling and pattering down the mountain-side.She could always hear the awful silence of Blackjack sounding through the stillest of nights.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >戈锐了无兴致地看着这辆庄严的马车赶到了他门前，但是当这位瘦高的赶车人把缰绳绕在马鞭上，笨拙地下了车走进他的事务所的时候，他认出来这是焕然一新、刚刚变文明的派克·加维，于是他晃晃悠悠地站起来迎接这个人。</td>
		<td class="en">Goree watched this solemn equipage, as it drove to his door, with only faint interest; but when the lank driver wrapped the reins about his whip, awkwardly descended, and stepped into the office, he rose unsteadily to receive him, recognizing Pike Garvey, the new, the transformed, the recently civilized.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >山里人坐在了戈锐给他的椅子上。那些怀疑加维脑子是否正常的人可以从他的面部表情得到强有力的证据。他的脸太长，呈灰暗的桔黄色，像雕像一样面无表情。没有睫毛，眨也不眨的泛白的蓝色圆眼睛使他那原本可怖的面容显得更加怪异。戈锐不知道他来做什么。</td>
		<td class="en">The mountaineer took the chair Goree offered him.They who cast doubts upon Garvey’s soundness of mind had a strong witness in the man’s countenance.His face was too long, a dull saffron in hue, and immobile as a statue’s.Pale-blue, unwinking round eyes without lashes added to the singularity of his gruesome visage.Goree was at a loss to account for the visit.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >戈锐问：“加维先生，在劳雷尔村的一切都还好吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Everything all right at Laurel, Mr. Garvey?” he inquired.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一切都挺好，先生，加维太太和我都对房子很满意。我太太喜欢你那所老房子，也喜欢那里的邻居们。她认为她要的是社交生活，现在她得到了。罗杰斯家，哈普古德家，普拉特家和特洛伊家都拜访过她了，她也在其中的大多数人家里吃过饭了。最有名望的村民邀请她参加了各种各样的活动。戈锐先生，我不能说这些东西适合我，对于我来说，还是给我那儿的那些东西比较好。”加维戴着黄手套的大手向山那边挥了一下。那里才是我该待的地方，和野蜂狗熊在一起。不过我来不是说这个的，戈锐先生。你还有件东西我太太和我想买。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Everything all right, sir, and mighty pleased is Missis Garvey and me with the property.Missis Garvey likes yo’ old place, and she likes the neighbourhood.Society is what she ‘lows she wants, and she is gettin’ of it.The Rogerses, the Hapgoods, the Pratts and the Troys hev been to see Missis Garvey, and she hev et meals to most of thar houses.The best folks hev axed her to differ’nt kinds of doin’s.I cyan’t say, Mr. Goree, that sech things suits me—fur me, give me them thar.”Garvey’s huge, yellow-gloved hand flourished in the direction of the mountains.“That’s whar I b’long, ‘mongst the wild honey bees and the b’ars.But that ain’t what I come fur to say, Mr. Goree.Thar’s somethin’ you got what me and Missis Garvey wants to buy.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“买！”戈锐重复道。“从我这里？”接着他厉声笑起来。“我想你肯定弄错了。我想你肯定弄错了。我全卖给你了，就像你自己说的那样，‘锁、农具和水桶。’就连通枪用的通条都没留下。” </td>
		<td class="en">“Buy!” echoed Goree.“From me?”Then he laughed harshly.“I reckon you are mistaken about that.I reckon you are mistaken about that.I sold out to you, as you yourself expressed it, ‘lock, stock and barrel.’There isn’t even a ramrod left to sell.”</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >戈锐摇头。“连橱柜都空了。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">Goree shook his head.“The cupboard’s bare,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们有钱，”这位山里人不达目的誓不罢休地说，“有一堆。过去我们穷得像负鼠，现在我们有钱天天请客吃饭。加维太太说，连村里最上等的人都认得我们了。但我们还差一样东西。她说那个本来应该在买房时就列在清单上，但是给漏了。‘那么就带上钱’，她说，‘公平正当地把它买下来。’”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他清晰而缓慢地说：“你的家族与科尔特伦家族之间有一桩世仇。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There’s a old feud,” he said distinctly and slowly, “‘tween you ‘uns and the Coltranes.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >戈锐不悦地皱了皱眉头。跟一个结有世仇的人提他的世仇严重违反了山区的礼规。来自“深山老林”的这个人和律师一样非常清楚这一点。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没有冒犯的意思，”他接着说，“只是纯粹的买卖。加维太太详细研究了有关世仇的一切。 山区里大多数有地位的人都有世仇。塞特尔与戈福思，兰金与博伊德，赛勒和加洛韦，这些家族之间都各有长达二十年到一百年不等的世仇。最近一个进行复仇的人是你叔叔，佩斯利·戈锐法官，休庭以后他从法官席上开枪打死了莱恩·科尔特伦。加维太太和我都是在一穷二白的穷苦人家出生的。没人要和我们结下世仇，我们连家族体系都没有。加维太太说，不论在哪里，有身份地位的人家总有世仇。我们没有身份地位，但我们要尽力买到这些。‘那么拿上钱，’加维太太说，‘公平正当地买下戈锐先生的世仇。’”</td>

		<td class="en">The little roll of currency on the table slowly untwisted itself, writhing and jumping as its folds relaxed.In the silence that followed Garvey’s last speech the rattling of the poker chips in the court-house could be plainly heard.Goree knew that the sheriff had just won a pot, for the subdued whoop with which he always greeted a victory floated across the square upon the crinkly heat waves.Beads of moisture stood on Goree’s brow.Stooping, he drew the wicker-covered demijohn from under the table, and filled a tumbler from it.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你说对了，” 戈锐急切地说，“现在我还是一样注重外表，只是没有表现出来。哎，我像一只公火鸡一样爱慕虚荣，像魔鬼“明亮之星”一样骄傲。我想请求您一件小事，纵容一下我这个弱点。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Right you are,” said Goree eagerly.“And it’s in me yet, though it don’t show.Oh, I’m as vain as a turkey gobbler, and as proud as Lucifer.I’m going to ask you to indulge this weakness of mine in a little matter.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“说吧，燕西。如果你愿意，我们就封你做劳雷尔的公爵和蓝岭的男爵；你可以从斯特拉的孔雀尾巴上拔下羽毛，戴在你的帽子上。</td>
		<td class="en">“Speak out, Yancey.We’ll create you Duke of Laurel and Baron of Blue Ridge, if you choose; and you shall have a feather out of Stella’s peacock’s tail to wear in your hat.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我是认真的。再过几分钟我们就要经过山坡上那座房子，那是我出生的地方，那是我家族居住了快一个世纪的地方。如今陌生人住在那里面——再瞧瞧我的样子！我马上会让他们看到我衣衫褴褛、穷苦潦倒的样子，一个败家子和乞丐的样子。科尔特伦上校，这样子我感到非常羞耻。我想请您让我穿您的衣服，戴上您的帽子，直到我们走远了，他们看不到我们为止。我知道您会认为这是一种愚蠢的骄傲，但是我希望我经过故居的时候可以表现得尽可能体面点。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m in earnest.In a few minutes we’ll pass the house up there on the hill where I was born, and where my people have lived for nearly a century.Strangers live there now—and look at me!I am about to show myself to them ragged and poverty-stricken, a wastrel and a beggar.Colonel Coltrane, I’m ashamed to do it.I want you to let me wear your coat and hat until we are out of sight beyond.I know you think it a foolish pride, but I want to make as good a showing as I can when I pass the old place.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，这有什么意义呢？”科尔特伦拿他同伴清醒的外表和从容的行为与古怪的请求进行对比时，心里这样想。但是他已经解开了外套的纽扣，欣然同意了，好像这一想法一点都不奇怪。</td>
		<td class="en">“Now, what does this mean?” said Coltrane to himself, as he compared his companion’s sane looks and quiet demeanour with his strange request.But he was already unbuttoning the coat, assenting readily, as if the fancy were in no wise to be considered strange.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >外套和帽子非常合戈锐的身。他扣好了外套的扣子，露出了满意和尊贵的神情。他和科尔特伦身材相似——相当高，魁梧而且挺拔。他们相差25岁，但是从外表上看像是兄弟。戈锐看上去比他的年龄更老；他的脸臃肿、长了皱纹；上校脸色光鲜，气色红润。他穿上了戈锐那破烂不堪的亚麻旧外套，还戴上了那褪了色的阔边帽。</td>
		<td class="en">The coat and hat fitted Goree well.He buttoned the former about him with a look of satisfaction and dignity.He and Coltrane were nearly the same size—rather tall, portly, and erect.Twenty-five years were between them, but in appearance they might have been brothers.Goree looked older than his age; his face was puffy and lined; the colonel had the smooth, fresh complexion of a temperate liver.He put on Goree’s disreputable old flax coat and faded slouch hat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“现在，”戈锐拉好缰绳，说道，“我好了。上校，我想叫你走在我身后，离我十英尺远，当我们经过的时候，他们可以清楚地看看我。不管怎样，他们不会认为我是过时的人。总之，我想我将再一次在他们面前体面地露脸。我们继续前行吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Now,” said Goree, taking up the reins, “I’m all right.I want you to ride about ten feet in the rear as we go by, Colonel, so that they can get a good look at me.They’ll see I’m no back number yet, by any means.I guess I’ll show up pretty well to them once more, anyhow.Let’s ride on.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他优雅地骑着马向那座山出发，上校按照他的吩咐尾随其后。</td>
		<td class="en">He set out up the hill at a smart trot, the colonel following, as he had been requested.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >戈锐挺拔地坐在了马鞍上，头高昂着，但是他的眼睛转向了右边，敏锐地扫过了那老宅院子里每一丛灌木，每一块栅栏，每一个隐蔽的地方。他曾对自己嘀咕：“那个疯狂的傻子不会真的这么做吧，还是我在幻想呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">Goree sat straight in the saddle, with head erect, but his eyes were turned to the right, sharply scanning every shrub and fence and hiding-place in the old homestead yard.Once he muttered to himself, “Will the crazy fool try it, or did I dream half of it?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就在他来到他家祖坟对面时，他看到了自己一直寻找的东西——一缕白烟从角落里茂盛的松林中冒出来。他向左边慢慢地倒下去，科尔特伦才能有时间驱马赶到那边，用手臂扶住他。</td>
		<td class="en">It was when he came opposite the little family burying ground that he saw what he had been looking for—a puff of white smoke, coming from the thick cedars in one corner.He toppled so slowly to the left that Coltrane had time to urge his horse to that side, and catch him with one arm.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个松鼠猎人并没有自吹自己的枪法。他把子弹射到了他想要的位置，也是戈锐预料的部位——子弹穿过了阿布纳·科尔特伦上校黑色礼服，射中了他的胸部。</td>
		<td class="en">The squirrel hunter had not overpraised his aim.He had sent the bullet where he intended, and where Goree had expected that it would pass—through the breast of Colonel Abner Coltrane’s black frock coat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >戈锐重重地靠在了科尔特伦的身上，但是他并没有摔下去。两匹马并排走，肩并着肩，上校的手臂扶着他稳稳地坐在马上。半公里之外，劳雷尔村上一些白色小屋透过树丛闪烁着光。戈锐伸出了一只手，四处摸索，直到放在科尔特伦握住马笼头的手指上。</td>
		<td class="en">Goree leaned heavily against Coltrane, but he did not fall.The horses kept pace, side by side, and the Colonel’s arm kept him steady.The little white houses of Laurel shone through the trees, half a mile away.Goree reached out one hand and groped until it rested upon Coltrane’s fingers, which held his bridle.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好朋友。”他说，也只说了这么多。</td>
		<td class="en">“Good friend,” he said, and that was all.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >燕西·戈锐做到了，当经过他的祖屋时，他考虑了种种，尽最大的努力表现出他最好的一面。</td>
		<td class="en">Thus did Yancey Goree, as be rode past his old home, make, considering all things, the best showing that was in his power.</td></tr>
