		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >许多年前当我还年轻的时候，我刚刚离开牛津，就被送上完成学业的伟大征程。想来我的父母曾试图向我灌输智慧，却徒劳无果，所以他们让我到社会上闯荡，希望我能自然而然地获得才智。这似乎是至少九成以上的年轻人被送往国外的原因。</td>
		<td class="en">Many years since, when I was a young man, and had just left Oxford, I was sent on the grand tour to finish my education.I believe my parents had tried in vain to inoculate me with wisdom; so they sent me to mingle with society, in hopes I might take it the natural way.Such, at least, appears to be the reason for which nine-tenths of our youngsters are sent abroad.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >旅行期间，我在威尼斯呆了一段时间。这个流行面具和凤尾船的地方里弥漫着冒险与神秘的气氛，让我兴奋异常。一对懒散的黑色眸子更是彻底将我征服，它穿过意大利式的斗篷拨动了我的心弦。于是，我说服自己，我留在威尼斯是为了学习这里的风土人情。至少我是这么说服我的朋友们的，而这也达到了我的全部目的。实际上，我有点沉迷于意大利人独特的性格和作风。我的脑海中充满了意大利式的浪漫，所以我总会期待奇遇出现。</td>
		<td class="en">In the course of my tour I remained some time at Venice.The romantic character of the place delighted me; I was very much amused by the air of adventure and intrigue that prevailed in this region of masks and gondolas; and I was exceedingly smitten by a pair of languishing black eyes, that played upon my heart from under an Italian mantle.So I persuaded myself that I was lingering at Venice to study men and manners.At least I persuaded my friends so, and that answered all my purpose.Indeed, I was a little prone to be struck by peculiarities in character and conduct, and my imagination was so full of romantic associations with Italy, that I was always on the lookout for adventure.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在这座古老神奇的城市中，一切都符合我的这种心情。我的套房位于大运河畔一座巍峨幽静的宫殿中。这宫殿原先是威尼斯贵族的府邸，虽然已不再壮丽，却依旧奢华。我雇的这位船夫是这一行中最精明的一个，他活跃、快乐又聪明，和他的同行一样守口如瓶，也就是说，除了自己的主人，他对谁都保密。受雇还不到一周，他就开始告诉我威尼斯的所有隐秘了。我喜欢这里的神秘和宁静。有时我站在窗前，看到一艘黑色的凤尾船在暮霭中神秘地滑过，当我只能看到船上发出微光的灯笼时，我就会跳进自己的小艇，打手势让船夫追上去。不过，我扯远了，不说年轻时干的傻事了。准男爵说着话锋一转：“咱们还是说正经的吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">Every thing chimed in with such a humor in this old mermaid of a city.My suite of apartments were in a proud, melancholy palace on the grand canal, formerly the residence of a Magnifico, and sumptuous with the traces of decayed grandeur.My gondolier was one of the shrewdest of his class, active, merry, intelligent, and, like his brethren, secret as the grave; that is to say, secret to all the world except his master.I had not had him a week before he put me behind all the curtains in Venice.I liked the silence and mystery of the place, and when I sometimes saw from my window a black gondola gliding mysteriously along in the dusk of the evening, with nothing visible but its little glimmering lantern, I would jump into my own zenduletto, and give a signal for pursuit.But I am running away from my subject with the recollection of youthful follies, said the Baronet, checking himself; “let me come to the point.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我常去的一家娱乐场所就是坐落在圣马克大广场一侧、位于拱廊下面的卡西诺酒吧。意大利的夏夜闷热，人们通宵都呆在外面。我也常常去那里闲逛，吃冰淇淋。一天晚上，在我正坐在那里的时候，我看见一群意大利人在酒吧对面的桌子边坐下。他们的谈话快活生动，带着意大利人的活泼，还夹杂着各种手势。</td>
		<td class="en">Among my familiar resorts was a Cassino under the Arcades on one side of the grand square of St. Mark.Here I used frequently to lounge and take my ice on those warm summer nights when in Italy everybody lives abroad until morning.I was seated here one evening, when a group of Italians took seat at a table on the opposite side of the saloon.Their conversation was gay and animated, and carried on with Italian vivacity and gesticulation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，我注意到了其中的一个年轻人，尽管他努力让自己融入其中，可看上去他似乎并未参与讨论，也没从中找到什么乐趣。他长得又高又瘦，外表极富魅力。他五官精致，只是面容憔悴。他长着一头又密又亮的黑发，微微弯曲，映衬着他苍白的面庞。他形容枯槁，脸上深深的皱纹似乎是忧虑所致，而非岁月弄人，因为很显然他正值壮年。他的眼睛炯炯有神，富于表达，眼神却飘忽而狂野。他好像被某种古怪的幻想或恐惧所折磨。尽管他竭尽全力想要将注意力集中在同伴的谈话上，可我还是注意到，他会时不时地把头慢慢转过去，朝背后看看，然后突然将目光收回，身体随之一震，好像看到了什么让人痛苦的场景似的。这动作大约每隔一分钟就一次，而且我看到在他似乎还没从前一次惊恐中恢复的时候，就已经慢慢地等待着下一次的到来了。</td>
		<td class="en">I remarked among them one young man, however, who appeared to take no share, and find no enjoyment in the conversation; though he seemed to force himself to attend to it.He was tall and slender, and of extremely prepossessing appearance.His features were fine, though emaciated.He had a profusion of black glossy hair that curled lightly about his head, and contrasted with the extreme paleness of his countenance.His brow was haggard; deep furrows seemed to have been ploughed into his visage by care, not by age, for he was evidently in the prime of youth.His eye was full of expression and fire, but wild and unsteady.He seemed to be tormented by some strange fancy or apprehension.In spite of every effort to fix his attention on the conversation of his companions, I noticed that every now and then he would turn his head slowly round, give a glance over his shoulder, and then withdraw it with a sudden jerk, as if something painful had met his eye.This was repeated at intervals of about a minute, and he appeared hardly to have got over one shock, before I saw him slowly preparing to encounter another.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这群人在卡西诺坐了一会，就埋单离开了。这个年轻人是最后一个离开酒吧的，我看见他临出门时还那样扭头向后看了一眼。我当时那个年纪对好奇的东西很容易产生浪漫的情绪，所以我抑制不住内心的冲动，站起身跟着他走了出去。他们沿着拱廊慢慢地走过去，一路上有说有笑。他们穿过小广场，站在广场中央欣赏起景色来。那天的月亮分外皎洁，正是意大利典型的晴朗的天气。月光照在圣马克大街的高塔上，将大教堂气派的前门和巍峨的圆顶照得很明亮。那群人兴致勃勃地说着，表达着心中的喜悦。我一直盯着那个年轻人。只有他看起来心不在焉，心事重重。我注意到他还是那么孤独，可以说还在偷偷摸摸地向后望，和我在卡西诺见到的情形一模一样。这群人继续走着，而我在后面跟着；他们穿过布罗利奥路，转过公爵宫，上了凤尾船，迅速离开了。</td>
		<td class="en">After sitting some time in the Cassino, the party paid for the refreshments they had taken, and departed.The young man was the last to leave the saloon, and I remarked him glancing behind him in the same way, just as he passed out at the door.I could not resist the impulse to rise and follow him; for I was at an age when a romantic feeling of curiosity is easily awakened.The party walked slowly down the Arcades, talking and laughing as they went.They crossed the Piazzetta, but paused in the middle of it to enjoy the scene.It was one of those moonlight nights so brilliant and clear in the pure atmosphere of Italy.The moon-beams streamed on the tall tower of St. Mark, and lighted up the magnificent front and swelling domes of the Cathedral.The party expressed their delight in animated terms.I kept my eye upon the young man.He alone seemed abstracted and self-occupied.I noticed the same singular, and, as it were, furtive glance over the shoulder that had attracted my attention in the Cassino.The party moved on, and I followed; they passed along the walks called the Broglio; turned the corner of the Ducal palace, and getting into a gondola, glided swiftly away.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个年轻人的表情和举止一直在我的脑中挥之不去。他外表里的某种东西引起了我极大的兴趣。过了一两天，我在一家美术馆又遇见了他。他显然是个行家，因为他总能挑出那些名家的作品。从他对他的同伴说出的少许评论来看，他对艺术非常精通。可他的品味太过极端了。他关注萨尔瓦多·罗萨最粗犷荒凉的选景；他关注拉斐尔、提香和柯勒乔，欣赏他们用最柔软的线条来展现女性美。一看见这些画，他凝视的眼睛中就经常流露出瞬间的激情。但是，这种似乎只是短暂的遗忘而已。他还是会谨慎地回望，接着又迅速收回，好像看到了什么可怕的东西似的。</td>
		<td class="en">The countenance and conduct of this young man dwelt upon my mind.There was something in his appearance that interested me exceedingly.I met him a day or two after in a gallery of paintings.He was evidently a connoisseur, for he always singled out the most masterly productions, and the few remarks drawn from him by his companions showed an intimate acquaintance with the art.His own taste, however, ran on singular extremes.On Salvator Rosa in his most savage and solitary scenes; on Raphael, Titian, and Corregio in their softest delineations of female beauty.On these he would occasionally gaze with transient enthusiasm.But this seemed only a momentary forgetfulness.Still would recur that cautious glance behind, and always quickly withdrawn, as though something terrible had met his view.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >之后，我总能碰见他，在剧院里、舞会上、音乐厅里，在圣乔治花园里小道上，在圣马克大街广场上那些五花八门的表演中，亦或是里亚托桥边的商人云集的证券交易所里。实际上，他好像专门去人多的地方找热闹、找乐子，但对商业或娱乐活动却从来不感兴趣。他有时像是在痛苦地思考，一幅心不在焉的可怜模样；有时他又古怪地走来走去，不安地向后张望。起初，我没想过这可能是因为他害怕被逮捕，或是因为害怕被暗杀而引起的。但果真如此的话，他为什么总往外跑？为什么老是到外面抛头露面呢？</td>
		<td class="en">I encountered him frequently afterwards.At the theatre, at balls, at concerts; at the promenades in the gardens of San Georgio; at the grotesque exhibitions in the square of St. Mark; among the throng of merchants on the Exchange by the Rialto.He seemed, in fact, to seek crowds; to hunt after bustle and amusement; yet never to take any interest in either the business or gayety of the scene.Ever an air of painful thought, of wretched abstraction; and ever that strange and recurring movement, of glancing fearfully over the shoulder.I did not know at first but this might be caused by apprehension of arrest; or perhaps from dread of assassination.But, if so, why should he go thus continually abroad; why expose himself at all times and in all places?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我迫不及待地想要了解这个陌生人。年轻人之间浪漫的意气相投有时会吸引彼此，我正是因为这点才被他吸引的。他的忧郁让他在我眼中充满魅力，而他伤感的表情和男性风度无疑使他更具魅力。男性美甚至对男人也是有杀伤力的。我需要同英国人惯有的冷漠和笨嘴笨舌作斗争，而我还是克服了这点。又因为我总在卡西诺见到他，我们就渐渐熟络起来。对他，我倒没什么需要斗争的。他似乎和上流社会相反，实际上，他只要不单独一个人呆着，和谁在一起都行。</td>
		<td class="en">I became anxious to know this stranger.I was drawn to him by that Romantic sympathy that sometimes draws young men towards each other.His melancholy threw a charm about him in my eyes, which was no doubt heightened by the touching expression of his countenance, and the manly graces of his person; for manly beauty has its effect even upon man.I had an Englishman’s habitual diffidence and awkwardness of address to contend with; but I subdued it, and from frequently meeting him in the Cassino, gradually edged myself into his acquaintance.I had no reserve on his part to contend with.He seemed on the contrary to court society; and in fact to seek anything rather than be alone.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当他发现我真的对他很感兴趣时，他就全心全意地与我交起朋友来。他像一个快淹死的人那样死死抓住我。他会和我一起在圣马克大教堂附近来回散步，一走就是几个小时——或者在我的公寓里坐到深夜。他在我住的楼里租了套房子，还总要求在酒吧时，只要于我无碍就让他坐在我旁边。倒不是他多欣赏我的言论，而是他急于要找人陪伴，尤其是要找同情他的人。“我经常听人说”，他说，“英国人很真诚——感谢上帝，我终于找到一个英国人做朋友！”</td>
		<td class="en">When he found I really took an interest in him he threw himself entirely upon my friendship.He clung to me like a drowning man.He would walk with me for hours up and down the place of St. Mark—or he would sit until night was far advanced in my apartment; he took rooms under the same roof with me; and his constant request was, that I would permit him, when it did not incommode me, to sit by me in my saloon.It was not that he seemed to take a particular delight in my conversation; but rather that he craved the vicinity of a human being; and above all, of a being that sympathized with him.“I have often heard,” said he, “of the sincerity of Englishmen—thank God I have one at length for a friend!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可他似乎只打算找我作伴，而从不需要我的同情。他从没试着向我打开心扉，似乎他的心中有一种牢不可破的痛苦在侵蚀着他，“说或不说”都不能让他舒服。忧郁吞噬着他的心，好像要吸干他的血液似的。这不是一种柔和的痛苦——相思病那种，而是一种令人焦灼、枯萎的痛苦。有时，我发现他嘴唇干燥发热，几乎是在大口喘气而不是呼吸，眼睛布满血丝，脸颊苍白略带青色，有时还会有淡淡的横纹——愤恨的火焰在蚕食他的心。当我挽着他时，我感到他时不时抽筋似地把我的胳膊拉向他那边，他的手会不自觉地攥紧，接着他的整个身体也会随之一震。我曾和他谈起过他的忧郁，并努力想从他那得到答案——他总是推脱，一点也不肯透露。“不要追问我原因，”他说，“你知道了也无济于事，你甚至都不会愿意帮忙——反过来，我还会失去你对我的同情，这——”他说着，又颤抖着按住我的手，“对我而言太珍贵了，我不能冒这个险。”</td>
		<td class="en">Yet he never seemed disposed to avail himself of my sympathy other than by mere companionship.He never sought to unbosom himself to me; there appeared to be a settled corroding anguish in his bosom that neither could be soothed “by silence nor by speaking.”A devouring melancholy preyed upon his heart, and seemed to be drying up the very blood in his veins.It was not a soft melancholy—the disease of the affections; but a parching, withering agony.I could see at times that his mouth was dry and feverish; he almost panted rather than breathed; his eyes were bloodshot; his cheeks pale and livid; with now and then faint streaks athwart them—baleful gleams of the fire that was consuming his heart.As my arm was within his, I felt him press it at times with a convulsive motion to his side; his hands would clinch themselves involuntarily, and a kind of shudder would run through his frame.I reasoned with him about his melancholy, and sought to draw from him the cause—he shrunk from all confiding.“Do not seek to know it,” said he, “you could not relieve it if you knew it; you would not even seek to relieve it—on the contrary, I should lose your sympathy; and that,” said he, pressing my hand convulsively, “that I feel has become too dear to me to risk.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我努力唤起他内心的希望。他还年轻，生命中还有成千上万种乐趣等着他享受。年轻的心应该做出积极的反应，这会治愈内心所受到的伤害——“来，过来，”我说，“没有青春摆脱不了的忧愁。”——“不！不！”他咬紧牙说道，绝望地用拳头反复捶打胸口——“是这儿——就是这儿——它深深地扎根在我心底，正在吸着我的血。</td>
		<td class="en">I endeavored to awaken hope within him.He was young; life had a thousand pleasures in store for him; there is a healthy reaction in the youthful heart; it medicines its own wounds—“Come, come,” said I, “there is no grief so great that youth cannot outgrow it.”—“No! no!” said he, clinching his teeth, and striking repeatedly, with the energy of despair, upon his bosom—“It is here—here—deep-rooted; draining my heart’s blood.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他不停地生长着，而我的心在慢慢枯萎！有个可怕的东西一直在监视我，让我不得安宁——他一步步紧跟着我，直到把我推入坟墓！”</td>
		<td class="en">It grows and grows, while my heart withers and withers!I have a dreadful monitor that gives me no repose—that follows me step by step; and will follow me step by step, until it pushes me into my grave!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >说到这里，他情不自禁地又转过头恐惧地看了一眼，然后将身体缩回去，比先前更加恐惧。我忍不住提到他的这个动作，在我看来这不过是神经上的小毛病罢了。我刚提到这一点，他的脸就变红、抽搐起来——两只手抓住我：“看在上帝的份上，”他叫喊着，声音异常痛苦——“别再提这个了。我们不说这个好吗，我的朋友。你救不了我，实际上，你不但救不了我，还可能会增添我的痛苦——将来有一天你会知道一切真相的。”</td>
		<td class="en">As he said this he gave involuntarily one of those fearful glances over his shoulder, and shrunk back with more than usual horror.I could not resist the temptation to allude to this movement, which I supposed to be some mere malady of the nerves.The moment I mentioned it his face became crimsoned and convulsed—he grasped me by both hands: “For God’s sake,” exclaimed he, with a piercing agony of voice—“never allude to that again; let us avoid this subject, my friend; you cannot relieve me, indeed you cannot relieve me; but you may add to the torments I suffer;—at some future day you shall know all.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我再没提起过这事了。因为不管我有多好奇，他已经那么痛苦了，我实在不忍心因为我的介入而再增加他的痛苦。我想尽各种方法来转移他的注意力，让他从长期的忧郁中振作起来。他看到了我的努力，也尽力配合，因为他的本性其实一点也不任性无常。相反，从他的整个态度来看，他倒是相当的直率、慷慨、谦逊。他表现出的感情都是高尚的。他不要求放纵，也不乞求宽容。他似乎满足于默默承受痛苦，只求能陪在我身边承受这种痛苦。他的举止中带有一种默默恳求的意味，好像他乞求的陪伴就是一种施舍。而他的脸上带着一种心照不宣的感激，好像我不拒绝他，他就对我很感激了似的。</td>
		<td class="en">I never resumed the subject; for however much my curiosity might be aroused, I felt too true compassion for his sufferings to increase them by my intrusion.I sought various ways to divert his mind, and to arouse him from the constant meditations in which he was plunged.He saw my efforts, and seconded them as far as in his power, for there was nothing moody or wayward in his nature; on the contrary, there was something frank, generous, unassuming, in his whole deportment.All the sentiments that he uttered were noble and lofty.He claimed no indulgence; he asked no toleration.He seemed content to carry his load of misery in silence, and only sought to carry it by my side.There was a mute beseeching manner about him, as if he craved companionship as a charitable boon; and a tacit thankfulness in his looks, as if he felt grateful to me for not repulsing him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我感到他的忧郁是有传染性的。这种忧郁渐渐控制了我的精神，扰乱了我所有的对快乐的追求，并逐渐让我的生活陷入痛苦中，可既然有一个人似乎完全依赖于我，那我也就无法将他甩开。事实上，从他的忧郁中散发出来的慷慨品质早已深入我的心。他的捐赠是慷慨而大方的。他的慈善是感人而自发的。但这不仅限于捐款，因为捐款一方面给人救济，但另一方面也给人羞辱。他的声调，他的眼神，增加了每一份礼物的价值，可怜的乞讨者为眼前难得的和蔼的仁慈而吃惊，因为这不仅是行动的仁慈，更是心的仁慈。事实上，他的慷慨好像含有自卑和赎罪的意味。他在乞讨者面前，在某种程度上，放低了自己的姿态。“当无辜的人还在痛苦和贫苦中挣扎的时候，”他常常自言自语道，“我还有什么权利享受安逸富裕的生活呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">I felt this melancholy to be infectious.It stole over my spirits; Interfered with all my gay pursuits, and gradually saddened my life; yet I could not prevail upon myself to shake off a being who seemed to hang upon me for support.In truth, the generous traits of character that beamed through all this gloom had penetrated to my heart.His bounty was lavish and open-handed.His charity melting and spontaneous.Not confined to mere donations, which often humiliate as much as they relieve.The tone of his voice, the beam of his eye, enhanced every gift, and surprised the poor suppliant with that rarest and sweetest of charities, the charity not merely of the hand, but of the heart.Indeed, his liberality seemed to have something in it of self-abasement and expiation.He humbled himself, in a manner, before the mendicant.“What right have I to ease and affluence,” would he murmur to himself, “when innocence wanders in misery and rags?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >狂欢节到了。我原本期望各种欢快的表演会让他高兴一些。我和他一起在圣马克广场拥挤的人群中游逛。我们经常去看歌剧，参加假面舞会和正式舞会。一切都是白费功夫。他的毛病越来越严重，他变得越来越憔悴，越来越焦躁。经常，我们从一场狂欢中回来之后，我走进他的房间，就看见他面朝下趴在沙发上：手里抓着自己的秀发，整个脸上都是胡思乱想的神情。</td>
		<td class="en">The Carnival time arrived.I had hoped that the gay scenes which then Presented themselves might have some cheering effect.I mingled with him in the motley throng that crowded the place of St. Mark.We frequented operas, masquerades, balls.All in vain.The evil kept growing on him; he became more and more haggard and agitated.Often, after we had returned from one of these scenes of revelry, I have entered his room, and found him lying on his face on the sofa: his hands clinched in his fine hair, and his whole countenance bearing traces of the convulsions of his mind.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >狂欢节过去了，接着是四旬斋，然后就是受难周。有天晚上，我们到一所教堂参加一场庄严的仪式。仪式中，有人在乐器的伴奏下唱了一大段关于救世主的死亡的曲子。</td>
		<td class="en">The Carnival passed away; the season of Lent succeeded; Passion week arrived.We attended one evening a solemn service in one of the churches; in the course of which a grand piece of vocal and instrumental music was performed relating to the death of our Saviour.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我之前说过他经常会受到音乐的影响，而这一次，他所受的影响非常之大。随着跳动的音符在柔软的走廊间穿过，他似乎被热情点燃。他的眼睛上翻，直到整个黑眼珠都看不见了；他的手紧紧地叉在一起，手指上都留下了深深的印迹。当音乐表达出临死的痛苦时，他把头慢慢埋到两膝间；当听到教堂中回响着“耶稣死了”这几个令人感伤的字符时，他忍不住呜咽起来。我从没见过他哭，他一向是只痛苦不悲伤的。我以为这是个好兆头，就让他不受打扰地尽情哭吧。仪式结束之后，我们离开了教堂。回家路上，他挽着我的胳膊，动作更轻更加服从，而不是我常见到的那副紧张不安的样子。他提起我们刚听到的音乐。“音乐”，他说，“实际上是天堂的呼唤。在我听到过的所有救世主赎罪的故事中，这个是最感人的。是啊，我的朋友，”他说着，把双手高兴地紧扣在一起，“我知道我们的救世主还活着！”</td>
		<td class="en">I had remarked that he was always powerfully affected by music; on this occasion he was so in an extraordinary degree.As the peeling notes swelled through the lofty aisles, he seemed to kindle up with fervor.His eyes rolled upwards, until nothing but the whites were visible; his hands were clasped together, until the fingers were deeply imprinted in the flesh.When the music expressed the dying agony, his face gradually sunk upon his knees; and at the touching words resounding through the church, “Jesu mori,” sobs burst from him uncontrolled.I had never seen him weep before; his had always been agony rather than sorrow.I augured well from the circumstance. I let him weep on uninterrupted.When the service was ended we left the church.He hung on my arm as we walked homewards, with something of a softer and more subdued manner; instead of that nervous agitation I had been accustomed to witness.He alluded to the service we had heard.“Music,” said he, “is indeed the voice of heaven; never before have I felt more impressed by the story of the atonement of our Saviour. Yes, my friend,” said he, clasping his hands with a kind of transport, “I know that my Redeemer liveth.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >晚上我们就分开了。他的房间离我的不远，我听能到他在房里忙了一阵。我睡着了，但是天还没亮就被叫醒了。这个年轻人站在我的床边，一身旅行的装扮。他手里拿着一个封口的包裹和一个大包裹，放到了我的桌上。“永别了，我的朋友，”他说，“我要踏上一个漫长的旅途了。不过临行前，我要把这些东西留给你。在这个包裹里你会了解我全部的经历。当你读着那些的时候，我已经在很远的地方了。请不要带着厌恶来回忆我。你，确实，是我的朋友。你抚慰了我受伤的心——但却无法使它愈合——永别了——让我吻吻你的手吧——我没资格拥抱你。”</td>
		<td class="en">We parted for the night.His room was not far from mine, and I heard him for some time busied in it.I fell asleep, but was awakened before daylight.The young man stood by my bed-side, dressed for travelling.He held a sealed packet and a large parcel in his hand, which he laid on the table.“Farewell, my friend,” said he, “I am about to set forth on a long journey; but, before I go, I leave with you these remembrances.In this packet you will find the particulars of my story.When you read them, I shall be far away; do not remember me with aversion.You have been, indeed, a friend to me.You have poured oil into a broken heart,—but you could not heal it.—Farewell—let me kiss your hand—I am unworthy to embrace you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他跪了下来，尽管我努力挣脱但他还是抓住了我的手，并吻了起来。见到这场景我惊呆了，连话都说不出来。</td>
		<td class="en">He sunk on his knees, seized my hand in despite of my efforts to the contrary, and covered it with kisses.I was so surprised by all this scene that I had not been able to say a word.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但咱们还是会再见面的。我看着他匆忙走向门口的时候，赶紧说道。</td>
		<td class="en">But we shall meet again, said I, hastily, as I saw him hurrying towards the door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不要——在这个世界上再也别见了！”他郑重地说。他再一次跳到我床边——抓起我的手，贴到他的心口和唇边，然后冲出了房间。</td>
		<td class="en">“Never—never in this world!” said he, solemnly.He sprang once more to my bedside—seized my hand, pressed it to his heart and to his lips, and rushed out of the room.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >说到这里，准男爵停了停。他似乎沉浸在思考中，坐在那里看着地板，用手指敲着椅子的扶手。</td>
		<td class="en">Here the Baronet paused.He seemed lost in thought, and sat looking upon the floor and drumming with his fingers on the arm of his chair.</td></tr>
