		<td class="en">The king would have preferred his choosing a friend from the pages who were brought up at court; but the prince would have nothing to say to them, and as he was a spoilt child, and allowed his way in all things, and the gardener’s boy was quiet and well-behaved, he was suffered to be in the palace, morning, noon, and night.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >夜幕降临时，他们就躺下来睡觉，把背包放在头下当枕头。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，我倒认为他不会抢劫我们！”男孩说。等男人走近了，男孩把自己的遭遇告诉了他们，陌生男人对此非常感兴趣，便请求与他们同行，认为自己也许能派上用场。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Oh, I don’t think he will rob us!’ said the boy; and when the man drew near, he told them his story, which so much interested the stranger that he asked leave to travel with them, as he might be of some use.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是，当太阳升起时，他们又出发了，狐狸依旧走在前面，男人和男孩紧随其后。</td>
		<td class="en">So when the sun rose they set out again, the fox in front as before, the man and boy following.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >几个小时后，他们到达了太阳妹妹的城堡，太阳妹妹养着许多宠物，其中就包括金鸡。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我认为最好是让我进去偷金鸡。”狐狸说；但男孩对此并不赞成。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I think it would be best for me to enter and steal the hens,’ said the fox; but this did not please the boy at all.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，这是我的事情，应该由我去。”他接上狐狸的话。</td>
		<td class="en">‘No, it is my business, so it is right that I should go,’ answered he.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你会发现要捉到金鸡是很难的。”狐狸回答说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘You will find it a very difficult matter to get hold of the hens,’ replied the fox.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，包在我身上，绝不会有闪失。”男孩答道。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Oh, nothing is likely to happen to me,’ returned the boy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好吧，那就去吧，”狐狸说，“但是务必小心，千万别出什么差错。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Well, go then,’ said the fox, ‘but be careful not to make any mistake.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Steal only the hen which has the feather missing from her tail, and leave the others alone.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >男人听着他们说话，并没有插嘴。于是，男孩走进了城堡的院子。</td>
		<td class="en">The man listened, but did not interfere, and the boy entered the court of the palace.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >很快，他就看见三只骄傲的金鸡趾高气扬地踱来踱去，其实它们正焦急地寻找着地上是否有供它们享用的谷物。</td>
		<td class="en">He soon spied the three hens strutting proudly about, though they were really anxiously wondering if there were not some grains lying on the ground that they might be glad to eat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当最后一只金鸡从男孩身边走过时，他发现它的尾巴上正好少了一根羽毛。</td>
		<td class="en">And as the last one passed by him, he saw she had one feather missing from her tail.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >男孩见状立即向前扑去，抓住了金鸡的脖子，这样金鸡就不能挣扎了。</td>
		<td class="en">At this sight the youth darted forward and seized the hen by the neck so that she could not struggle.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后，他将金鸡稳妥地夹在胳膊下，径直朝大门走去。</td>
		<td class="en">Then, tucking her comfortably under his arm, he made straight for the gate.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不幸的是，就在他即将走出大门时，他却回头看了一眼，从一扇敞开的门内瞥见了城堡里那宏伟壮观的景象。</td>
		<td class="en">Unluckily, just as he was about to go through it he looked back and caught a glimpse of wonderful splendours from an open door of the palace.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“反正也不着急走，”男孩心里嘀咕着，“既然已经来了，不妨进去瞧瞧。”于是他转过身，把金鸡忘得一干二净，金鸡就趁机从男孩的胳膊下逃走，跑去找自己的同伴们了。</td>
		<td class="en">‘After all, there is no hurry,’ he said to himself; ‘I may as well see something now I AM here,’ and turned back, forgetting all about the hen, which escaped from under his arm, and ran to join her sisters.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从门口窥视到的一切美丽事物深深地吸引了男孩，他几乎都没注意到自己已经丢了战利品。当他看到睡在自己跟前床上的太阳妹妹时，他都忘了世上还有金鸡这回事。</td>
		<td class="en">He was so much fascinated by the sight of all the beautiful things which peeped through the door that he scarcely noticed that he had lost the prize he had won; and he did not remember there was such a thing as a hen in the world when he beheld the Sister of the Sun sleeping on a bed before him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他痴痴地站着看了好一会儿，然后才猛然醒过神来，意识到自己在那里没什么事情可做，便悄悄溜走了，并再次幸运地抓住了那只金鸡，把它带到了大门口。</td>
		<td class="en">For some time he stood staring; then he came to himself with a start, and feeling that he had no business there, softly stole away, and was fortunate enough to recapture the hen, which he took with him to the gate.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是，他再次转身，走进寝宫，金鸡也像上次那样，扭动着身子逃走了。</td>
		<td class="en"> And he turned back for the second time and entered the chamber, while the hen wriggled herself free as before.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >男孩看后，心满意足，才走进院子又捉住了正在找玉米的金鸡。</td>
		<td class="en">When he had gazed his fill he went out into the courtyard and picked up his hen who was seeking for corn.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >走近大门口时，他又停了下来。</td>
		<td class="en">As he drew near the gate he paused.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我为什么没吻她一下呢？”他自言自语，“我永远都不会亲吻到如此美丽的姑娘了。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Why did I not give her a kiss?’ he said to himself; ‘I shall never kiss any woman so beautiful.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他懊悔地搓着手，所以金鸡落在地上又逃走了。</td>
		<td class="en">And he wrung his hands with regret, so that the hen fell to the ground and ran away.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不过我还是可以这么做的！”他兴奋地叫道，匆匆回到寝宫，在熟睡的少女的额头上吻了一下。</td>
		<td class="en">‘But I can do it still!’ he cried with delight, and he rushed back to the chamber and kissed the sleeping maiden on the forehead.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >唉，可是当他再次出来时，他发现那只金鸡已经变得十分警觉，不让自己靠近它。</td>
		<td class="en">But, alas! when he came out again he found that the hen had grown so shy that she would not let him come near her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而且，更糟糕的是，金鸡的同伴们开始咯咯咯地大声叫起来，太阳妹妹都被吵醒了。</td>
		<td class="en">And, worse than that, her sisters began to cluck so loud that the Sister of the Sun was awakened by the noise.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她急急忙忙地从床上跳起来，走到门口，对男孩说：</td>
		<td class="en">She jumped up in haste from her bed, and going to the door she said to the boy:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“如果你不能从那个很远的城堡里，把我那被巨人掳走的姐姐救出来的话，你将永远、永远得不到我的金鸡。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘You shall never, never, have my hen till you bring me back my sister who was carried off by a giant to his castle, which is a long way off.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >男孩慢慢地离开了城堡，心里十分难过，他把事情的经过告诉了等在大门口的同伴们，告诉他们他是如何三次抓到金鸡，却最后还是让给它跑了。</td>
		<td class="en">Slowly and sadly the youth left the palace and told his story to his friends, who were waiting outside the gate, how he had actually held the hen three times in his arms and had lost her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我早就知道，我们不会那么容易就逃脱掉的，”狐狸摇了摇头，说道，“但是时间紧迫，耽误不得。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I knew that we should not get off so easily,’ said the fox, shaking his head; ‘but there is no more time to waste.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们赶紧出发，去找太阳妹妹的姐姐。</td>
		<td class="en">Let us set off at once in search of the sister.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >幸好我认识路。”</td>
		<td class="en">Luckily, I know the way.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们连续走了许多天，直到最后，一如既往在前面领路的狐狸突然停下来。</td>
		<td class="en">They walked on for many days, till at length the fox, who, as usual, was going first, stopped suddenly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“巨人的城堡就在不远处，”它说，“但我们到那儿之后，你们俩必须留在外面，而我进去救出公主。</td>
		<td class="en">‘The giant’s castle is not far now,’ he said, ‘but when we reach it you two must remain outside while I go and fetch the princess.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我一把她带出来，你们就必须抓紧她，跑得越快越好。我则返回城堡，去和那些巨人们周旋——因为他们人很多——所以也许不会注意到公主已经逃跑了。”</td>
		<td class="en">Directly I bring her out you must both catch hold of her tight, and get away as fast as you can; while I return to the castle and talk to the giants—for there are many of them—so that they may not notice the escape of the princess.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >几分钟后，他们来到了城堡，狐狸以前经常去那里，所以轻而易举地就溜了进去。</td>
		<td class="en">A few minutes later they arrived at the castle, and the fox, who had often been there before, slipped in without difficulty.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >大厅里有好几个巨人，有老有少，都正围着公主跳着舞。</td>
		<td class="en">There were several giants, both young and old, in the hall, and they were all dancing round the princess.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">‘Ah, that is delightful; we want something new,’ answered they, and placed the princess between the outstretched arms of the fox.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一眨眼的工夫，狐狸就撞倒了大厅内用于照明的一大排灯盏，在黑暗中将公主带到了大门口。</td>
