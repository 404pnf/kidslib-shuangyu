		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天早晨，我站在寓所的弧形凸肚窗旁边俯瞰下面的街道。“福尔摩斯，”我开口说道，“有个疯子正在下面的街道上跑呢。他的家人竟然让他单独出门，真是太凄惨啦。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Holmes, ” said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street, “here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我朋友懒洋洋地从扶手椅上站了起来，双手插在睡袍的口袋里，隔着我的肩头往下方张望。这是个晴朗清新的二月早晨，昨天的雪依然厚厚地铺在地面，在冬日的阳光之中熠熠生辉。来往的马车在贝克街的街心犁出了一道满是碎屑的褐色沟槽，主路边缘和人行道的凸起街沿则依然是银装素裹，光景一如下雪之时。经过清扫的人行道露出了原来的灰色，走在上面却还是非常容易跌跤，这样一来，街上的行人就不像平时那么多。实际上，从地铁车站[^2]那边过来的行人只有一个，也就是那位行止古怪得让我不能不予以注意的绅士。</td>
		<td class="en">My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那人大概五十岁左右，又高又胖，块头大得引人注目，宽大的脸膛棱角分明，整个人显得气派非凡。他的衣着十分庄重，同时又相当奢华，其中包括一件黑色的礼服大衣、一顶光闪闪的礼帽、一双款式优雅的褐色长统松紧靴，以及一条裁剪精良的珠灰色长裤。另一方面，他的举止却与他威仪十足的打扮和长相形成了一种滑稽可笑的对比，因为他正在拼命奔跑，中间还时不时地往上蹿一蹿，腿脚完全不习惯奔波劳碌的人跑得累了，表现就是他这个样子。奔跑的过程当中，他的双手像抽风似地上上下下抖个不停，脑袋摇来晃去，面容也扭曲到了匪夷所思的程度。</td>
		<td class="en">He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearlgrey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他究竟有什么事情呢？”我问道。“他还在看房子的门牌号码哩。”</td>
		<td class="en">“What on earth can be the matter with him?” I asked. “He is looking up at the numbers of the houses.” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“依我看，他是要上咱们这儿来，”福尔摩斯摩拳擦掌地说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“I believe that he is coming here,” said Holmes, rubbing his hands.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“咱们这儿？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Here?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没错，而且我认为，他来的目的多半是找我咨询专业上的事情。要我说，我认得出他身上的那些征候。哈！我没说错吧？”他话音未落，那人已经呼哧呼哧地冲到了我们的家门口，把门铃拉得咣啷啷响彻整座房屋。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! Did I not tell you?” As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >片刻之后，他已经走进了我们的房间，依然气喘吁吁、依然双手乱舞。可是，他眼睛里的悲哀与绝望实在是太过凝重，我们脸上的笑意立刻变成了心里的惊骇与怜悯。有那么一小会儿，他根本说不出话，只是一个劲儿地在那里摇晃身子、拉扯头发，似乎他的理性已经被逼到了崩溃的边缘。接下来，他突然身子一纵，开始用自个儿的脑袋去撞墙壁，力道大得让我俩不得不赶紧冲了过去，把他拖到了房间中央。再下来，歇洛克·福尔摩斯把他摁进了那张安乐椅，然后就坐在他的身边，拍了拍他的手，开始用自己无比擅长的那种舒缓安神的语调跟他交谈。</td>
		<td class="en">A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您来是想跟我讲您的事情，对吧？”福尔摩斯说道，“您走得这么匆忙，一定是累坏了吧。您先歇会儿，好让自己缓过劲儿来，到时候，不管您把什么样的小小问题交给我，我都会非常乐意帮您解决。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?” said he. “You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >来人静静地坐了一分多钟，胸脯起伏不停，努力控制着自己的情绪。这之后，他掏出手帕擦了擦自己的额头，紧紧地绷住嘴唇，把脸转向了我俩这边。</td>
		<td class="en">The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你们肯定是觉得我疯了吧？”他说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“No doubt you think me mad?” said he.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我觉得您肯定是遇上了非常大的麻烦，”福尔摩斯回答道。</td>
		<td class="en">“I see that you have had some great trouble,” responded Holmes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“老天作证，我确实遇上了麻烦！这麻烦无比突然，无比恐怖，足以把理性从我的脑子里驱赶出去。我可能得面对当众出丑的结局，尽管我这个人从来不曾有过品格上的污点。我还得承受家庭事务带来的折磨，这样的折磨虽然每个人都会有，可是，它跟前面那件事情加在一起，具体的形式又是如此可怕，确实是让我失魂落魄。此外，有麻烦的还不只是我自己，如果不能从这件骇人听闻的事情当中找到一条出路的话，我们这片土地上最尊贵的人物也会受到牵累的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“God knows I have!—A trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您千万得冷静下来，先生，”福尔摩斯说道，“好让我知道您是谁，遇上的麻烦又是什么。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Pray compose yourself, sir,” said Holmes, “and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我的名字，”我们的客人回答道，“你们兴许会觉得耳熟。我是亚历山大·霍尔德，在针线街的霍尔德-史蒂文森银行任职。”</td>
		<td class="en">“My name,” answered our visitor, “is probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这名字我俩确实非常熟悉，因为名字的主人是故城里第二大私人银行集团的主要合伙人。那么，能够让伦敦的一位头等公民沦落到如此凄惨的境地，究竟会是什么样的事情呢？我俩满心好奇地等着下文，不过，他又经过了一番挣扎，这才打起精神，开始讲述他的故事。</td>
		<td class="en">The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我觉得眼下的形势刻不容缓，”他说道，“所以呢，警局的那位督察刚刚建议我来寻求您的帮助，我就十万火急地赶到了这里。我觉得马车在这样的雪地里跑不快，所以就坐地铁到了贝克街，然后又徒步从车站那边冲了过来，结果就把自己搞得上气不接下气，因为我很少锻炼身体。现在我感觉已经好些了，接下来，我会尽量简单明了地把事情告诉你们。</td>
		<td class="en">“I feel that time is of value,” said he; “that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your cooperation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“当然，你们应该很清楚，要想让银行生意取得成功，我们一方面得为自己的资金找到回报丰厚的投资渠道，一方面还得多拉储户，增进与储户之间的关系。我们最赚钱的投资渠道之一就是出借贷款，前提是还款的保障无可挑剔。过去几年当中，我们的贷款业务非常兴旺，许多显贵家庭都用藏画、藏书或者贵重器皿作为抵押，从我们这里借走了大笔现款。</td>
		<td class="en">“It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“昨天上午，我在银行的办公室里坐着，一名职员给我送来了一张卡片。卡片上的名字把我吓了一跳，因为来找我的不是别人，正是——呃，照我看，即便是在你们面前，我仍然是少说为妙。我只能这么说，来人的名字在全世界都是家喻户晓，也是全英格兰最显赫、最高贵、最尊荣的名字之一。我感到受宠若惊，在他进来的时候也急于表白这样的心情，可他一上来就直奔主题，看架势是觉得手头的事情并不让人愉快，越早了结越好。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than—well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth—one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“‘霍尔德先生，’他说，‘我听说你们经常做贷款生意。’</td>
		<td class="en">“‘Mr. Holder,’ said he, ‘I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“‘只要有可靠的抵押，我们银行的确会做这样的生意，’我回答他。</td>
		<td class="en">“‘The firm does so when the security is good,’ I answered.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“‘我需要立刻拿到五万镑现金，’他说，‘这事情对我来说极端重要。当然，这不过是个区区之数，即便十倍于此，我也可以从朋友们那里借来。不过，我非常倾向于把它变成一件单纯的生意，而且要由我本人亲自经手。处在我的位置，你应该很容易理解，随便接受人家的恩惠并不明智。’</td>
		<td class="en">“‘It is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that I should have fifty thousand pounds at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one’s self under obligations.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“‘我能不能问一问，这笔款子您打算用多长时间呢？’我问他。</td>
		<td class="en">“‘For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?’ I asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“‘下周一我会有一大笔进账，到时就肯定会归还借款，再加上你们认为合适的任何利息。不过，最要紧的是，我必须立刻拿到这笔钱。’</td>
		<td class="en">“‘Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“‘不用您劳神多说，我也非常乐意从我私人的口袋里掏钱借给您，’我说，‘只不过，这么大的一份荣耀，我的口袋未免消受不起。另一方面，要是以银行的名义来做这件事情的话，我就必须对我的合伙人负责，照章采取所有的保障措施，即便是您，也不能够例外。’</td>
		<td class="en">“‘I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,’ said I, ‘were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that even in your case, every business like precaution should be taken.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“‘我倒是非常倾向于照章办事，’他一边说，一边把他放在椅子旁边的一只黑色的摩洛哥皮方盒子拿了起来。‘毫无疑问，你应该听说过绿宝石王冠吧？’</td>
		<td class="en">“‘I should much prefer to have it so,’ said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. ‘You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“‘听说过，它是整个帝国最宝贵的公共财产之一，’我说。</td>
		<td class="en">“‘One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,’ said I.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“‘的确如此。’他打开了盒子，盒子的衬里是柔软的肉色丝绒，安放在丝绒之上的正是他刚刚提到的那件稀世珍宝。‘这上面有三十九颗巨大的绿宝石，’他说道，‘黄金镂雕的价值也是无可估量。按照最保守的估计，这个王冠的价值也是我所借数目的两倍。我可以把它留在你这里，作为我的借款抵押。’</td>
		<td class="en">“‘Precisely.’ He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. ‘There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,’ said he, ‘and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我把那个贵重的宝盒捧在手里，看看它，又看看这位声名赫奕的主顾，心里多少有点儿犯难。</td>

		<td class="en">“‘Ample.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你得明白，霍尔德先生，这件事情充分证明了我对你的信任，信任来自我之前听说的关于你的一切情况。我对你的期望不仅仅是谨慎从事、防止关于此事的任何流言，更重要的是，你一定要万无一失地把这个王冠保管好，不用我说，你自己也应该知道，要是它有了什么闪失，无疑就意味着一桩千夫所指的巨大丑闻。任何伤损的后果都跟彻底遗失相去无几，因为世上没有能跟它们媲美的绿宝石，要想替换是不可能的事情。不过，把它留在你这里，我还是拥有充分的信心。周一上午，我亲自来取。’</td>
		<td class="en">“‘You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我看出这位主顾急于抽身，所以就没有再说什么，只是叫来我的出纳，吩咐他向主顾支付五十张一千镑的钞票[^3]。可是，再一次独坐在办公室里的时候，我看着桌上这只贵重的宝盒，禁不住觉得责任重大、诚惶诚恐。毫无疑问，王冠既然是国之重宝，任何闪失都会造成可怕的丑闻。当时我就已经开始后悔，觉得自己压根儿就不该同意保管这件东西。然而，事情至此已经无法改变，于是我把它锁进自己的私人保险柜，重新投入了自己的工作。</td>
		<td class="en">“Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more; but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty thousand-pound notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“黄昏时候，我突然觉得，要是把如此贵重的东西留在办公室里，实在不能算是小心谨慎。银行家的保险柜遭人撬窃的事情屡见不鲜，我的保险柜就能够例外吗？万一被人撬了的话，我的处境将会可怕到何种程度！因此我决定，接下来的几天里面，不管上班下班，我都要把这个盒子带在身边，不让它离开我伸手可及的范围。打定主意之后，我叫来一辆出租马车，带着宝盒回到了我在斯特里特姆街区的家里。我拿着它上了楼，又把它锁进了更衣室的衣橱，这才觉得呼吸顺畅了些。</td>
		<td class="en">“When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers’ safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好了，现在我打算说说我家里的情况，福尔摩斯先生，好让您对眼下的形势有一个全面的了解。我的马夫和听差都没有睡在我那座房子里，他们的情况可以略过不提。女仆当中有三个都已经跟了我好些年，可说是绝对忠诚可靠。另有一个名叫露西·帕尔的粗使丫头，虽然只来了几个月，但却拥有无可挑剔的品性证明[^4]，做事也总是让我感到称心满意。她长得非常漂亮，偶尔就会有一些仰慕她的人到我家附近来转悠。这一点让我们觉得美中不足，除此之外，无论从哪方面来说，我们都相信她是个非常不错的姑娘。</td>
		<td class="en">“And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes—a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“说真的，他会受乔治·伯恩韦尔爵士这种人的蛊惑，我倒是一点儿也不奇怪，因为他经常把爵士带到家里来，连我自己都很难抗拒爵士的翩翩风采。爵士比阿瑟大一些，从头到脚都是个谙熟世情的人物，什么地方都去过，什么事情都见过，口才非常好，仪表也十分出众。不过，他不在场的时候，我可以摆脱他那种迷人风度的影响，冷静地掂量他的为人。根据他愤世嫉俗的言辞，还有他落在我眼里的一些眼神，我断定他这个人完全不堪信任。我这么想，我的小玛丽也这么想，因为她身为女人，对他人的性情有一种敏锐的直觉。</td>
		<td class="en">“And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman’s quick insight into character.</td></tr>

I do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him.

You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered.

I confess that the guilt of the banker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes’s judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.</td></tr>

I passed along the tradesmen’s path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.</td></tr>

I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.</td></tr>

I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief, had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?</td></tr>

There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one.

I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held—a thousand pounds apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. ‘Why, dash it all!’ said he, ‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at £1000 apiece.
