		<td class="en">Then the animals assailed the ass for spoiling what could possibly have been a pleasure to them, on a mere suspicion that the picture was not beautiful, without any evidence that such was the case.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >驴子没有因此而焦虑，相反，他很平静。他说，有一个办法可以证明他自己和那只家猫谁对谁错。他会到那里朝那个洞里看一看，然后回来告诉大家他在那里发现了什么。</td>
