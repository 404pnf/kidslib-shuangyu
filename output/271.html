		<td class="en">by Nathaniel Hawthorne</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人们之所以叫他“小水仙”，是因为他天性像花一样，只爱做令人愉快的、惬意的事，不乐意付出一点辛劳。但是，当小水仙还是个小男孩的时候就离开了舒适的家；他的妈妈把它托付给了一位非常严厉的教师，人称“辛劳先生”。熟悉辛劳先生的人都坚称他是个非常可敬的人；他为孩子和大人们做的好事比世上任何人都多。当然，他活了这么久，足以做这么多善事。因为（如果关于他的故事都是真的话），他从亚当被逐出伊甸园的那天起，就已经活在这个世上了。</td>
		<td class="en">Daffydowndilly was so called because in his nature he resembled a flower, and loved to do only what was beautiful and agreeable, and took no delight in labor of any kind.But, while Daffydowndilly was yet a little boy, his mother sent him away from his pleasant home, and put him under the care of a very strict schoolmaster, who went by the name of Mr. Toil.Those who knew him best affirmed that this Mr. Toil was a very worthy character; and that he had done more good, both to children and grown people, than anybody else in the world.Certainly he had lived long enough to do a great deal of good; for, if all stories be true, he had dwelt upon earth ever since Adam was driven from the garden of Eden.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是，辛劳先生表情严肃、面貌丑陋，在那些总喜欢游手好闲的小男孩和大人们看来尤其如此；他的声音也很尖利；他的所有为人处事的方式和习惯似乎都让我们的朋友小水仙感到十分厌恶。这位可怕的老教师，整日不是坐在讲桌前监视学生的一举一动，就是拿着一根吓人的桦条教鞭在教室里踱来踱去。一会儿，辛劳先生发现一个男孩儿上课贪玩，就啪地敲一下他的肩膀；一会儿，他又体罚没能跟上功课的全班所有学生。总之，一个孩子除非能安安静静、一刻不停地看书，否则他绝不可能在辛劳先生的教室里享受片刻安宁。</td>
		<td class="en">Nevertheless, Mr. Toil had a severe and ugly countenance, especially for such little boys or big men as were inclined to be idle; his voice, too, was harsh; and all his ways and customs seemed very disagreeable to our friend Daffydowndilly.The whole day long, this terrible old schoolmaster sat at his desk overlooking the scholars, or stalked about the school-room with a certain awful birch rod in his hand.Now came a rap over the shoulders of a boy whom Mr. Toil had caught at play; now he punished a whole class who were behindhand with their lessons; and, in short, unless a lad chose to attend quietly and constantly to his book, he had no chance of enjoying a quiet moment in the school-room of Mr. Toil.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我可受不了这个。”小水仙心想。</td>
		<td class="en">“This will never do for me,” thought Daffydowndilly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在此之前，小水仙的生活从没离开过他亲爱的妈妈。妈妈的脸可比辛劳老先生温柔多了，而且她也一直十分溺爱自己的小儿子。因此，可怜的小水仙自然会觉得生活发生了悲惨的变化——他被迫从那位温柔善良的女士身边离开，又被托付给一个面貌丑陋的老师加以管教。这个老师从来没给过他苹果或者蛋糕，似乎认为小男孩们生来就只该去念书上课。</td>
		<td class="en">Now, the whole of Daffydowndilly’s life had hitherto been passed with his dear mother, who had a much sweeter face than old Mr. Toil, and who had always been very indulgent to her little boy.No wonder, therefore, that poor Daffydowndilly found it a woful change, to be sent away from the good lady’s side, and put under the care of this ugly-visaged schoolmaster, who never gave him any apples or cakes, and seemed to think that little boys were created only to get lessons.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我再也受不了了。”小水仙在学校呆了大概一周后，自言自语道，“我要离开这里，找我亲爱的妈妈。无论如何，我再也不会遇到有辛劳老先生一半讨厌的人了！”</td>
		<td class="en">“I can’t bear it any longer,” said Daffydowndilly to himself, when he had been at school about a week.“I’ll run away, and try to find my dear mother; and, at any rate, I shall never find anybody half so disagreeable as this old Mr. Toil!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是，就在第二天一大早，可怜的小水仙出发了，开始四处游荡。他只带了早餐吃的面包和奶酪，还带了一点儿零花钱以支付自己的开销。但是他还没走出多远就赶上了一个表情严肃、仪表端庄的男人。这人正不紧不慢地沿途跋涉。</td>
		<td class="en">So, the very next morning, off started poor Daffydowndilly, and began his rambles about the world, with only some bread and cheese for his breakfast, and very little pocket-money to pay his expenses.But he had gone only a short distance, when he overtook a man of grave and sedate appearance, who was trudging at a moderate pace along the road.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“早上好，漂亮的小家伙，”陌生人说，声音有些严厉，但语气中透出某种友善，“你这么早从哪里来？要到哪里去啊？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Good morning, my fine lad,” said the stranger; and his voice seemed hard and severe, but yet had a sort of kindness in it; “whence do you come so early, and whither are you going?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >小水仙是个非常坦率正直的男孩，长这么大还从来没有说过谎。这次他也实话实说了。他犹豫了片刻，不过最后还是坦白说了。他说自己非常讨厌辛劳先生，所以就从学校逃出来了，决心去一个再也见不到那个老先生，再也听不到他消息的地方。</td>
		<td class="en">Little Daffydowndilly was a boy of very ingenuous disposition, and had never been known to tell a lie in all his life.Nor did he tell one now.He hesitated a moment or two, but finally confessed that he had run away from school, on account of his great dislike to Mr. Toil; and that he was resolved to find some place in the world where he should never see or hear of the old schoolmaster again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，太好了，我的小朋友！”陌生人回答道，“那我们一起走吧，因为，我和你一样，也和辛劳先生有不少瓜葛，很想去一个没人知道他的地方。”</td>
		<td class="en">“O, very well, my little friend!” answered the stranger.“Then we will go together; for I, likewise, have had a good deal to do with Mr. Toil, and should be glad to find some place where he was never heard of.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对我们的朋友小水仙来说，如果能有一个与他年龄相当的伙伴同行就更好了；他们就可以沿着路边一起摘花，一起追蝴蝶，一起做很多事，这样旅行会很愉快。不过，他很聪明，他明白有一个阅历丰富的长者给他带路，闯荡世界的旅行会容易得多。于是他接受了陌生人的建议，两个人非常友好地一起前行。</td>
		<td class="en">Our friend Daffydowndilly would have been better pleased with a companion of his own age, with whom he might have gathered flowers along the roadside, or have chased butterflies, or have done many other things to make the journey pleasant.But he had wisdom enough to understand that he should get along through the world much easier by having a man of experience to show him the way.So he accepted the stranger’s proposal, and they walked on very sociably together.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们沿着这条路还没走多远就经过一片田地。田里有几个工人在制作干草；他们有的在割草，有的将草铺开，放在太阳下晒干。小水仙闻着新割的草散发的甜香，十分欣喜。他心想，和关在阴郁的教室一天到晚上课，不停地听辛劳老先生责骂相比，一边沐浴着灿烂的阳光，呆在蔚蓝的天空下，听着附近林中的鸟儿婉转歌唱，一边晒干草可要惬意多了。他边想边停下来向石墙那边瞄了一眼。可是，他突然猛地后退了几步，一把抓住同伴的手。</td>
		<td class="en">They had not gone far, when the road passed by a field where some haymakers were at work, mowing down the tall grass, and spreading it out in the sun to dry.Daffydowndilly was delighted with the sweet smell of the new-mown grass, and thought how much pleasanter it must be to make hay in the sunshine, under the blue sky, and with the birds singing sweetly in the neighboring trees and bushes, than to be shut up in a dismal school-room, learning lessons all day long, and continually scolded by old Mr. Toil.But, in the midst of these thoughts, while he was stopping to peep over the stone wall, he started back and caught hold of his companion’s hand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“快，快！”他喊道，“咱们得快跑，不然他会抓住我们的！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Quick, quick!” cried he.“Let us run away, or he will catch us!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“谁会抓我们？”陌生人问。</td>
		<td class="en">“Who will catch us?” asked the stranger.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“辛劳先生，那个老教师！”小水仙答道。“你没看见他就在制作干草的工人中间吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Mr. Toil, the old schoolmaster!” answered Daffydowndilly.“Don’t you see him amongst the haymakers?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >小水仙用手指向一个年长的男人，他好像是雇那些工人来干活的田主。他脱了外衣和马甲，只穿着衬衫在起劲地干活。他额头上大汗淋漓，但他一刻都不休息，不停地大声督促工人们趁着烈日当空，赶紧晒干草。说来奇怪，这个老农场主的身材和相貌简直和辛劳老先生一模一样，可是，此时此刻，辛劳先生应该刚好走进教室。</td>
		<td class="en">And Daffydowndilly pointed to an elderly man, who seemed to be the owner of the field, and the employer of the men at work there.He had stripped off his coat and waistcoat, and was busily at work in his shirt-sleeves.The drops of sweat stood upon his brow; but he gave himself not a moment’s rest, and kept crying out to the haymakers to make hay while the sun shone.Now, strange to say, the figure and features of this old farmer were precisely the same as those of old Mr. Toil, who, at that very moment, must have been just entering his school-room.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“别害怕，”陌生人说，“这不是你的老师辛劳先生，而是他的兄弟，他被培养成了农场主。人们都说他比辛劳先生还难相处。但是，他不会找你麻烦的，除非你是这个农场里的工人。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Don’t be afraid,” said the stranger.“This is not Mr. Toil the schoolmaster, but a brother of his, who was bred a farmer; and people say he is the most disagreeable man of the two.However, he won’t trouble you, unless you become a laborer on the farm.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >小水仙相信了同伴的话，但是尽管如此，直到那个酷似辛劳先生的人从他们的视线里消失后，他才又变得无比快活起来。两个人走了没多远，又来到一个地方，几个木匠正在建造房子。小水仙恳求他的同伴停一会儿，因为看木匠们娴熟地建房子是件非常赏心悦目的事。他们有的拿着宽斧，有的拉着锯子，有的拿着刨子和锤子；有的在做屋门，有的在装窗框，有的在钉墙板。他情不自禁地想，要是他也能拿着宽斧、锯子、刨子和锤子建造一座自己的房子就好了。如果他真有了属于自己的房子，辛劳老先生就再不敢来骚扰他了。</td>
		<td class="en">Little Daffydowndilly believed what his companion said, but was very glad, nevertheless, when they were out of sight of the old farmer, who bore such a singular resemblance to Mr. Toil.The two travellers had gone but little farther, when they came to a spot where some carpenters were erecting a house.Daffydowndilly begged his companion to stop a moment; for it was a very pretty sight to see how neatly the carpenters did their work, with their broad-axes, and saws, and planes, and hammers, shaping out the doors, and putting in the window-sashes, and nailing on the clapboards; and he could not help thinking that he should like to take a broad-axe, a saw, a plane, and a hammer, and build a little house for himself.And then, when he should have a house of his own, old Mr. Toil would never dare to molest him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，就在小水仙自我陶醉的时候，他忽然看到了什么，吓得一把抓住了同伴的手。</td>
		<td class="en">But, just while he was delighting himself with this idea, little Daffydowndilly beheld something that made him catch hold of his companion’s hand, all in a fright.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“快跑。快，快！”他喊道，“他又来了！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Make haste.Quick, quick!” cried he.“There he is again!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“谁？”陌生人平静地问。</td>
		<td class="en">“Who?” asked the stranger, very quietly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“辛劳老先生，”小水仙颤抖着说，“看那儿！他正在那儿监督木匠们干活呢。那个老头就是我的老师，我敢肯定！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Old Mr. Toil,” said Daffydowndilly, trembling.“There! he that is overseeing the carpenters.’T is my old schoolmaster, as sure as I’m alive!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >陌生人顺着小水仙指的方向望去，看到一位上了年纪的人，手里拿着一把工匠尺和一只圆规。这个人绕着尚未完工的房子走来走去，一会儿量量木条的长厚，一会儿标出还有多少活儿没干，还不停地督促其他木匠努力干活。他面容严峻，满脸皱纹。木匠们一看到他的脸，就仿佛感到有个监工在监视他们，于是拼了命一般地又锯又锤又刨。</td>
		<td class="en">The stranger cast his eyes where Daffydowndilly pointed his finger; and he saw an elderly man, with a carpenter’s rule and compasses in his hand.This person went to and fro about the unfinished house, measuring pieces of timber, and marking out the work that was to be done, and continually exhorting the other carpenters to be diligent.And wherever he turned his hard and wrinkled visage, the men seemed to feel that they had a task-master over them, and sawed, and hammered, and planed, as if for dear life.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，不！他不是你的老师辛劳先生，”陌生人说，“这是他的另一个兄弟，这人从事木匠行业。”</td>
		<td class="en">“O no! this is not Mr. Toil, the schoolmaster,” said the stranger.“It is another brother of his, who follows the trade of carpenter.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“听你这么说，我真高兴，”小水仙说，“不过，如果您愿意，先生，我想尽快离开这儿。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I am very glad to hear it,” quoth Daffydowndilly; “but if you please, sir, I should like to get out of his way as soon as possible.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是他们又接着往前走，不久就听到一阵敲鼓和吹横笛的声音。小水仙竖起耳朵听，请求同伴快点走，免得错过了目睹士兵的风采。于是，他们赶快加紧步伐，很快就看到一个连队的士兵；他们衣着鲜艳，帽子上插着漂亮的羽毛，肩上扛着亮闪闪的火枪。走在队伍最前面的是两个鼓手和两个吹笛手。他们用尽全力打着鼓，吹着横笛，以至于小水仙听着这欢快的乐声，简直想要追随他们到天涯海角了。小水仙心想，就算他只是个士兵，辛劳老先生也肯定不敢直视他。</td>
		<td class="en">Then they went on a little farther, and soon heard the sound of a drum and fife.Daffydowndilly pricked up his ears at this, and besought his companion to hurry forward, that they might not miss seeing the soldiers.Accordingly, they made what haste they could, and soon met a company of soldiers, gayly dressed, with beautiful feathers in their caps, and bright muskets on their shoulders.In front marched two drummers and two fifers, beating on their drums and playing on their fifes with might and main, and making such lively music that little Daffydowndilly would gladly have followed them to the end of the world.And if he was only a soldier, then, he said to himself, old Mr. Toil would never venture to look him in the face.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“加快脚步！前进！”一个嗓音粗哑的人喊道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Quick step! Forward march!” shouted a gruff voice.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >小水仙被吓了一跳，惊慌失措。因为这个跟士兵喊话的人的嗓音和他以前每天在辛劳先生的教室里听到的辛劳先生发出的声音一模一样。小水仙将目光投向这个连队的队长，映入眼帘的正是辛劳老先生的形象。他头戴一顶插着羽毛的时髦帽子，两肩佩戴着金色肩章，身穿一件镶有花边的外衣，腰间系着一条紫色腰带，手握的是一把长剑，而不是桦条教鞭。尽管他像一只雄火鸡那样昂首阔步，但看起来还是那么丑陋、那么令人讨厌，和他在教室里上课时一样。</td>
		<td class="en">Little Daffydowndilly started, in great dismay; for this voice which had spoken to the soldiers sounded precisely the same as that which he had heard every day in Mr. Toil’s school-room, out of Mr. Toil’s own mouth.And, turning his eyes to the captain of the company, what should he see but the very image of old Mr. Toil himself, with a smart cap and feather on his head, a pair of gold epaulets on his shoulders, a laced coat on his back, a purple sash round his waist, and a long sword, instead of a birch rod, in his hand.And though he held his head so high, and strutted like a turkey-cock, still he looked quite as ugly and disagreeable as when he was hearing lessons in the schoolroom.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这肯定是辛劳老先生，”小水仙颤抖着说，“咱们快跑吧，小心他把咱们拉进他的连队！”</td>
		<td class="en">“This is certainly old Mr. Toil,” said Daffydowndilly, in a trembling voice.“Let us run away, for fear he should make us enlist in his company!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你又认错了，我的小朋友，”陌生人非常镇静地说，“这不是辛劳老师，而是他的另一个兄弟，他一生都在军队里服役。人们都说他是个特别严肃的人，不过我们两个用不着怕他。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You are mistaken again, my little friend,” replied the stranger, very composedly.“This is not Mr. Toil, the schoolmaster, but a brother of his, who has served in the army all his life.People say he’s a terribly severe fellow; but you and I need not be afraid of him.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好吧，好吧，”小水仙说，“不过，如果你愿意，先生，我不想再看到那些士兵了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, well,” said little Daffydowndilly, “but, if you please, sir, I don’t want to see the soldiers any more.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是，孩子和陌生人继续他们的旅程，不久就来到了路边的一座房子；一群人正在那里尽情作乐。年轻的小伙子们和面色红润的姑娘们，正笑容满面地伴着小提琴的琴声翩翩起舞。这是小水仙见到的最愉快的画面了，使他之前所有的失望情绪得以安抚。</td>
		<td class="en">So the child and the stranger resumed their journey; and, by and by, they came to a house by the roadside, where a number of people were making merry.Young men and rosy-checked girls, with smiles on their faces, were dancing to the sound of a fiddle.It was the pleasantest sight that Daffydowndilly had yet met with, and it comforted him for all his disappointments.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“啊，我们就留在这儿吧，”他对同伴大声说，“因为，辛劳先生肯定不敢在有人拉小提琴、有人跳舞作乐的地方露面。我们在这里肯定安全！”</td>
		<td class="en">“O, let us stop here,” cried he to his companion; “for Mr. Toil will never dare to show his face where there is a fiddler, and where people are dancing and making merry.We shall be quite safe here!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是小水仙说最后这句话时，声音渐渐变弱了，因为他刚好瞥见了那个拉小提琴的人——再看一眼——竟然长得酷似辛劳先生：他手里拿着一只琴弓，而不是桦条教鞭；他拉起琴来轻松而娴熟，就好像他拉了一辈子小提琴似的！他长得有几分法国人的模样，但看着还是特别像那位老教师。小水仙甚至幻想着这人在向他点头，眨眼，并招呼他一起来跳舞。</td>
		<td class="en">But these last words died away upon Daffydowndilly’s tongue; for, happening to cast his eyes on the fiddler, whom should be behold again, but the likeness of Mr. Toil, holding a fiddle-bow instead of a birch rod, and flourishing it with as much ease and dexterity as if he had been a fiddler all his life!He had somewhat the air of a Frenchman, but still looked exactly like the old schoolmaster; and Daffydowndilly even fancied that he nodded and winked at him, and made signs for him to join in the dance.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，天啊！”他小声说，脸色变得苍白。“这个世界上好像除了辛劳先生就没别人了。谁会想到他在拉小提琴！”</td>
		<td class="en">“O dear me!” whispered he, turning pale.“It seems as if there was nobody but Mr. Toil in the world.Who could have thought of his playing on a fiddle!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他不是你的老教师，”陌生人说，“而是他的另一个兄弟，在法国长大，在那里学会了拉小提琴，并以此为职业。他为自己的家族感到耻辱，所以通常称自己为‘欢愉先生’。但是他的真名是‘辛劳’，那些了解他的人都觉得他比他的兄弟们更难相处。”</td>
		<td class="en">“This is not your old schoolmaster,” observed the stranger, “but another brother of his, who was bred in France, where he learned the profession of a fiddler.He is ashamed of his family, and generally calls himself Monsieur le Plaisir; but his real name is Toil, and those who have known him best think him still more disagreeable than his brothers.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“保佑我们离这儿远点儿吧，”小水仙说，“我一点儿都不喜欢那个小提琴手的模样。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Pray let us go a little farther,” said Daffydowndilly.“I don’t like the looks of this fiddler at all.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就这样，陌生人和小水仙继续沿着大路漫无目的地往前走。他们走过林阴小道，穿过恬静的村落；无论他们走到哪里，看吧！都会碰到和辛劳老先生长得一模一样的人。他就像竖立在玉米地里的稻草人。如果他们走进一栋房子，他就坐在客厅里；如果他们偷偷地往厨房里看，他又在厨房里。他闲适自在地呆在每一座农舍里，还变化着乔装打扮，偷偷溜进最富丽堂皇的豪宅里。无论走在哪里，都一定有个人长得像辛劳先生，不过陌生人总说那只是老先生无数兄弟们中的一个。</td>
		<td class="en">Well, thus the stranger and little Daffydowndilly went wandering along the highway, and in shady lanes, and through pleasant villages; and whithersoever they went, behold! there was the image of old Mr. Toil.He stood like a scarecrow in the cornfields.If they entered a house, he sat in the parlor; if they peeped into the kitchen, he was there.He made himself at home in every cottage, and stole, under one disguise or another, into the most splendid mansions.Everywhere there was sure to be somebody wearing the likeness of Mr. Toil, and who, as the stranger affirmed, was one of the old schoolmaster’s innumerable brethren.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >小水仙累得几乎筋疲力尽了，这时他看到一些人在路旁树阴下慵懒地躺着。可怜的孩子恳求他的同伴一起在那里坐下来休息一会儿。</td>
		<td class="en">Little Daffydowndilly was almost tired to death, when he perceived some people reclining lazily in a shady place, by the side of the road.The poor child entreated his companion that they might sit down there, and take some repose.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“辛劳老先生一定不会来这里的，”他说，“因为他讨厌看到别人安心休息。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Old Mr. Toil will never come here,” said he; “for he hates to see people taking their ease.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，就在小水仙说话的当口，他的目光忽然落到一个人身上。这人似乎是躺在树阴里睡觉的那群又懒又胖又迟钝的人里面最懒、最胖、最迟钝的一个。这人竟然又和辛劳先生长得一模一样！</td>
		<td class="en">But, even while he spoke, Daffydowndilly’s eyes fell upon a person who seemed the laziest, and heaviest, and most torpid of all those lazy and heavy and torpid people who had lain down to sleep in the shade.Who should it be, again, but the very image of Mr. Toil!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“辛劳家是个大家庭，”陌生人说，“这是老先生的又一个兄弟，他在意大利长大，在那里养成了一身懒散的毛病，人们都叫他‘慵懒先生’。他装出一副生活舒适安逸的样子，其实是大家庭里过得最糟糕的一个。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There is a large family of these Toils,” remarked the stranger.“This is another of the old schoolmaster’s brothers, who was bred in Italy, where he acquired very idle habits, and goes by the name of Signor Far Niente.He pretends to lead an easy life, but is really the most miserable fellow in the family.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，带我回去吧！带我回去吧！”可怜的小水仙失声痛哭起来，大喊道，“如果这世上到处都是辛劳先生，我还不如回学校去！”</td>
		<td class="en">“O, take me back!—take me back!” cried poor little Daffydowndilly, bursting into tears.“If there is nothing but Toil all the world over, I may just as well go back to the school-house!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“就在那儿——那儿不就是学校嘛！”陌生人说；尽管他和小水仙走了不少路，但是他们没走直线，只是绕了一圈又回来了。“来，我们一起回学校去吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yonder it is,—there is the school-house!” said the stranger; for though he and little Daffydowndilly had taken a great many steps, they had travelled in a circle, instead of a straight line.“Come; we will go back to school together.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >此时，小水仙想起他同伴的声音有些似曾相识；奇怪的是，他早先怎么没想起来呢。他抬头看看他的脸，瞧！居然又和辛劳老先生长得一样。尽管这个可怜的孩子拼命要离开辛劳先生，谁料却和他呆了整整一天。有些人听我讲述完小水仙的故事后，以为辛劳老先生是个魔法师，拥有分身术的法力，只要他认为身形合适，就能随意附体。</td>
		<td class="en">There was something in his companion’s voice that little Daffydowndilly now remembered; and it is strange that he had not remembered it sooner.Looking up into his face, behold! there again was the likeness of old Mr. Toil; so that the poor child had been in company with Toil all day, even while he was doing his best to run away from him.Some people, to whom I have told little Daffydowndilly’s story, are of opinion that old Mr. Toil was a magician, and possessed the power of multiplying himself into as many shapes as he saw fit.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就算如此吧，总之，小水仙吸取了一次很好的教训，自此以后开始勤奋学习，因为他知道，勤奋一点儿也不比玩乐和懒散更辛劳。而且，和辛劳先生日渐熟悉以后，小水仙开始觉得他为人处事其实也没那么讨厌。当先生的脸上露出赞许的微笑时，他看上去几乎和小水仙的妈妈一样和蔼可亲。</td>
		<td class="en">Be this as it may, little Daffydowndilly had learned a good lesson, and from that time forward was diligent at his task, because he knew that diligence is not a whit more toilsome than sport or idleness.And when he became better acquainted with Mr. Toil, he began to think that his ways were not so very disagreeable, and that the old schoolmaster’s smile of approbation made his face almost as pleasant as even that of Daffydowndilly’s mother.</td></tr>
