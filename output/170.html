		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这是摩根森的最后一块熏肉了。他这一辈子就从来没有放纵地大吃过。实际上，他的饭量很小，几乎可以忽略不计，他也就很少为吃饭而烦扰，更不会去想什么。可是现在，因为好久都没有那种习以为常的饱腹感了，咸味很重的熏肉勾起了他强烈的食欲。</td>
		<td class="en">It was the last of Morganson’s bacon.In all his life he had never pampered his stomach.In fact, his stomach had been a sort of negligible quantity that bothered him little, and about which he thought less.But now, in the long absence of wonted delights, the keen yearning of his stomach was tickled hugely by the sharp, salty bacon.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他面露饥色，一脸渴望。脸颊凹陷下去，皮肤似乎贴在颧骨上，稍微有些紧绷。一双淡蓝色的眼睛显得心事重重。他的眼神中透着不安，昭示着有可怕的事情迫近。眼神里有疑惑，有焦虑，也有不祥之兆。原本就薄的嘴唇抿得更薄了，似乎在渴求着擦亮的煎锅。</td>
		<td class="en">His face had a wistful, hungry expression.The cheeks were hollow, and the skin seemed stretched a trifle tightly across the cheek-bones.His pale blue eyes were troubled.There was that in them that showed the haunting imminence of something terrible.Doubt was in them, and anxiety and foreboding.The thin lips were thinner than they were made to be, and they seemed to hunger towards the polished frying-pan.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他坐下来，拿出烟袋。他仔细朝烟袋锅里看了看，将烟灰全都磕在了摊开的手掌里。他将海豹皮的烟袋翻了过来，掸了掸里子，费劲收集到的每一片每一点烟叶他都视如珍宝。可是只弄到了一丁点。他搜了搜兜里，拇指和食指只捏了撮废渣上来。废渣中散布着些烟草屑。他十分仔细地将烟草屑分出来，不过偶尔也会允许手掌里堆聚起一些烟草中混入的杂物。他甚至有意放进去些小小的、半软半硬的羊绒毛，它们起初是从大衣的衬里上掉下来的，在兜底呆了也有好几个月了。</td>
		<td class="en">He sat back and drew forth a pipe.He looked into it with sharp scrutiny, and tapped it emptily on his open palm.He turned the hair-seal tobacco pouch inside out and dusted the lining, treasuring carefully each flake and mite of tobacco that his efforts gleaned.The result was scarce a thimbleful.He searched in his pockets, and brought forward, between thumb and forefinger, tiny pinches of rubbish.Here and there in this rubbish were crumbs of tobacco.These he segregated with microscopic care, though he occasionally permitted small particles of foreign substance to accompany the crumbs to the hoard in his palm.He even deliberately added small, semi-hard woolly fluffs, that had come originally from the coat lining, and that had lain for long months in the bottoms of the pockets.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一刻钟后，他终于把烟袋锅装满了。他借着篝火把烟点着，然后往前挪了挪坐到毯子上，一边暖和着鹿皮鞋里的脚，一边吝惜地抽着每一口烟。烟袋抽完了，他依旧坐在那里，看着将要燃尽的篝火陷入了沉思。焦虑慢慢从他眼里散去，取而代之的是下定决心的神情。他命途多舛，可最后还是想法子一路走了下来。可是路途艰辛。他的脸变得严肃凶狠起来，薄薄的嘴唇绷得很紧。</td>
		<td class="en">At the end of fifteen minutes he had the pipe part filled.He lighted it from the camp fire, and sat forward on the blankets, toasting his moccasined feet and smoking parsimoniously.When the pipe was finished he sat on, brooding into the dying flame of the fire.Slowly the worry went out of his eyes and resolve came in.Out of the chaos of his fortunes he had finally achieved a way.But it was not a pretty way.His face had become stern and wolfish, and the thin lips were drawn very tightly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有了决心就有了行动。他僵硬地站起身来，开始收帐篷。他将卷好的毯子、煎锅、步枪和斧子都收拾到雪橇上，又拿绳子把这堆东西捆好。接着他在篝火上烤了烤手，戴上了连指手套。他的脚很疼，往雪橇前面走的时候跛得厉害。他把绳套背到肩上，俯身向前抻着绳子拉动雪橇时，脸抽动了一下。拉了这么多天绳子，他肩上的肉给磨破了。</td>
		<td class="en">With resolve came action.He pulled himself stiffly to his feet and proceeded to break camp.He packed the rolled blankets, the frying-pan, rifle, and axe on the sled, and passed a lashing around the load.Then he warmed his hands at the fire and pulled on his mittens.He was foot-sore, and limped noticeably as he took his place at the head of the sled.When he put the looped haul-rope over his shoulder, and leant his weight against it to start the sled, he winced.His flesh was galled by many days of contact with the haul-rope.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这条小路顺着结了冰的育空河向前延伸。走了四个钟头后，他拐了个弯，走进了明托镇。镇子就坐落在堤岸高处的一块空地上，客栈酒馆各一家，还有几座小屋。他把雪橇留在门口就进了酒馆。</td>
		<td class="en">The trail led along the frozen breast of the Yukon.At the end of four hours he came around a bend and entered the town of Minto.It was perched on top of a high earth bank in the midst of a clearing, and consisted of a road house, a saloon, and several cabins.He left his sled at the door and entered the saloon.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“够喝一杯的吧？”他问道，一边把一个装金子的袋子搁在吧台上，但里面明显没什么分量。</td>
		<td class="en">“Enough for a drink?” he asked, laying an apparently empty gold sack upon the bar.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >酒保敏锐地看了看袋子，又看了看他，然后拿出一瓶酒和一只杯子。</td>
		<td class="en">The barkeeper looked sharply at it and him, then set out a bottle and a glass.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“金末就算了吧。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“Never mind the dust,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你就收下吧。”摩根森还是坚持。</td>
		<td class="en">“Go on and take it,” Morganson insisted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >酒保把钱袋口朝下，冲着天平的托盘抖了抖，薄薄的一层金末落了出来。摩根森从他手里接过钱袋，把里子翻过来，小心翼翼地抖着金末。</td>
		<td class="en">The barkeeper held the sack mouth downward over the scales and shook it, and a few flakes of gold dust fell out.Morganson took the sack from him, turned it inside out, and dusted it carefully.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我还以为里面得有半美元呢。”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I thought there was half-a-dollar in it,” he said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不太够，”另一个人回答说，“不过也差不多了。我会从下个客人那儿补齐的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Not quite,” answered the other, “but near enough.I’ll get it back with the down weight on the next comer.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >摩根森不好意思地把威士忌倒进杯子里，还没全倒满。</td>
		<td class="en">Morganson shyly poured the whisky into the glass, partly filling it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“倒啊，得够个男人喝的呀。”酒保给他鼓着劲。</td>
		<td class="en">“Go on, make it a man’s drink,” the barkeeper encouraged.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >摩根森把瓶子一歪，酒就齐到了杯沿。他慢慢喝着酒，享受着舌头上灼热的感觉，酒火辣辣地穿过喉咙，在胃里弥漫开来，那感觉又温暖又轻柔。</td>
		<td class="en">Morganson tilted the bottle and filled the glass to the brim.He drank the liquor slowly, pleasuring in the fire of it that bit his tongue, sank hotly down his throat, and with warm, gentle caresses permeated his stomach.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“坏血病，嗯？”酒保问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Scurvy, eh?” the barkeeper asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“有点儿，”他回答说，“不过我身子还没肿。或许我能到戴依去弄点儿新鲜蔬菜，治好这病。”</td>
		<td class="en">“A touch of it,” he answered.“But I haven’t begun to swell yet.Maybe I can get to Dyea and fresh vegetables, and beat it out.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我得说，你差不多豁上一切了。”另一个人同情地笑着说，“没有狗，没有钱，还得了坏血病。我要是你就试试云杉茶。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Kind of all in, I’d say,” the other laughed sympathetically.“No dogs, no money, and the scurvy.I’d try spruce tea if I was you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >半个钟头过后，摩根森和酒保道别，离开了酒馆。他把绳套背到磨破了的肩头上，沿着河边的小路往南走。一个钟头后他停了下来。有块洼地引人注目，它位于河的右侧与河道成锐角的方向上。他放下雪橇，跛行了半英里走到洼地那儿。他和河之间有三百码宽的平地，那儿长着一片棉白杨。穿过棉白杨林，他来到育空河的河岸上。小路就在河岸下边，可他没有走下去。朝南面塞尔扣克的方向看去，小路在低洼的雪地中绵延了有一英里多，路面越来越宽。可是在往北通往明托的方向上，在离他四分之一英里远的地方，小路让河岸上突出的一片树丛给挡住了。</td>
		<td class="en">At the end of half-an-hour, Morganson said good-bye and left the saloon.He put his galled shoulder to the haul-rope and took the river-trail south.An hour later he halted.An inviting swale left the river and led off to the right at an acute angle.He left his sled and limped up the swale for half a mile.Between him and the river was three hundred yards of flat ground covered with cottonwoods.He crossed the cottonwoods to the bank of the Yukon.The trail went by just beneath, but he did not descend to it.South toward Selkirk he could see the trail widen its sunken length through the snow for over a mile.But to the north, in the direction of Minto, a tree-covered out-jut in the bank a quarter of a mile away screened the trail from him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他对这番景象似乎很满意，接着又按原路回到雪橇那儿。他把绳套背到肩上，拉着雪橇往洼地那里走去。雪并不瓷实，踏上去很软，所以走到那儿不是件容易的事。雪橇的滑板常常被雪塞住不能动弹，还没走半英里他就喘起了粗气。他支好自己的小帐篷，搭起铁皮炉，又劈完了一堆柴火，干完这些后，夜幕已经快要降临了。他没有蜡烛，就怡然自得地喝了壶茶，然后钻进了毯子里。</td>
		<td class="en">He seemed satisfied with the view and returned to the sled the way he had come.He put the haul-rope over his shoulder and dragged the sled up the swale.The snow was unpacked and soft, and it was hard work.The runners clogged and stuck, and he was panting severely ere he had covered the half-mile.Night had come on by the time he had pitched his small tent, set up the sheet-iron stove, and chopped a supply of firewood.He had no candles, and contented himself with a pot of tea before crawling into his blankets.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一大早，他刚起床就戴上手套，拉下帽檐盖住耳朵，穿过棉白杨林来到了育空河上。他随身带上了步枪。和以前一样，他没有走下河岸。他盯着空荡荡的小路看了有一个钟头，一边不停地搓手跺脚好促进血液循环，之后又回到帐篷去吃早饭。罐里没多少茶叶了——顶多够泡六回的；可他只往茶壶里放了那么一小撮，希望剩下的这些茶叶还够泡无限回。他所有的粮食储备就剩下半袋面粉和大半罐发酵粉了。他做了些点心，慢慢地吃着，每一口都嚼得那么有滋味。吃了三块后他停了下来。他盘算了一会儿，伸手去拿另一块，可又犹豫了。他走到面粉袋那儿，把它提起来掂量了一下有多重。</td>
		<td class="en">In the morning, as soon as he got up, he drew on his mittens, pulled the flaps of his cap down over his ears, and crossed through the cottonwoods to the Yukon.He took his rifle with him.As before, he did not descend the bank.He watched the empty trail for an hour, beating his hands and stamping his feet to keep up the circulation, then returned to the tent for breakfast.There was little tea left in the canister—half a dozen drawings at most; but so meagre a pinch did he put in the teapot that he bade fair to extend the lifetime of the tea indefinitely.His entire food supply consisted of half-a-sack of flour and a part-full can of baking powder.He made biscuits, and ate them slowly, chewing each mouthful with infinite relish.When he had had three he called a halt.He debated a while, reached for another biscuit, then hesitated.He turned to the part sack of flour, lifted it, and judged its weight.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我还能挺两个星期。”他大声说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m good for a couple of weeks,” he spoke aloud.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“或许三个星期。”他接着说道，一边把点心放好。</td>
		<td class="en">“Maybe three,” he added, as he put the biscuits away.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他又戴上手套，把帽檐拉下来，拿起步枪向他在河岸那儿的蹲伏点走去。他蹲在雪地里隐藏好自己，观察着周围。他一动不动地蹲了几分钟，可霜冻却开始侵袭，于是他把枪横在膝上，反复地搓着手。接着脚上的疼痛让他受不住了，于是他离开河岸往回走，深一脚浅一脚地在林间艰难跋涉。可他步行不了多远就会停下来。每隔几分钟他都要走到岸边，来回地盯着小路看，好像单凭意志就能想出个人来走在小路上似的。早上过去了，虽然很短，可他却觉得像是过了一个世纪那么久，而路上还是空无一人。</td>
		<td class="en">Again he drew on his mittens, pulled down his ear-flaps, took the rifle, and went out to his station on the river bank.He crouched in the snow, himself unseen, and watched.After a few minutes of inaction, the frost began to bite in, and he rested the rifle across his knees and beat his hands back and forth.Then the sting in his feet became intolerable, and he stepped back from the bank and tramped heavily up and down among the trees.But he did not tramp long at a time.Every several minutes he came to the edge of the bank and peered up and down the trail, as though by sheer will he could materialise the form of a man upon it.The short morning passed, though it had seemed century-long to him, and the trail remained empty.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >下午的时候，在河岸上观察要容易些了。气温有所上升，很快天空中飘下了雪——干燥、细小、水晶般晶莹。没有风，雪就那样一直飘落下来，安静而单调。他蜷起身子，眼睛一直闭着，头撑在膝盖上，用耳朵留意着小路上的动静。可没有狗的哀叫、雪橇的吱吱扭扭，也没有赶车夫的叫喊来打破这种沉寂。黄昏时分他回到帐篷，劈了些柴火，又吃了两块点心，之后就钻进了毯子里。他睡得很不踏实，一直翻来覆去地呻吟着，半夜里又起来吃了一块点心。</td>
		<td class="en">It was easier in the afternoon, watching by the bank.The temperature rose, and soon the snow began to fall—dry and fine and crystalline.There was no wind, and it fell straight down, in quiet monotony.He crouched with eyes closed, his head upon his knees, keeping his watch upon the trail with his ears.But no whining of dogs, churning of sleds, nor cries of drivers broke the silence.With twilight he returned to the tent, cut a supply of firewood, ate two biscuits, and crawled into his blankets.He slept restlessly, tossing about and groaning; and at midnight he got up and ate another biscuit.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >天越来越冷。四块点心不足以维持他体内的热量，即便喝了那么多云杉茶也不管用，于是他加了口粮，早晨晚上各吃三块。中午他什么也不吃，只是喝了几杯极其淡而无味的茶。这成了惯例。早上三块点心，中午喝茶，晚上三块点心。期间他会喝云杉茶治疗坏血病。他发现点心做得比以前大了些，经过一番激烈的挣扎，又回到原来的大小。</td>
		<td class="en">Each day grew colder.Four biscuits could not keep up the heat of his body, despite the quantities of hot spruce tea he drank, and he increased his allowance, morning and evening, to three biscuits.In the middle of the day he ate nothing, contenting himself with several cups of excessively weak real tea.This programme became routine.In the morning three biscuits, at noon real tea, and at night three biscuits.In between he drank spruce tea for his scurvy.He caught himself making larger biscuits, and after a severe struggle with himself went back to the old size.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >到了第五天，小路上恢复了些生气。南面出现了一个黑色的东西，并且越来越大。摩根森警觉起来。他拿起步枪，从枪膛退出装弹的弹盒，以同样的动作换上另外一盒子弹，之后又把退出来的弹盒放回存放弹药的地方。他扣动扳机到半待发的位置，戴上手套暖和着搂扳机的手。黑色的东西走近时，他看出来那是个人，没带狗也没有雪橇，轻装上阵。他紧张起来，扣动扳机准备发射，可又扳回了半待发的位置。那是个印第安人，摩根森失望地叹了口气，又将步枪横在膝上。印第安人沿着去往明托的方向一直走过去，最后消失在那片突出来的树丛后。</td>
		<td class="en">On the fifth day the trail returned to life.To the south a dark object appeared, and grew larger.Morganson became alert.He worked his rifle, ejecting a loaded cartridge from the chamber, by the same action replacing it with another, and returning the ejected cartridge into the magazine.He lowered the trigger to half-cock, and drew on his mitten to keep the trigger-hand warm.As the dark object came nearer he made it out to be a man, without dogs or sled, travelling light.He grew nervous, cocked the trigger, then put it back to half-cock again.The man developed into an Indian, and Morganson, with a sigh of disappointment, dropped the rifle across his knees.The Indian went on past and disappeared towards Minto behind the out-jutting clump of trees.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可摩根森想到了一个主意。他换了个蹲伏的地点，两旁棉白杨的树枝纵横。在这些棉白杨中，他用斧子砍了两个大凹口。接着，他把枪筒架在其中一个凹口上，扫视着眼前的景象。从那儿他可以全方位地俯瞰小路。转过身来他又把步枪架到另一个凹口上，沿着小路放眼望去，一直望到那片树丛，树丛后的路就看不见了。</td>
		<td class="en">But Morganson conceived an idea.He changed his crouching spot to a place where cottonwood limbs projected on either side of him.Into these with his axe he chopped two broad notches.Then in one of the notches he rested the barrel of his rifle and glanced along the sights.He covered the trail thoroughly in that direction.He turned about, rested the rifle in the other notch, and, looking along the sights, swept the trail to the clump of trees behind which it disappeared.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他从没走下河岸到小路上去过。小路上的行人不会知道他正埋伏在上面的河岸上。雪面完好无损。小路上也没留下他的雪橇经过的痕迹。</td>
		<td class="en">He never descended to the trail.A man travelling the trail could have no knowledge of his lurking presence on the bank above.The snow surface was unbroken.There was no place where his tracks left the main trail.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >夜越来越长，他白天观察小路的时间也越来越短。一次有一只雪橇经过，铃铛在夜色中响着，他忿恨地一边嚼着点心，一边听着铃响。机会总是和他作对。他诚心地观察了小路十天，忍受着寒冷和这该死的漫长的折磨，可就是没什么事发生。只有一个两手空空的印第安人路过。而现在，在黑夜里伸手不见五指的时候，会有人、狗，还有载着生的希望的雪橇经过，一路向南，向着大海、阳光，还有文明奔去。</td>
		<td class="en">As the nights grew longer, his periods of daylight watching of the trail grew shorter.Once a sled went by with jingling bells in the darkness, and with sullen resentment he chewed his biscuits and listened to the sounds.Chance conspired against him.Faithfully he had watched the trail for ten days, suffering from the cold all the prolonged torment of the damned, and nothing had happened.Only an Indian, travelling light, had passed in.Now, in the night, when it was impossible for him to watch, men and dogs and a sled loaded with life, passed out, bound south to the sea and the sun and civilisation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他设想的雪橇就是那样的；他也一直在等待着。那上面载着的就是生命，是他的生命。在冰天雪地的帐篷里，他的生命在慢慢消逝，他越来越衰弱，奄奄一息。没有食物，他很虚弱，走都走不动了。但在他等待的雪橇上却有可以拉他走的狗，有可以点燃他生之希望的食物，还有可以帮他走向大海、阳光和文明的金钱。大海、阳光和文明成了生命的代名词，他的生命；它们就装载在他等待的那只雪橇上。他陶醉在这想法中不能自拔，越来越觉得自己就是那载着生的希望而来的雪橇的合法主人，只是雪橇被人夺去了而已。</td>
		<td class="en">So it was that he conceived of the sled for which he waited.It was loaded with life, his life.His life was fading, fainting, gasping away in the tent in the snow.He was weak from lack of food, and could not travel of himself.But on the sled for which he waited were dogs that would drag him, food that would fan up the flame of his life, money that would furnish sea and sun and civilisation.Sea and sun and civilisation became terms interchangeable with life, his life, and they were loaded there on the sled for which he waited.The idea became an obsession, and he grew to think of himself as the rightful and deprived owner of the sled-load of life.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >面粉快要用完了，他又像过去一样早晚只吃两块点心。因为这个，他的身体越来越弱，天也越来越冷。死寂的小路就是不肯为他恢复生机，不过他还是一天天地盯着。终于，坏血病恶化到了下一个阶段。皮肤不能排出血液中的杂质，于是身体开始浮肿。他的脚踝也肿胀起来，疼得他夜里久久不能睡去。接着浮肿蔓延到了膝盖，疼痛可不只是翻倍而已。</td>
		<td class="en">His flour was running short, and he went back to two biscuits in the morning and two biscuits at night.Because of this, his weakness increased and the cold bit in more savagely, and day by day he watched by the dead trail that would not live for him.At last the scurvy entered upon its next stage.The skin was unable longer to cast off the impurity of the blood, and the result was that the body began to swell.His ankles grew puffy, and the ache in them kept him awake long hours at night.Next, the swelling jumped to his knees, and the sum of his pain was more than doubled.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >之后，一场寒流突袭。气温一降再降——零下四十度，零下五十度，零下六十度。他没有温度计，可通过一些征兆和自然现象也能知道，那个国家所有的人都懂这些——水泼到雪地上劈啪作响，霜冻来得又快又刺骨，一口气刚呼出来就在帐篷里帆布的四壁和篷顶上结了冰。他和寒冷抗争着，坚持在河岸上观察，可还是一无所获。虚弱的体质使他就像只可以轻易猎取的猎物，还没等他跑回帐篷蜷缩在炉火旁，霜冻就侵袭了他的身体。他的鼻子和脸颊都冻青了，虽然戴着手套，可左手的大拇指还是冻伤了。他觉得就算自己幸存下来，大拇指也残废了。</td>
		<td class="en">Then there came a cold snap.The temperature went down and down—forty, fifty, sixty degrees below zero.He had no thermometer, but this he knew by the signs and natural phenomena understood by all men in that country—the crackling of water thrown on the snow, the swift sharpness of the bite of the frost, and the rapidity with which his breath froze and coated the canvas walls and roof of the tent.Vainly he fought the cold and strove to maintain his watch on the bank.In his weak condition he was an easy prey, and the frost sank its teeth deep into him before he fled away to the tent and crouched by the fire.His nose and cheeks were frozen and turned black, and his left thumb had frozen inside the mitten.He concluded that he would escape with the loss of the first joint.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >刚被霜冻逼进帐篷，小路上却突然充满了生机，这真是讽刺极了。第一天有三驾雪橇经过，第二天有两驾。有一段时间，他每天都会奋力爬到岸边两次，可总会挫败地退回来，而且每次回来后不到半个小时就会有一驾雪橇经过。</td>
		<td class="en">Then it was, beaten into the tent by the frost, that the trail, with monstrous irony, suddenly teemed with life.Three sleds went by the first day, and two the second.Once, during each day, he fought his way out to the bank only to succumb and retreat, and each of the two times, within half-an-hour after he retreated, a sled went by.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >寒流过去后，他又能待在河岸上了，可小路又沉寂了下来。一个星期里他就蜷在那儿观察，可小路上没有一丝生气，没有一个人影。他把饭量减到了早晚各一块点心，而不知怎的，自己好像都没有注意到似的。有时候他都会惊奇自己怎么还活着。他可没想到能坚持这么久。</td>
		<td class="en">The cold snap broke, and he was able to remain by the bank once more, and the trail died again.For a week he crouched and watched, and never life stirred along it, not a soul passed in or out.He had cut down to one biscuit night and morning, and somehow he did not seem to notice it.Sometimes he marvelled at the way life remained in him.He never would have thought it possible to endure so much.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >小路上又有了人群的骚动，可这些人却是他对付不了的。西北警局的一个分队路过，有二十几个人，带着不少雪橇和狗；河岸上的他蜷下身子，警察们都没察觉到死亡的威胁，而这威胁就来自潜伏在小路边的那个奄奄一息的人。</td>
		<td class="en">When the trail fluttered anew with life it was life with which he could not cope.A detachment of the North-West police went by, a score of them, with many sleds and dogs; and he cowered down on the bank above, and they were unaware of the menace of death that lurked in the form of a dying man beside the trail.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >冻伤的拇指给他添了不少麻烦。在河岸上观察时，他渐渐养成了摘下手套、把手插进汗衫里的习惯，为的是把大拇指放在胳肢窝里取暖。一个邮递员经过小路，摩根森放他过去了。邮递员是重要人物，所以是肯定会被很快放行的。</td>
		<td class="en">His frozen thumb gave him a great deal of trouble.While watching by the bank he got into the habit of taking his mitten off and thrusting the hand inside his shirt so as to rest the thumb in the warmth of his arm-pit.A mail carrier came over the trail, and Morganson let him pass.A mail carrier was an important person, and was sure to be missed immediately.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >摩根森把待发射的步枪架在树的凹口上。他突然觉得手指冰凉，才发现右手原来是光着的。他都不知道自己把那只手套摘掉了。他又匆忙把它戴上。人和狗走近了，他们的呼吸在寒冷的空气中都能看得见。第一个人走到离他五十码远的时候，摩根森把右手从手套里抽了出来。他把食指放在扳机上，瞄准下方。他开了一枪，第一个人身子回旋了半圈就摔倒在了小路上。</td>
		<td class="en">Morganson rested his cocked rifle in the notch in the tree.He became abruptly aware that his fingers were cold, and discovered that his right hand was bare.He did not know that he had taken off the mitten.He slipped it on again hastily.The men and dogs drew closer, and he could see their breaths spouting into visibility in the cold air.When the first man was fifty yards away, Morganson slipped the mitten from his right hand.He placed the first finger on the trigger and aimed low.When he fired the first man whirled half around and went down on the trail.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们还在惊诧的那一瞬间，摩根森又扣动扳机射向约翰·汤普森——打得太低了，因为汤普森没站稳，一下坐到了雪橇上。摩根森把枪筒抬高一点，又开了一枪。约翰·汤普森从载满物品的雪橇的前面向后跌落在地上。</td>
		<td class="en">In the instant of surprise, Morganson pulled the trigger on John Thompson—too low, for the latter staggered and sat down suddenly on the sled.Morganson raised his aim and fired again.John Thompson sank down backward along the top of the loaded sled.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >摩根森转向了奥利森。他看到后者正朝着明托的方向逃，与此同时，他也注意到那群狗跑到堵着小路的第一个人的身旁停了下来。摩根森朝逃跑的人开了一枪，但没打中，奥利森突然转向一边。他左右闪躲，摩根森快射两枪，不过都没打中。摩根森又要扣动扳机，却停了下来。他已经开了六抢。只剩一颗子弹了，就在枪膛里。最后一枪他绝对不能打偏。</td>
		<td class="en">Morganson turned his attention to Oleson.At the same time that he noted the latter running away towards Minto he noted that the dogs, coming to where the first man’s body blocked the trail, had halted.Morganson fired at the fleeing man and missed, and Oleson swerved.He continued to swerve back and forth, while Morganson fired twice in rapid succession and missed both shots.Morganson stopped himself just as he was pulling the trigger again.He had fired six shots.Only one more cartridge remained, and it was in the chamber.It was imperative that he should not miss his last shot.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他一直没开枪，死命地观察着奥利森的逃跑路线。这个大个子沿着小路跑得飞快，左躲右闪的，那样子真是怪异。他大衣的下摆还在身后轻快地拍打着。摩根森把步枪对准这个人，随着他飘忽不定的逃跑路线，摩根森的枪也左右摇摆着。摩根森的手指快要冻麻了。他都感觉不到扳机了。“上帝帮帮我。”他大声祈祷着，然后扣动了扳机。跑着的人一头栽倒在地上，又从硬硬的路面上弹起来，身子滑出去，滚了一圈又一圈。他胳膊扑腾着挣扎了一会儿，然后就躺在那儿不动了。</td>
		<td class="en">He held his fire and desperately studied Oleson’s flight.The giant was grotesquely curving and twisting and running at top speed along the trail, the tail of his parka flapping smartly behind.Morganson trained his rifle on the man and with a swaying action followed his erratic flight.Morganson’s finger was getting numb.He could scarcely feel the trigger.“God help me,” he breathed a prayer aloud, and pulled the trigger.The running man pitched forward on his face, rebounded from the hard trail, and slid along, rolling over and over.He threshed for a moment with his arms and then lay quiet.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >摩根森扔下步枪（用完最后一颗子弹后，枪也没什么用了），顺着柔软的雪地上滑下河岸。既然他已经跳出了埋伏，继续隐藏在埋伏的地方也就不再有必要了。他沿着小路蹒跚地走到雪橇那儿，手套里的手不由得攥紧了。</td>
		<td class="en">Morganson dropped his rifle (worthless now that the last cartridge was gone) and slid down the bank through the soft snow.Now that he had sprung the trap, concealment of his lurking-place was no longer necessary.He hobbled along the trail to the sled, his fingers making involuntary gripping and clutching movements inside the mittens.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >狗的咆哮声让他停了下来。领头的狗很强壮，有一半纽芬兰血统，一半哈得孙贝血统。它就立在躺在小路上的那个人身旁，毛发竖立，呲着牙恫吓着摩根森。剩下的七条狗同样也竖着毛嚎叫着。摩根森试着靠近，狗群却要朝他奔过来。他又停下来和这些动物说话，一会儿威胁，一会儿哄骗。他注意到头一只狗脚下的那个人，惊讶于他的脸色怎么会这么快就变白了；生命之潮退去，白霜悄然降临。雪橇前面的约翰·汤普森向后仰躺着，头扎在两个袋子中间，下巴向上倾着，所以摩根森只能看见他那朝天的黑色络腮胡。</td>
		<td class="en">The snarling of the dogs halted him.The leader, a heavy dog, half Newfoundland and half Hudson Bay, stood over the body of the man that lay on the trail, and menaced Morganson with bristling hair and bared fangs.The other seven dogs of the team were likewise bristling and snarling.Morganson approached tentatively, and the team surged towards him.He stopped again and talked to the animals, threatening and cajoling by turns.He noticed the face of the man under the leader’s feet, and was surprised at how quickly it had turned white with the ebb of life and the entrance of the frost.John Thompson lay back along the top of the loaded sled, his head sunk in a space between two sacks and his chin tilted upwards, so that all Morganson could see was the black beard pointing skyward.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >发现自己对付不了这群狗，摩根森就走下小路来到厚厚的雪地里，他踉跄着转了个大圈来到雪橇后边。在领头的狗的带领下，整个狗群都在缠在一起的挽具里来回窜动。因为自己的腿跛着，摩根森只能慢慢地挪动。看到这群狗朝他围过来，他想要往后退。他差点就成功了，可是领头的大狗凶猛地向前一扑，咬住了他的小腿肚。小腿上的肉被撕裂了，咬出了一个大口子，可摩根森还是设法全身而退了。</td>
		<td class="en">Finding it impossible to face the dogs Morganson stepped off the trail into the deep snow and floundered in a wide circle to the rear of the sled.Under the initiative of the leader, the team swung around in its tangled harness.Because of his crippled condition, Morganson could move only slowly.He saw the animals circling around on him and tried to retreat.He almost made it, but the big leader, with a savage lunge, sank its teeth into the calf of his leg.The flesh was slashed and torn, but Morganson managed to drag himself clear.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他厉声咒骂这些畜生，可就是不能吓退它们。它们竖起脖子上的毛咆哮着回应他，一边敏捷地向前扑着，不过胸前拴着的带子拉住了它们。他想起了奥利森，于是转过身来沿着小路往前走。他几乎都没注意自己受伤的腿。血肆无忌惮地流着，动脉被咬破了，可他都不知道。</td>
		<td class="en">He cursed the brutes fiercely, but could not cow them.They replied with neck-bristling and snarling, and with quick lunges against their breastbands.He remembered Oleson, and turned his back upon them and went along the trail.He scarcely took notice of his lacerated leg.It was bleeding freely; the main artery had been torn, but he did not know it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对摩根森来说，瑞典人极度苍白的脸色特别引人注目，前一天晚上他的脸色还那么红润。可现在他的脸就像白色大理石一样苍白。他的头发和睫毛金黄，看上去更像个雕塑，而不像几分钟前的那个人。摩根森摘下手套，开始搜索尸体。腰上没缠钱带，他也没发现装金子的袋子。在胸前的口袋里他无意发现了一个小钱包。天特别冷，手指头很快就被冻麻了，他匆忙掏出钱包里的东西。有几封贴着国外的邮票，盖着国外邮戳的信件，还有几张收据和备查账页，以及八百美元的信用证。这就是全部的东西。没有钱。</td>
		<td class="en">Especially remarkable to Morganson was the extreme pallor of the Swede, who the preceding night had been so ruddy-faced.Now his face was like white marble.What with his fair hair and lashes he looked like a carved statue rather than something that had been a man a few minutes before.Morganson pulled off his mittens and searched the body.There was no money-belt around the waist next to the skin, nor did he find a gold-sack.In a breast pocket he lit on a small wallet.With fingers that swiftly went numb with the frost, he hurried through the contents of the wallet.There were letters with foreign stamps and postmarks on them, and several receipts and memorandum accounts, and a letter of credit for eight hundred dollars.That was all.There was no money.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他活动了一下想回到雪橇那儿，却发现自己站在那儿动不了了。往下一瞥，他看到自己脚下是一堆刚刚冻起来的红色沉积物。他被撕扯开的裤腿上以及下面的鹿皮鞋上都结着红色的冰。他猛地一用力就破冰而出，沿着小路一瘸一拐地回到了雪橇那儿。咬了他的那条领头的大狗开始咆哮着要冲过来，接着整个狗群都跟着它做同样的动作。</td>
		<td class="en">He made a movement to start back toward the sled, but found his foot rooted to the trail.He glanced down and saw that he stood in a fresh deposit of frozen red.There was red ice on his torn pants leg and on the moccasin beneath.With a quick effort he broke the frozen clutch of his blood and hobbled along the trail to the sled.The big leader that had bitten him began snarling and lunging, and was followed in this conduct by the whole team.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >摩根森虚弱地哭着走了一段距离，他拖着虚弱的身子在路上左摇右摆。然后他拂去缀在睫毛上结了冰的眼泪。真是开玩笑。恶毒的命运在嘲笑他。甚至是胡子朝天的约翰·汤普森也在嘲笑他。</td>
		<td class="en">Morganson wept weakly for a space, and weakly swayed from one side to the other.Then he brushed away the frozen tears that gemmed his lashes.It was a joke.Malicious chance was having its laugh at him.Even John Thompson, with his heaven-aspiring whiskers, was laughing at him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他像个疯子似的在雪橇四周徘徊，时而为了雪橇上救命的东西哭哭啼啼地哀求这些牲畜，时而又无可奈何地冲它们发火。接着，他平静了下来。他一直都在出自己的洋相。他只需要回到帐篷，拿着斧子回来把这群狗的脑袋砍下来。他要让狗看看自己的厉害。</td>
		<td class="en">He prowled around the sled demented, at times weeping and pleading with the brutes for his life there on the sled, at other times raging impotently against them.Then calmness came upon him.He had been making a fool of himself.All he had to do was to go to the tent, get the axe, and return and brain the dogs.He’d show them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >要回到帐篷，他必须远远绕开雪橇和这群凶猛的狗。他走下小路，踏上软软的雪地。接着他突然感觉一阵晕眩，于是赶忙站住。他不敢再走了，怕会摔倒。好长时间他就站在那儿不动，靠着残疾的双腿保持平衡，而双腿因为没劲还剧烈地颤抖着。他看着脚下，雪被染红了。血还是肆无忌惮地流着。他没想到会咬得这么严重。他压制着晕眩的感觉，弯下身子去查看伤口。雪似乎朝他袭来，他像遭了一击似的向后退步。他惊慌失措，生怕自己会摔倒，挣扎了一番才又站直了。他很害怕刚才朝他袭来的雪。</td>
		<td class="en">In order to get to the tent he had to go wide of the sled and the savage animals.He stepped off the trail into the soft snow.Then he felt suddenly giddy and stood still.He was afraid to go on for fear he would fall down.He stood still for a long time, balancing himself on his crippled legs that were trembling violently from weakness.He looked down and saw the snow reddening at his feet.The blood flowed freely as ever.He had not thought the bite was so severe.He controlled his giddiness and stooped to examine the wound.The snow seemed rushing up to meet him, and he recoiled from it as from a blow.He had a panic fear that he might fall down, and after a struggle he managed to stand upright again.He was afraid of that snow that had rushed up to him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接着白光一黑，他醒来时只记得自己摔倒在了雪地上。他不再觉得晕眩。混乱已经过去。可他站不起来。他的四肢没了力气。他的身体好像没有了知觉。他费尽力气才把身子侧过来。侧着身子，他瞥见了雪橇和约翰·汤普森朝天的黑络腮胡。他还看见领头的那条狗在舔小路上躺着的那人的脸。摩根森好奇地看着。狗紧张而焦急。有时它发出几声短促的尖叫，像是要唤醒地上的人；它会竖起耳朵，摇晃着尾巴检查那人一番。最后它坐下来，鼻子朝天，开始嚎叫。紧接着这群狗都嚎叫起来。</td>
		<td class="en">Then the white glimmer turned black, and the next he knew he was awakening in the snow where he had fallen.He was no longer giddy.The cobwebs were gone.But he could not get up.There was no strength in his limbs.His body seemed lifeless.By a desperate effort he managed to roll over on his side.In this position he caught a glimpse of the sled and of John Thompson’s black beard pointing skyward.Also he saw the lead dog licking the face of the man who lay on the trail.Morganson watched curiously.The dog was nervous and eager.Sometimes it uttered short, sharp yelps, as though to arouse the man, and surveyed him with ears cocked forward and wagging tail.At last it sat down, pointed its nose upward, and began to howl.Soon all the team was howling.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >既然他已经倒下了，摩根森就不再害怕了。他想象着自己被人发现死在雪地里，自怜地哭了好一会儿。可是他并不害怕。他不再挣扎了。他试着睁开眼睛，却发现已经睁不开了，因为眼眶周围的眼泪结成了冰。他都没想要把冰拂去。无所谓了。他从没想过死亡会是这么简单。他更恼怒为什么自己要挣扎，要忍受这么多个让他疲惫不堪的星期。他曾被对死亡的恐惧威吓过、欺骗过。死亡不会带来痛苦。他所遭受的折磨都是生命带来的折磨。生命污蔑死亡。这真是残酷。</td>
		<td class="en">Now that he was down, Morganson was no longer afraid.He had a vision of himself being found dead in the snow, and for a while he wept in self-pity.But he was not afraid.The struggle had gone out of him.When he tried to open his eyes he found that the wet tears had frozen them shut.He did not try to brush the ice away.It did not matter.He had not dreamed death was so easy.He was even angry that he had struggled and suffered through so many weary weeks.He had been bullied and cheated by the fear of death.Death did not hurt.Every torment he had endured had been a torment of life.Life had defamed death.It was a cruel thing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是他的愤怒消去了。生命中的谎言和欺骗都无关紧要了，因为自己正在承受这后果。他感觉到了睡意，感觉到香甜的睡眠正悄然而至，仿佛会缓解他的疼痛，让他休息休息，他也就感到没那么疼了。他隐约听到了狗的嚎叫声，一时觉得控制住自己的躯体也就不感觉冷了。接着，点缀着泪珠的眼皮底下没了光亮和思绪，他疲惫地松了口气就睡着了。</td>
		<td class="en">But his anger passed.The lies and frauds of life were of no consequence now that he was coming to his own.He became aware of drowsiness, and felt a sweet sleep stealing upon him, balmy with promises of easement and rest.He heard faintly the howling of the dogs, and had a fleeting thought that in the mastering of his flesh the frost no longer bit.Then the light and the thought ceased to pulse beneath the tear-gemmed eyelids, and with a tired sigh of comfort he sank into sleep.</td></tr>
