		<td class="en">CHAPTER I—THE TUTOR, KARL IVANITCH</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一八ＸＸ年八月十二日——（就是在我得到了精美礼物的十岁生日后的第三天），早上七点，我被卡尔·伊万内奇吵醒了，他拿着用棍子和糖纸做成的苍蝇拍在我脑袋边的墙上拍打。他动作很粗暴，还打到了我挂在橡木床架上的守护神像，死苍蝇都落到了我的卷发上。我从被子里往外窥视，用手扶稳了摇晃着的神像，把死苍蝇弹到地板上，然后用困倦的眼睛怒气冲冲地盯着卡尔·伊万内奇。他，身穿花布棉袍，腰上系着根同样材料的宽腰带，头上戴着一顶带帽缨的红色针织帽，脚上穿着柔软的羊皮拖鞋，还在绕着墙边走来走去，瞄准苍蝇，然后拍下去。</td>
		<td class="en">On the 12th of August, 18—(just three days after my tenth birthday, when I had been given such wonderful presents), I was awakened at seven o’clock in the morning by Karl Ivanitch slapping the wall close to my head with a fly-flap made of sugar paper and a stick.He did this so roughly that he hit the image of my patron saint suspended to the oaken back of my bed, and the dead fly fell down on my curls.I peeped out from under the coverlet, steadied the still shaking image with my hand, flicked the dead fly on to the floor, and gazed at Karl Ivanitch with sleepy, wrathful eyes.He, in a parti-coloured wadded dressing-gown fastened about the waist with a wide belt of the same material, a red knitted cap adorned with a tassel, and soft slippers of goat skin, went on walking round the walls and taking aim at, and slapping, flies.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“就算，”我暗暗想，“我只是个小孩，但他为什么偏偏来打扰我呢？他怎么不去沃洛达的床边打苍蝇？不会的，沃洛达比我大，我是家中最小的，所以他才来折磨我。这就是他整天想的东西——怎么欺负我。他很清楚自己把我吵醒了，吓到了我，但还是假装不知道。讨厌的混蛋！他的长袍、帽子、帽缨统统都很讨厌！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Suppose,” I thought to myself, “that I am only a small boy, yet why should he disturb me?Why does he not go killing flies around Woloda’s bed?No; Woloda is older than I, and I am the youngest of the family, so he torments me.That is what he thinks of all day long—how to tease me.He knows very well that he has woken me up and frightened me, but he pretends not to notice it.Disgusting brute!And his dressing-gown and cap and tassel too—they are all of them disgusting.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我正暗自发泄着对卡尔·伊万内奇的怒气，他已经走到了自己床边，看了下他挂在镶了小玻璃珠的座子里的表。他把苍蝇拍挂回一颗钉子上，然后转向我们，很显然心情不错，大概是前所未有地好。</td>
		<td class="en">While I was thus inwardly venting my wrath upon Karl Ivanitch, he had passed to his own bedstead, looked at his watch (which hung suspended in a little shoe sewn with bugles), and deposited the fly-flap on a nail, then, evidently in the most cheerful mood possible, he turned round to us.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“起床了，孩子们！是时候了，你们的母亲已经在客厅里了。”他用很重的德国口音喊道。然后他向我走来，在我的脚边坐下，从口袋里掏出他的鼻烟壶。我假装睡着的样子。卡尔·伊万内奇打了个喷嚏，擦了擦鼻子，弹了弹手指，然后就开始捉弄我、挠我的脚趾取乐，一边挠还一边笑着说：“起来啦，起来啦，小懒虫！”</td>
		<td class="en">“Get up, children!It is quite time, and your mother is already in the drawing-room,” he exclaimed in his strong German accent.Then he crossed over to me, sat down at my feet, and took his snuff-box out of his pocket.I pretended to be asleep.Karl Ivanitch sneezed, wiped his nose, flicked his fingers, and began amusing himself by teasing me and tickling my toes as he said with a smile, “Well, well, little lazy one!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管我很怕痒，我还是决定不起床也不理他。只是把脑袋深深地埋进枕头里，拼命乱踢，并且绷紧了神经不笑出来。</td>
		<td class="en">For all my dread of being tickled, I determined not to get out of bed or to answer him, but hid my head deeper in the pillow, kicked out with all my strength, and strained every nerve to keep from laughing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他真好，而且真喜欢我们！”我想，“但我刚刚还那么讨厌他！”</td>
		<td class="en">“How kind he is, and how fond of us!” I thought to myself.“Yet to think that I could be hating him so just now!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我生气，既生自己的气，也生卡尔·伊万内奇的气；我又想哭又想笑，神经已经绷到极限。</td>
		<td class="en">I felt angry, both with myself and with Karl Ivanitch, I wanted to laugh and to cry at the same time, for my nerves were all on edge.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“别管我了，卡尔！”我终于忍不住叫出来，从床单下探出头，眼泪汪汪的。</td>
		<td class="en">“Leave me alone, Karl!”I exclaimed at length, with tears in my eyes, as I raised my head from beneath the bed-clothes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >卡尔·伊万内吃了一惊。他也不挠我脚底了；他亲切地问我怎么了。是不是我做噩梦了？他善良的德国面容和他脸上试图得知我为何流泪的关切神情，反而使我的眼泪流得更快了。我感到良心不安，无法理解为什么一分钟前我会讨厌卡尔，并连同讨厌他的长袍、帽子和帽缨。现在它们看起来却可爱极了。帽缨甚至成了他善良的证明。我回答说我哭是因为我做了个噩梦，我梦到母亲死了，正在下葬。当然这只是我编出来的，我根本不记得那天晚上都梦到了些什么。但事实是，卡尔试图抚慰我、让我安心时的神情渐渐让我开始相信我是真的做了这样一个噩梦。于是我的眼泪流得更凶了——但这另有原因，跟他想象的不同。</td>
		<td class="en">Karl Ivanitch was taken aback. He left off tickling my feet, and asked me kindly what the matter was.Had I had a disagreeable dream?His good German face and the sympathy with which he sought to know the cause of my tears made them flow the faster.I felt conscience-stricken, and could not understand how, only a minute ago, I had been hating Karl, and thinking his dressing-gown and cap and tassel disgusting.On the contrary, they looked eminently lovable now.Even the tassel seemed another token of his goodness.I replied that I was crying because I had had a bad dream, and had seen Mamma dead and being buried.Of course it was a mere invention, since I did not remember having dreamt anything at all that night, but the truth was that Karl’s sympathy as he tried to comfort and reassure me had gradually made me believe that I had dreamt such a horrible dream, and so weep the more—though from a different cause to the one he imagined.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >卡尔·伊万内奇离开我后，我从床上坐起来，开始往我的小脚上套袜子。我的眼泪已经干得差不多了，但是因为那个编出来的梦所产生的悲伤还未散去。这时，照顾孩子们的尼科拉叔叔（在俄罗斯这个称呼是孩子们用来称呼老仆的）进来了——他是一个整洁、矮小的男人，总是严肃、谦恭而有条理，也是卡尔的好朋友。他带来了我们的衣服和靴子——至少，有给沃洛达的靴子和给我的那双破旧的、让人讨厌的、打着花结的鞋子。在他面前我不好意思哭了，而且，早晨的阳光已经欢快地透过了窗子，沃洛达正站在洗漱架前模仿着玛利亚·伊万诺芙娜（姐姐的家庭教师），笑得又大声又持久，连严肃的尼科拉——肩上挂着毛巾，一手拿着肥皂，一手拿着盆——也忍不住笑起来说道：“能让我给你洗了吗，费拉基米尔·彼得洛维奇？”这下我彻底开心起来。</td>
		<td class="en">When Karl Ivanitch had left me, I sat up in bed and proceeded to draw my stockings over my little feet.The tears had quite dried now, yet the mournful thought of the invented dream was still haunting me a little.Presently Uncle (This term is often applied by children to old servants in Russia) Nicola came in—a neat little man who was always grave, methodical, and respectful, as well as a great friend of Karl’s. He brought with him our clothes and boots—at least, boots for Woloda, and for myself the old detestable, be-ribanded shoes.In his presence I felt ashamed to cry, and, moreover, the morning sun was shining so gaily through the window, and Woloda, standing at the washstand as he mimicked Maria Ivanovna (my sister’s governess), was laughing so loud and so long, that even the serious Nicola—a towel over his shoulder, the soap in one hand, and the basin in the other—could not help smiling as he said, “Will you please let me wash you, Vladimir Petrovitch?”I had cheered up completely.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你们准备好了吗？”卡尔的声音从教室传来。那声音的语气现在听起来十分严厉，完全没了他刚刚让我深深感动的亲切。事实上，一到教室里卡尔就完全变成了另外一个人，和其他的时候不一样。在那里他是家庭教师。我匆匆洗漱好，穿好衣服，手里还拿着刷子，一边梳理我湿湿的头发，一边回应他。卡尔戴着眼镜，手里拿着一本书，像往常一样，坐在门和一扇窗户之间。门的左边有两个小书架——一个是孩子们的（也就是我们的），另一个是卡尔自己的。我们的架子上堆了各种各样的书——有课本也有课外书——有的立着，有的平放着。只有两大本装订成红色的游记规规矩矩地靠墙放着。书架上还有很多书，厚的，薄的，大的，小的，有皮无书的，有书没皮的，因为每当课间休息卡尔让我们整理“图书馆”（卡尔这样称呼那些书架）时，我们就会把东西都胡乱塞到那里。而卡尔自己的书架上的书，虽然没有我们书架上这么多，种类却是更丰富。我还记得其中三本：一本没了封皮的德文小册子，讲的是在菜园里给白菜地施肥；一本是七年战争史（用羊皮纸装订着，烧掉了一角）；还有一本流体静力学教程。虽然卡尔花了大量的时间在阅读上，并因此损伤了视力，但他从不看除了这些书和《北方蜜蜂》之外的书。</td>
		<td class="en">“Are you nearly ready?” came Karl’s voice from the schoolroom.The tone of that voice sounded stern now, and had nothing in it of the kindness which had just touched me so much.In fact, in the schoolroom Karl was altogether a different man from what he was at other times.There he was the tutor.I washed and dressed myself hurriedly, and, a brush still in my hand as I smoothed my wet hair, answered to his call.Karl, with spectacles on nose and a book in his hand, was sitting, as usual, between the door and one of the windows.To the left of the door were two shelves—one of them the children’s (that is to say, ours), and the other one Karl’s own.Upon ours were heaped all sorts of books—lesson books and play books—some standing up and some lying down.The only two standing decorously against the wall were two large volumes of a Histoire des Voyages, in red binding.On that shelf could be seen books thick and thin and books large and small, as well as covers without books and books without covers, since everything got crammed up together anyhow when play time arrived and we were told to put the “library” (as Karl called these shelves) in order.The collection of books on his own shelf was, if not so numerous as ours, at least more varied.Three of them in particular I remember, namely, a German pamphlet (minus a cover) on Manuring Cabbages in Kitchen-Gardens, a History of the Seven Years’ War (bound in parchment and burnt at one corner), and a Course of Hydrostatics.Though Karl passed so much of his time in reading that he had injured his sight by doing so, he never read anything beyond these books and @The Northern Bee@.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >卡尔的书架上还有一件物品让我印象深刻。那是一个卡片做的圆盘，用一个螺丝固定在木架子上。圆盘上贴着一张图画，画着一位女士和一个理发师。对于做这个圆盘卡尔很在行，他发明这个就是为了保护他脆弱的眼睛不再受到强光的伤害。</td>
		<td class="en">Another article on Karl’s shelf I remember well.This was a round piece of cardboard fastened by a screw to a wooden stand, with a sort of comic picture of a lady and a hairdresser glued to the cardboard.Karl was very clever at fixing pieces of cardboard together, and had devised this contrivance for shielding his weak eyes from any very strong light.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >直到现在，我的眼前还能浮现出他的样子来——那个高高的身影穿着棉布长袍，戴着小红帽，帽子下还露出些许白发。他就坐在桌子边，圆盘上的理发师的阴影投射到他脸上。他一手捧着一本书，另一只手放在椅子的扶手上。他的面前放着表，表盘上画着一个猎人，还有一块方格棉手帕，一个圆形的黑鼻烟壶，一个绿色的眼镜盒。这些物品摆放得整洁而有序，清楚地反映出卡尔·伊万内奇有着纯净的心灵和安静的灵魂。</td>
		<td class="en">I can see him before me now—the tall figure in its wadded dressing-gown and red cap (a few grey hairs visible beneath the latter) sitting beside the table; the screen with the hairdresser shading his face; one hand holding a book, and the other one resting on the arm of the chair.Before him lie his watch, with a huntsman painted on the dial, a check cotton handkerchief, a round black snuff-box, and a green spectacle-case, The neatness and orderliness of all these articles show clearly that Karl Ivanitch has a clear conscience and a quiet mind.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有时候，当我在楼下大厅跑够了的时候，我就会踮着脚尖偷偷溜进教室，发现卡尔独自坐在他的扶手椅上，神情庄重而安详地研读着一本他最喜欢的书。也有些时候，他不在看书，眼镜低低地滑到他的鹰钩鼻上，他的蓝眼睛微合，唇边带着淡淡的微笑，带着一种奇特的表情，似乎正在凝视着什么。房间里很安静——没有任何声音，除了他均匀的呼吸声和那块盘上画着猎人的表的滴答声。他看不到我，而我会站在门边想着：“可怜啊，可怜的老人！我们有很多人，可以一起开心地玩耍，而他只能这样孤独地坐着，没人喜欢他。他说自己是孤儿，那一定是真的。他的一生实在是太悲惨了！我记得他跟尼科拉讲过他的身世，他的处境实在是太可怕了！”然后，我会为他感到难过，于是我便走过去，拉起他的手说道：“亲爱的卡尔·伊万内奇！”而当我这样说的时候，他明显愉悦起来，看起来有精神多了。</td>
		<td class="en">Sometimes, when tired of running about the salon downstairs, I would steal on tiptoe to the schoolroom and find Karl sitting alone in his armchair as, with a grave and quiet expression on his face, he perused one of his favourite books.Yet sometimes, also, there were moments when he was not reading, and when the spectacles had slipped down his large aquiline nose, and the blue, half-closed eyes and faintly smiling lips seemed to be gazing before them with a curious expression.All would be quiet in the room—not a sound being audible save his regular breathing and the ticking of the watch with the hunter painted on the dial.He would not see me, and I would stand at the door and think: “Poor, poor old man!There are many of us, and we can play together and be happy, but he sits there all alone, and has nobody to be fond of him.Surely he speaks truth when he says that he is an orphan.And the story of his life, too—how terrible it is!I remember him telling it to Nicola, How dreadful to be in his position!”Then I would feel so sorry for him that I would go to him, and take his hand, and say, “Dear Karl Ivanitch!” and he would be visibly delighted whenever I spoke to him like this, and would look much brighter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在教室的第二面墙上挂着一些地图——大多数都破损了，但卡尔的巧手还是将它们粘好了。第三面墙上（其中间是门），在门的一面挂着几把尺（一把是我们的——，上面都是划痕，另一把是他的——相当新）；门的另一边挂着一块黑板，上面记录着我们所犯的错误，严重的用圆圈，轻一点的用十字。黑板左边，是我们淘气时罚跪的角落。我清楚地记得那个角落——我记得那个炉门、炉门上的通风扇、以及当它们旋转时发出的噪声！有时，我得在那个角落里跪到后背和双膝都酸痛，于是我就会想：“卡尔·伊万内奇忘了我吗？他舒舒服服地坐在扶手椅上看流体静力学，可是我——”接着，为了让他想起我，我便会轻轻地拨弄通风扇。或者刮刮墙上的石灰；但是如果一块大石灰恰好掉到地上，会比任何惩罚都叫人害怕。我会回头望一望卡尔，但他还是安静地坐着，捧着书，好像他什么都没觉察到。</td>
		<td class="en">On the second wall of the schoolroom hung some maps—mostly torn, but glued together again by Karl’s hand.On the third wall (in the middle of which stood the door) hung, on one side of the door, a couple of rulers (one of them ours—much bescratched, and the other one his—quite a new one), with, on the further side of the door, a blackboard on which our more serious faults were marked by circles and our lesser faults by crosses.To the left of the blackboard was the corner in which we had to kneel when naughty.How well I remember that corner—the shutter on the stove, the ventilator above it, and the noise which it made when turned!Sometimes I would be made to stay in that corner till my back and knees were aching all over, and I would think to myself.“Has Karl Ivanitch forgotten me?He goes on sitting quietly in his armchair and reading his Hydrostatics, while I—!”Then, to remind him of my presence, I would begin gently turning the ventilator round.Or scratching some plaster off the wall; but if by chance an extra large piece fell upon the floor, the fright of it was worse than any punishment.I would glance round at Karl, but he would still be sitting there quietly, book in hand, and pretending that he had noticed nothing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >教室的中间有张桌子，用一块黑色的破油布罩着，油布被铅笔刀划了很多道道，已经能透过它看到桌子的边沿。桌子旁放着没有漆过的椅子，因为长期使用，已经被磨得很光亮了。第四面也是最后一面墙上有三扇窗户，从第一扇看出去景色是这样的。窗子正下方是一条路，路上的每一处坑洼、每一块卵石、每一道车辙，对我来说都十分熟悉和亲切。路边是一排酸橙树，透过这些树能看到一个树枝编成的篱笆和一片牧场；牧场的一边是一些农场建筑，另一边是树林——牧场深处，有守林人的小木屋，那是这一切的界限。右边的第二扇窗可以俯瞰到一部分平台，家里的“大人们”常常在那里吃午饭。有时候，当卡尔在批改我们的测试时，我便会向那扇窗外看，可以看到母亲的黑发和她旁边一些人的背部，还能听到他们低低的谈笑声。这时我便会为自己不能也在那里感到生气，我会想：“什么时候我才能长大呢？那样我就不用上课，就可以跟我喜欢的人们坐在一起，而不是背诵这些讨厌的对话了。”然后我的怒气便会转化为悲伤，我陷入那样的幻想中，连卡尔责备我犯错误的话也听不到了。</td>
		<td class="en">In the middle of the room stood a table, covered with a torn black oilcloth so much cut about with penknives that the edge of the table showed through.Round the table stood unpainted chairs which, through use, had attained a high degree of polish.The fourth and last wall contained three windows, from the first of which the view was as follows.Immediately beneath it there ran a high road on which every irregularity, every pebble, every rut was known and dear to me.Beside the road stretched a row of lime　trees, through which glimpses could be caught of a wattled fence, with a meadow with farm buildings on one side of it and a wood on the other—the whole bounded by the keeper’s hut at the further end of the meadow.The next window to the right overlooked the part of the terrace where the “grownups” of the family used to sit before luncheon.Sometimes, when Karl was correcting our exercises, I would look out of that window and see Mamma’s dark hair and the backs of some persons with her, and hear the murmur of their talking and laughter.Then I would feel vexed that I could not be there too, and think to myself, “When am I going to be grown up, and to have no more lessons, but sit with the people whom I love instead of with these horrid dialogues in my hand?”Then my anger would change to sadness, and I would fall into such a reverie that I never heard Karl when he scolded me for my mistakes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >总之，在我所说的这样一个早晨，卡尔脱下他的长袍，穿上那件肩头都是褶皱的蓝色上衣，对着镜子整一整领带，就领着我们下楼去向母亲问安了。</td>
		<td class="en">At last, on the morning of which I am speaking, Karl Ivanitch took off his dressing-gown, put on his blue frockcoat with its creased and crumpled shoulders, adjusted his tie before the looking-glass, and took us down to greet Mamma.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二章　母亲</td>
		<td class="en">CHAPTER II—MAMMA </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >母亲正坐在客厅里沏茶。她一手扶着茶壶，另一手正从茶壶里往外倒水，让水溢到了托盘里。虽然她似乎正专注于手上的活，但她并没注意到水溢出来了，也没注意到我们进来。</td>
		<td class="en">Mamma was sitting in the drawing-room and making tea.In one hand she was holding the tea-pot, while with the other one she was drawing water from the urn and letting it drip into the tray.Yet though she appeared to be noticing what she doing, in reality she noted neither this fact nor our entry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不管一个人对于过去的回忆多么鲜活，对于至亲的回忆却像透过眼泪看到的景象一样——暗淡而模糊。那些是想象的眼泪。我试着去回忆那时候的母亲，棕色的眼睛总是流露出关爱和慈善，脖子上、短短的发髻下有颗小痣，白色的绣花领，还有那双纤细柔软的双手，那双常常爱抚我、我也常常亲吻的手。但是，我总是无法记起母亲的整体形象。</td>
		<td class="en">However vivid be one’s recollection of the past, any attempt to recall the features of a beloved being shows them to one’s vision as through a mist of tears—dim and blurred.Those tears are the tears of the imagination.When I try to recall Mamma as she was then, I see, true, her brown eyes, expressive always of love and kindness, the small mole on her neck below where the small hairs grow, her white embroidered collar, and the delicate, fresh hand which so often caressed me, and which I so often kissed; but her general appearance escapes me altogether.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在沙发的右边有一架英国钢琴，我那黑头发的姐姐露博奇卡坐在那里，很努力地弹奏着“克莱门蒂”的练习曲（因为她的手刚在凉水中浸过，所以呈现出玫瑰红色）。她那时十一岁，穿着一件短的棉罩衫和带蕾丝花边的白裤子，只能用琵音弹奏八度音。她旁边坐着玛利亚·伊万诺芙娜，戴着装饰有粉色缎带的帽子，围着蓝色的围巾。她的脸色通红，满是怒气。卡尔·伊万内奇进来后，她脸上的表情就更严肃了。她生气地看着他，也不理会他的鞠躬，而是继续用脚打着拍子，一边数着：“一、二、三——一、二、三。”声音比以往更响亮，更专横。</td>
		<td class="en">To the left of the sofa stood an English piano, at which my dark-haired sister Lubotshka was sitting and playing with manifest effort (for her hands were rosy from a recent washing in cold water) Clementi’s “Etudes.”Then eleven years old, she was dressed in a short cotton frock and white lace-frilled trousers, and could take her octaves only in arpeggio.Beside her was sitting Maria Ivanovna, in a cap adorned with pink ribbons and a blue shawl. Her face was red and cross, and it assumed an expression even more severe when Karl Ivanitch entered the room.Looking angrily at him without answering his bow, she went on beating time with her foot and counting, “One, two, three—one, two, three,” more loudly and commandingly than ever.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >卡尔·伊万内奇并不理会她的粗鲁，而是照常用德国式的礼节去亲吻母亲的手。母亲站起身，摇了摇头，似乎这样就能驱走那些忧伤的想法，她向卡尔·伊万内奇伸出手，在卡尔弯下腰的时候吻了吻他布满皱纹的额角。“谢谢你，亲爱的卡尔·伊万内奇。”母亲用德语说。然后，她又用同一种语言询问我们（孩子们）睡得如何。卡尔·伊万内奇一只耳朵不灵光，而钢琴的声音更是让他什么都听不见了。他走近沙发，一手扶着桌子，一手举起头上的帽子，带着一种那些日子里我一直觉得礼貌得无懈可击的微笑说道：“纳塔莉娅·尼古拉耶芙娜，你会原谅我吧，对吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">Karl Ivanitch paid no attention to this rudeness, but went, as usual, with German politeness to kiss Mamma’s hand. She drew herself up, shook her head as though by the movement to chase away sad thoughts from her, and gave Karl her hand, kissing him on his wrinkled temple as he bent his head in salutation.“I thank you, dear Karl Ivanitch,” she said in German, and then, still using the same language asked him how we (the children) had slept.Karl Ivanitch was deaf in one ear, and the added noise of the piano now prevented him from hearing anything at all.He moved nearer to the sofa, and, leaning one hand upon the table and lifting his cap above his head, said with, a smile which in those days always seemed to me the perfection of politeness: “You, will excuse me, will you not, Natalia Nicolaevna?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他这样说是因为，为了避免感冒，卡尔从不拿掉他的红帽子，所以他每次进客厅都会毫无例外地请求允许他戴着帽子。</td>
		<td class="en">The reason for this was that, to avoid catching cold, Karl never took off his red cap, but invariably asked permission, on entering the drawing-room, to retain it on his head.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没事，戴着吧，卡尔·伊万内奇。”母亲说着，向他弯下腰，并提高了声音，“不过我问你孩子们睡得好不好？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, pray replace it, Karl Ivanitch,” said Mamma, bending towards him and raising her voice, “But I asked you whether the children had slept well?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但他还是没听见，而是重新在秃头上戴上了帽子，笑容更加灿烂了。</td>
		<td class="en">Still he did not hear, but, covering his bald head again with the red cap, went on smiling more than ever.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“停一下，米米。”母亲仍然笑着，对玛利亚·伊万诺芙娜说道，“这样根本什么都听不清。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Stop a moment, Mimi.” said Mamma (now smiling also) to Maria Ivanovna.“It is impossible to hear anything.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >母亲微笑着的时候，她的脸庞是那么美丽！她的笑容使得她更加迷人了，她身边的一切也似乎更加明亮！如果我在生命中那些痛苦的时刻能看到这样的笑容，大概就不会知道什么是悲伤了。我想，我们常说的美丽就在于人们的笑容。如果笑容使得这张脸更有魅力，那么这就是一张美丽的脸。如果笑容并没有使脸发生变化，那么这就是一张普通的脸。但如果笑容破坏了这张脸，那么这的确是张丑陋的脸了。</td>
		<td class="en">How beautiful Mamma’s face was when she smiled!It made her so infinitely more charming, and everything around her seemed to grow brighter!If in the more painful moments of my life I could have seen that smile before my eyes, I should never have known what grief is.In my opinion, it is in the smile of a face that the essence of what we call beauty lies.If the smile heightens the charm of the face, then the face is a beautiful one.If the smile does not alter the face, then the face is an ordinary one.But if the smile spoils the face, then the face is an ugly one indeed.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">He was standing near his writing-table, and pointing angrily to some envelopes, papers, and little piles of coin upon it as he addressed some observations to the bailiff, Jakoff Michaelovitch, who was standing in his usual place (that is to say, between the door and the barometer) and rapidly closing and unclosing the fingers of the hand which he held behind his back.The more angry Papa grew, the more rapidly did those fingers twirl, and when Papa ceased speaking they came to rest also.Yet, as soon as ever Jakoff himself began to talk, they flew here, there, and everywhere with lightning rapidity.These movements always appeared to me an index of Jakoff’s secret thoughts, though his face was invariably placid, and expressive alike of dignity and submissiveness, as who should say, “I am right, yet let it be as you wish.”On seeing us, Papa said, “Directly—wait a moment,” and looked towards the door as a hint for it to be shut.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“慈悲的上帝啊！你今天是怎么回事，雅科夫？”他耸了耸一边的肩膀（这是他的一个习惯）。“这信封装着800卢布，”——雅科夫拿出算盘，写下“800”，眼睛盯着着数字，等待着下文——“是用于我不在时的开销。你明白吗？从磨坊那里，你应该拿到1000卢布。不对吗？然后从国库那里你应该收到8000卢布的押金。干草那儿——按你的估计，应该能卖到7000普特（1普特＝40磅），按45戈比1普特算，能进账3000卢布。这样算下来你手头一共能有多少？——12000卢布。对吧？”“是的。”雅科夫回答道。但他的手指飞快地扭动着，我想他会提出异议。父亲继续说道：“那么，你从这些钱里取10000卢布寄给彼得洛夫斯科耶当地的委员会。至于帐房里那些钱，你去拿给我，就当是今天的支出吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Gracious heavens! What can be the matter with you today, Jakoff?” he went on with a hitch of one shoulder (a habit of his).“This envelope here with the 800 roubles enclosed,”—Jacob took out a set of tablets, put down “800” and remained looking at the figures while he waited for what was to come next—”is for expenses during my absence.Do you understand?From the mill you ought to receive 1000 roubles.Is not that so?And from the Treasury mortgage you ought to receive some 8000 roubles.From the hay—of which, according to your calculations, we shall be able to sell 7000 poods (The pood = 40 lbs.) at 45 copecks a piece there should come in 3000. Consequently the sum-total that you ought to have in hand soon is—how much?—12,000 roubles. Is that right?”“Precisely,” answered Jakoff. Yet by the extreme rapidity with which his fingers were twitching I could see that he had an objection to make.Papa went on: “Well, of this money you will send 10,000 roubles to the Petrovskoe local council, As for the money already at the office, you will remit it to me, and enter it as spent on this present date.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Next, when we came to our writing lesson, the tears kept falling from my eyes and, making a mess on the paper, as though some one had written on blotting-paper with water, Karl was very angry.He ordered me to go down upon my knees, declared that it was all obstinacy and “puppet-comedy playing” (a favourite expression of his) on my part, threatened me with the ruler, and commanded me to say that I was sorry.Yet for sobbing and crying I could not get a word out.At last—conscious, perhaps, that he was unjust—he departed to Nicola’s pantry, and slammed the door behind him.Nevertheless their conversation there carried to the schoolroom.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The man who now entered the room was about fifty years old, with a pale, attenuated face pitted with smallpox, long grey hair, and a scanty beard of a reddish hue.Likewise he was so tall that, on coming through the doorway, he was forced not only to bend his head, but to incline his whole body forward.He was dressed in a sort of smock that was much torn, and held in his hand a stout staff.As he entered he smote this staff upon the floor, and, contracting his brows and opening his mouth to its fullest extent, laughed in a dreadful, unnatural way.He had lost the sight of one eye, and its colourless pupil kept rolling about and imparting to his hideous face an even more repellent expression than it otherwise bore.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哈，抓到你了！”他大叫着，小步跑向沃洛达，抓住他的圆脑袋，仔细地看他的头顶。之后他带着无比严肃的表情离开了沃洛达，走向桌子，开始向油布底下吹气，还在油布上画十字。“哦，太可怜了！哦，真痛苦！它们生气了！它们从我这儿飞走了！”他怒视着沃洛达，一边大声哭喊着，一边用袖子擦去涌出的眼泪。他的嗓音粗重而刺耳，他的动作激动而狂乱，他的话语毫无意义又缺乏逻辑（他不用连词）。只是，那样的嗓音如此让人心碎，他枯黄丑陋的脸庞不时显示出如此诚挚又悲哀的神情，所以当听他讲话的时候，没有谁能克制住那种遗憾、悲伤而又恐惧的复杂心情。</td>
		<td class="en">“Hullo, you are caught!” he exclaimed as he ran to Woloda with little short steps and, seizing him round the head, looked at it searchingly.Next he left him, went to the table, and, with a perfectly serious expression on his face, began to blow under the oil-cloth, and to make the sign of the cross over it, “O-oh, what a pity!O-oh, how it hurts!They are angry!They fly from me!” he exclaimed in a tearful choking voice as he glared at Woloda and wiped away the streaming tears with his sleeve. His voice was harsh and rough, all his movements hysterical and spasmodic, and his words devoid of sense or connection (for he used no conjunctions).Yet the tone of that voice was so heartrending, and his yellow, deformed face at times so sincere and pitiful in its expression, that, as one listened to him, it was impossible to repress a mingled sensation of pity, grief, and fear.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这就是愚者格里沙。没有人知道他从哪里来，他的父母是谁，是什么让他过上了现在这种奇怪的生活。我只知道，从十五岁起，他就是大家所说的低能。不管冬夏他都赤着脚去修道院，把小圣像送给想要的人们，并说一些难懂的话，还被一些人当作预言。从来没有人见过他是另外的样子。有几次他曾去拜访外祖母家。有些人说他是被遗弃的富家子，有着纯净圣洁的灵魂；还有些人说他只是个懒惰的农夫。</td>
		<td class="en">This was the idiot Grisha.Whence he had come, or who were his parents, or what had induced him to choose the strange life which he led, no one ever knew.All that I myself knew was that from his fifteenth year upwards he had been known as an imbecile who went barefooted both in winter and summer, visited convents, gave little images to any one who cared to take them, and spoke meaningless words which some people took for prophecies; that nobody remembered him as being different; that at, rare intervals he used to call at Grandmamma’s house; and that by some people he was said to be the outcast son of rich parents and a pure, saintly soul, while others averred that he was a mere peasant and an idler.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >终于，一向守时的福卡在我们的苦苦等待中出现了，我们奔下楼去。格里沙跟着我们，还在抽泣着说着什么，用拐杖敲打着每一层台阶。我们走进客厅时看到父亲母亲正在走来走去，他们彼此握着手，低声交谈着。玛利亚·伊万诺芙娜直直地坐在与沙发呈直角的一张扶手椅上，给身边的两个女孩子讲着课。卡尔·伊万内奇进来的时候，她看了他一会儿，然后又把目光移开了，那神情似乎在说：“你根本不值得我注意，卡尔·伊万内奇。”女孩们的眼神显然在告诉我们，她们一有机会便会有重要的消息要跟我们讲（因为离开她们的座位，到我们这来，会违反米米的规定）。我们得先走到米米面前说：“您好，米米。”接着向她浅浅地鞠躬；然后才有可能被允许跟女孩子们说话。</td>
		<td class="en">At last the punctual and wished-for Foka arrived, and we went downstairs.Grisha followed us sobbing and continuing to talk nonsense, and knocking his staff on each step of the staircase.When we entered the drawing-room we found Papa and Mamma walking up and down there, with their hands clasped in each other’s, and talking in low tones.Maria Ivanovna was sitting bolt upright in an armchair placed at tight angles to the sofa, and giving some sort of a lesson to the two girls sitting beside her.When Karl Ivanitch entered the room she looked at him for a moment, and then turned her eyes away with an expression which seemed to say, “You are beneath my notice, Karl Ivanitch.”It was easy to see from the girls’ eyes that they had important news to communicate to us as soon as an opportunity occurred (for to leave their seats and approach us first was contrary to Mimi’s rules).It was for us to go to her and say, “Bon jour, Mimi,” and then make her a low bow; after which we should possibly be permitted to enter into conversation with the girls.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >米米实在是个让人无法忍受的女人！每个人在她面前说话，都能被她挑出错来。而且我们想用俄语说话时，她就会说：“说法语。”似乎有意要惹我们生气。午餐时，当我们想要安静地享用某道精美菜肴时，她仍会继续喋喋不休地说：“就着面包吃吧！”或者“你这叉子是怎么拿的？”“她跟我们到底有什么关系呢？”我常常想，“让她教女孩子们吧。我们有卡尔·伊万内奇。”我跟他在厌恶“某些人”方面十分地相似。</td>
		<td class="en">What an intolerable creature that Mimi was!One could hardly say a word in her presence without being found fault with.Also whenever we wanted to speak in Russian, she would say, “Parlez, donc, francais,” as though on purpose to annoy us, while, if there was any particularly nice dish at luncheon which we wished to enjoy in peace, she would keep on ejaculating, “Mangez, donc, avec du pain!” or, “Comment est-ce que vous tenez votre fourchette?”“What has SHE got to do with us?” I used to think to myself.“Let her teach the girls. WE have our Karl Ivanitch.”I shared to the full his dislike of “certain people.”</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Grisha likewise took a seat in the dining room, but at a little table apart from the rest.He never lifted his eyes from his plate, but kept on sighing and making horrible grimaces, as he muttered to himself: “What a pity!It has flown away!The dove is flying to heaven!The stone lies on the tomb!” and so forth.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">During dessert Jakoff had been sent for, and orders given him to have ready the carriage, the hounds, and the saddle-horses—every detail being minutely specified, and every horse called by its own particular name.As Woloda’s usual mount was lame, Papa ordered a “hunter” to be saddled for him; which term, “hunter” so horrified Mamma’s ears, that she imagined it to be some kind of an animal which would at once run away and bring about Woloda’s death.Consequently, in spite of all Papa’s and Woloda’s assurances (the latter glibly affirming that it was nothing, and that he liked his horse to go fast), poor Mamma continued to exclaim that her pleasure would be quite spoilt for her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >午餐结束后，大人们在书房里喝咖啡，我们小孩子便跑到花园里，踏着落满黄叶的蜿蜒小径，絮絮叨叨地说话。我们谈到了有关沃洛达要骑“猎手”的事，说露博奇卡没有卡简卡跑得快，是一件很丢人的事，还说如果能看到格里沙的链子就会是一件有趣的事等等。但是对于即将到来的离别，我们什么都没说。不过我们的谈话被马车到来的声音打断了，马车的每个弹簧座位上都坐着一个小农奴。马车的后面是骑着马的猎人们和猎狗，他们的后面是车夫伊格纳特，正骑着要给沃洛达的坐骑，而我的马在一边小跑着。我们跑到花园的栅栏边看到了这些有趣的场景，并沉浸在一片呼哨声和高喊声中。然后我们跑上楼去换衣服——目标就是要跟那些猎人们穿得越像越好。最好的方法就是把马裤塞进靴子里。我们立刻行动起来，因为我们都急着跑去门口看那些马和猎狗，好大饱眼福，并且还能跟猎人们聊聊天。那天非常温暖，从早晨起，形状奇特的云就在地平线上不断聚积，又在微风的吹拂下掠过太阳。很显然，虽然它们显示出可怕的黑色，但并不会带来暴风雨，也不会毁掉我们最后一天的快乐。到了午后，一些云开始消散，变成了白色的长条状，又沉到了地平线以下，而其他的则形成了透明的鳞片状。在东边的马斯洛夫卡上端，有一大块阴沉的乌云，但卡尔·伊万内奇（他似乎总能知道天上的状况）说天气会保持晴好和干燥。</td>
		<td class="en">When luncheon was over, the grown-ups had coffee in the study, while we younger ones ran into the garden and went chattering along the undulating paths with their carpet of yellow leaves.We talked about Woloda’s riding a hunter and said what a shame it was that Lubotshka, could not run as fast as Katenka, and what fun it would be if we could see Grisha’s chains, and so forth; but of the impending separation we said not a word.Our chatter was interrupted by the sound of the carriage driving up, with a village urchin perched on each of its springs.Behind the carriage rode the huntsmen with the hounds, and they, again, were followed by the groom Ignat on the steed intended for Woloda, with my old horse trotting alongside.After running to the garden fence to get a sight of all these interesting objects, and indulging in a chorus of whistling and hallooing, we rushed upstairs to dress—our one aim being to make ourselves look as like the huntsmen as possible.The obvious way to do this was to tuck one’s breeches inside one’s boots.We lost no time over it all, for we were in a hurry to run to the entrance steps again there to feast our eyes upon the horses and hounds, and to have a chat with the huntsmen.The day was exceedingly warm while, though clouds of fantastic shape had been gathering on the horizon since morning and driving before a light breeze across the sun, it was clear that, for all their menacing blackness, they did not really intend to form a thunderstorm and spoil our last day’s pleasure.Moreover, towards afternoon some of them broke, grew pale and elongated, and sank to the horizon again, while others of them changed to the likeness of white transparent fish-scales.In the east, over Maslovska, a single lurid mass was louring, but Karl Ivanitch (who always seemed to know the ways of the heavens) said that the weather would still continue to be fair and dry.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">In spite of his advanced years, it was in quite a sprightly manner that Foka came out to the entrance steps, to give the order “Drive up.”In fact, as he planted his legs firmly apart and took up his station between the lowest step and the spot where the coachman was to halt, his mien was that of a man who knew his duties and had no need to be reminded of them by anybody.Presently the ladies, also came out, and after a little discussions as to seats and the safety of the girls (all of which seemed to me wholly superfluous), they settled themselves in the vehicle, opened their parasols, and started.As the carriage was, driving away, Mamma pointed to the hunter and asked nervously “Is that the horse intended for Vladimir Petrovitch?”On the groom answering in the affirmative, she raised her hands in horror and turned her head away.As for myself, I was burning with impatience.Clambering on to the back of my steed (I was just tall enough to see between its ears), I proceeded to perform evolutions in the courtyard.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Although Woloda had plenty of pluck, he was not altogether free from apprehensions as he sat on the hunter.Indeed, he more than once asked as he patted it, “Is he quiet?”He looked very well on horseback—almost a grown-up young man, and held himself so upright in the saddle that I envied him since my shadow seemed to show that I could not compare with him in looks.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Arrived at a gate, Papa told us and the huntsmen to continue our way along the road, and then rode off across a cornfield.The harvest was at its height.On the further side of a large, shining, yellow stretch of cornland lay a high purple belt of forest which always figured in my eyes as a distant, mysterious region behind which either the world ended or an uninhabited waste began.This expanse of cornland was dotted with swathes and reapers, while along the lanes where the sickle had passed could be seen the backs of women as they stooped among the tall, thick grain or lifted armfuls of corn and rested them against the shocks.In one corner a woman was bending over a cradle, and the whole stubble was studded with sheaves and cornflowers.In another direction shirt-sleeved men were standing on waggons, shaking the soil from the stalks of sheaves, and stacking them for carrying.As soon as the foreman (dressed in a blouse and high boots, and carrying a tally-stick) caught sight of Papa, he hastened to take off his lamb’s-wool cap and, wiping his red head, told the women to get up.Papa’s chestnut horse went trotting along with a prancing gait as it tossed its head and swished its tail to and fro to drive away the gadflies and countless other insects which tormented its flanks, while his two greyhounds—their tails curved like sickles—went springing gracefully over the stubble.Milka was always first, but every now and then she would halt with a shake of her head to await the whipper-in.The chatter of the peasants; the rumbling of horses and waggons; the joyous cries of quails; the hum of insects as they hung suspended in the motionless air; the smell of the soil and grain and steam from our horses; the thousand different lights and shadows which the burning sun cast upon the yellowish-white cornland; the purple forest in the distance; the white gossamer threads which were floating in the air or resting on the soil-all these things I observed and heard and felt to the core.</td></tr>

I could see countless ants swarming over the parched grey earth and winding among the acorns, withered oak-leaves, dry twigs, russet moss, and slender, scanty blades of grass.In serried files they kept pressing forward on the level track they had made for themselves—some carrying burdens, some not.I took a piece of twig and barred their way.Instantly it was curious to see how they made light of the obstacle.Some got past it by creeping underneath, and some by climbing over it.A few, however, there were (especially those weighted with loads) who were nonplussed what to do.They either halted and searched for a way round, or returned whence they had come, or climbed the adjacent herbage, with the evident intention of reaching my hand and going up the sleeve of my jacket.From this interesting spectacle my attention was distracted by the yellow wings of a butterfly which was fluttering alluringly before me.Yet I had scarcely noticed it before it flew away to a little distance and, circling over some half-faded blossoms of white clover, settled on one of them.Whether it was the sun’s warmth that delighted it, or whether it was busy sucking nectar from the flower, at all events it seemed thoroughly comfortable.It scarcely moved its wings at all, and pressed itself down into the clover until I could hardly see its body.I sat with my chin on my hands and watched it with intense interest.</td></tr>

She did not turn round, but Woloda remarked without raising his head, “What spooniness!”I felt the tears rising to my eyes, and could not take my gaze from Katenka.I had long been used to her fair, fresh face, and had always been fond of her, but now I looked at her more closely, and felt more fond of her, than I had ever done or felt before.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们到家的时候，暮色已经降临。母亲在钢琴边坐下，而我们坐在桌旁，用铅笔和颜料画画。虽然我只有一块蓝色的颜料，但是我还是想要画一幅关于打猎的画。我以一种极为生动的方式画了一个蓝色的男孩骑着一匹蓝色的马——但是我停了下来，因为我不知道是不是可以画一只蓝色的兔子。我跑到书房去问父亲：“可能会有蓝色的兔子吗？”父亲正忙着看书，眼睛抬也不抬，但他立刻回答道：“可能有的，我的孩子，可能有。”于是我回到桌边画了一只蓝色的兔子，但随后我就觉得还是把它改成一丛蓝色的灌木好一些。但蓝色的灌木也没有使我满意，于是我又把它改成了一棵蓝色的树，然后又把树改成了一堆干草，直到一整张纸上都是模糊的蓝色。我生气地把画纸撕成碎片，跑到大扶手椅上想事情。</td>
		<td class="en">Twilight had set in when we reached home.Mamma sat down to the piano, and we to a table, there to paint and draw in colours and pencil.Though I had only one cake of colour, and it was blue, I determined to draw a picture of the hunt.In exceedingly vivid fashion I painted a blue boy on a blue horse, and—but here I stopped, for I was uncertain whether it was possible also to paint a blue hare.I ran to the study to consult Papa, and as he was busy reading he never lifted his eyes from his book when I asked, “Can there be blue hares?”but at once replied, “There can, my boy, there can.”Returning to the table I painted in my blue hare, but subsequently thought it better to change it into a blue bush.Yet the blue bush did not wholly please me, so I changed it into a tree, and then into a rick, until, the whole paper having now become one blur of blue, I tore it angrily in pieces, and went off to meditate in the large armchair.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >母亲正在弹奏菲尔德的第二协奏曲。菲尔德可以说是她的老师。我正在打着瞌睡，音乐声让我的眼前呈现出一片明亮，还有透明的梦境。接着她开始弹奏贝多芬的《悲怆奏鸣曲》，我立刻感到沉重、压抑又不安。母亲经常弹这两首曲子，所以我对它们给我带来的感觉记得十分清楚。那些感觉令我想起——想起什么呢？不知怎的，我似乎是在回忆一些从未发生的事情。我的对面就是书房的门，我看到雅科夫和几个留着长胡子、穿着长衫的人走了进去。然后门关上了。</td>
		<td class="en">Mamma was playing Field’s second concerto.Field, it may be said, had been her master.As I dozed, the music brought up before my imagination a kind of luminosity, with transparent dream-shapes.Next she played the “Sonate Pathetique” of Beethoven, and I at once felt heavy, depressed, and apprehensive.Mamma often played those two pieces, and therefore I well recollect the feelings they awakened in me.Those feelings were a reminiscence—of what?Somehow I seemed to remember something which had never been.Opposite to me lay the study door, and presently I saw Jakoff enter it, accompanied by several long-bearded men in kaftans.Then the door shut again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他们大概要开始谈生意或其他什么事情。”我想。我相信在那个书房里办理的事情是这个世界上最重要的事情。人们靠近那个房间时总是踮起脚尖，并压低声音讲话。这更加证实了我的想法。这时里面传来了父亲响亮的声音，我还闻到了雪茄的味道——那味道对我来说总是很具吸引力。在我接着打瞌睡的时候，我突然又听到一阵熟悉的靴子踩在地板上的声音。果然，我看到卡尔·伊万内奇踮着脚轻轻地走到书房门口，他带着一种忧郁却坚决的表情，手中拿着一份文件，轻轻地敲了敲门。书房的门开了，然后又在他身后关上了。</td>
		<td class="en">“Now they are going to begin some business or other,” I thought.I believed the affairs transacted in that study to be the most important ones on earth.This opinion was confirmed by the fact that people only approached the door of that room on tiptoe and speaking in whispers.Presently Papa’s resonant voice sounded within, and I also scented cigar smoke—always a very attractive thing to me.Next, as I dozed, I suddenly heard a creaking of boots that I knew, and, sure enough, saw Karl Ivanitch go on tiptoe, and with a depressed, but resolute, expression on his face and a written document in his hand, to the study door and knock softly.It opened, and then shut again behind him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“希望别发生什么事。”我心想，“卡尔·伊万内奇如果被惹到了，也许什么事都做得出来——”我又打起瞌睡来。</td>
		<td class="en">“I hope nothing is going to happen,” I mused.“Karl Ivanitch is offended, and might be capable of anything—” and again I dozed off.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而真的有事情发生了。一个小时后我被同样的靴子声吵醒了。我看到卡尔从书房出来，走上楼去。他一边用手帕擦去脸上的眼泪，一边嘴里喃喃地说着什么。跟着父亲也走出书房，转进了客厅。</td>
		<td class="en">Nevertheless something DID happen.An hour later I was disturbed by the same creaking of boots, and saw Karl come out, and disappear up the stairs, wiping away a few tears from his cheeks with his pocket handkerchief as he went and muttering something between his teeth.Papa came out behind him and turned aside into the drawing room.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你知道我刚刚做了什么决定吗？”他快乐地问道，一只手搭在母亲的肩膀上。</td>
		<td class="en">“Do you know what I have just decided to do?” he asked gaily as he laid a hand upon Mamma’s shoulder.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“什么，亲爱的？”</td>
		<td class="en">“What, my love?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“让卡尔·伊万内奇跟孩子们一起走。马车里有足够的地方给他。孩子们已经习惯他了，而他也舍不得孩子们。一年七百卢布对我们来说也不算什么，而那可怜的魔鬼也绝对不是一个坏家伙。”我不明白为什么父亲要这样无礼地说卡尔。</td>
		<td class="en">“To take Karl Ivanitch with the children.There will be room enough for him in the carriage.They are used to him, and he seems greatly attached to them.Seven hundred roubles a year cannot make much difference to us, and the poor devil is not at all a bad sort of a fellow.”I could not understand why Papa should speak of him so disrespectfully.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我很高兴。”母亲说，“为卡尔，也为孩子们高兴。他是个很不错的老人。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I am delighted,” said Mamma, “and as much for the children’s sake as his own. He is a worthy old man.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我对他说他可以收下500卢布作为礼物，你真该看看他当时感动的样子！但最有意思的是这张他刚刚给我的单子，你真该看一看。”父亲笑着把一张卡尔手写的单子递给母亲。“难道不是很好吗？”他说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“I wish you could have seen how moved he was when I told him that he might look upon the 500 roubles as a present!But the most amusing thing of all is this bill which he has just handed me. It is worth seeing,” and with a smile Papa gave Mamma a paper inscribed in Karl’s handwriting.“Is it not capital?” he concluded.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那张纸条上的内容如下：（这张单子的有趣之处主要在于，那些字是用很差劲的俄语写成的，单复数、介词等等的错误通篇不断。）</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果根据这张清单来判断（在这张清单里卡尔·伊万内奇要求付清他花在礼物上的钱，并支付曾答应给他的礼物的钱），人们也许会认为卡尔是个无情贪婪的利己主义者，但他们错了。</td>
		<td class="en">If people were to judge only by this bill (in which Karl Ivanitch demanded repayment of all the money he had spent on presents, as well as the value of a present promised to himself), they would take him to have been a callous, avaricious egotist yet they would be wrong.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他拿着那张账单，并准备好了一番说辞进了书房，似乎是想跟父亲好好地谈一谈他在我家所遭受的不公平待遇。但一旦他开始用给我们做听写时的那种颤抖的、富于表达的语调讲话时，他那番话反而先在自己身上起了作用。于是，当他说到“不管我和孩子们的分别会有多痛苦”时，他完全失去了控制，说话时有些喘不过气来，所以不得不从口袋里掏出那块彩色的手帕来。</td>
		<td class="en">It appears that he had entered the study with the paper in his hand and a set speech in his head, for the purpose of declaiming eloquently to Papa on the subject of the wrongs which he believed himself to have suffered in our house, but that, as soon as ever he began to speak in the vibratory voice and with the expressive intonations which he used in dictating to us, his eloquence wrought upon himself more than upon Papa; with the result that, when he came to the point where he had to say, “however sad it will be for me to part with the children,” he lost his self-command utterly, his articulation became choked, and he was obliged to draw his coloured pocket-handkerchief from his pocket.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，彼得·亚力山德雷奇，”他哭着说（这一段并不是事先准备好的），“我跟孩子们已经习惯了，如果没有他们，我根本不知道该怎么办。我宁愿不要工资也要继续干这份工作。”他一手擦着眼泪，一手递上了那张账单。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, Peter Alexandrovitch,” he said, weeping (this formed no part of the prepared speech), “I am grown so used to the children that I cannot think what I should do without them.I would rather serve you without salary than not at all,” and with one hand he wiped his eyes, while with the other he presented the bill.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >虽然我很肯定卡尔当时说的完全是真心话（因为我知道他是多么善良），但直到今天我还是没法把他的话跟那张账单统一起来。</td>
		<td class="en">Although I am convinced that at that moment Karl Ivanitch was speaking with absolute sincerity (for I know how good his heart was), I confess that never to this day have I been able quite to reconcile his words with the bill.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“好啦，如果离开我们的想法使你感到悲伤，那么请你相信，把你解雇了我会感到同样悲伤。”父亲说道，轻轻地拍了拍他的肩膀。然后，他停了停，继续说道：“但我改变主意了，你不用离开我们了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, if the idea of leaving us grieves you, you may be sure that the idea of dismissing you grieves me equally,” said Papa, tapping him on the shoulder.Then, after a pause, he added, “But I have changed my mind, and you shall not leave us.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >晚饭开始前，格里沙走进房间。自从那天他来到我们家起，他就没停止过叹气和哭泣——在那些相信他具有预言能力的人们看来，这是一个凶兆，我们家会遭到不幸。他是来跟我们告别的，因为明天（像他说的）他必须赶路了。我用胳膊肘推了推沃洛达，然后一起向门外走去。</td>
		<td class="en">Just before supper Grisha entered the room.Ever since he had entered the house that day he had never ceased to sigh and weep—a portent, according to those who believed in his prophetic powers, that misfortune was impending for the household.He had now come to take leave of us, for tomorrow (so he said) he must be moving on.I nudged Woloda, and we moved towards the door.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在浓重的黑暗里，我们都感到有些不安，于是我们紧挨着彼此，什么都没说。不一会儿，格里沙就悄悄地走进来了，他一手拄着拐杖，一手拿着插在黄铜烛台上的牛脂蜡烛。我们几乎不敢呼吸。</td>
		<td class="en">We all felt a little uneasy in the thick darkness, so we pressed close to one another and said nothing.Before long Grisha arrived with his soft tread, carrying in one hand his staff and in the other a tallow candle set in a brass candlestick.We scarcely ventured to breathe.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们的基督耶稣！神圣的圣母！圣父，圣子，圣灵！”他依旧重复着那些话，用的是对于那些总是念叨这些话的人所特有的语调和略语。</td>
		<td class="en">“Our Lord Jesus Christ! Holy Mother of God!Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!” he kept repeating, with the different intonations and abbreviations which gradually become peculiar to persons who are accustomed to pronounce the words with great frequency.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他没有停止祈祷，而是把拐杖放到角落里，向床上看了看，然后开始脱衣服。他解掉那条破旧的黑腰带，然后缓缓地脱掉了破旧的黄色长衫，小心地把它挂在椅背上。他的脸上已经没有了平时的那种慌张和愚蠢。相反，他的脸上呈现出某种平静的、若有所思的、甚至是庄严的神情。他的举动沉着果断。</td>
		<td class="en">Still praying, he placed his staff in a corner and looked at the bed; after which he began to undress.Unfastening his old black girdle, he slowly divested himself of his torn nankeen kaftan, and deposited it carefully on the back of a chair.His face had now lost its usual disquietude and idiocy.On the contrary, it had in it something restful, thoughtful, and even grand, while all his movements were deliberate and intelligent.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接着，他穿着衬衣安静地躺在床上，在自己的每一面都画了个十字，然后调整了一下衬衣下面的链子——从他脸上的表情看，这个举动似乎相当痛苦。然后他又坐起来，严肃地看着他那件破衬衣。随后他又站起来端起烛台，把它举向供着神像的神龛。做完后，他又画了个十字，然后把蜡烛翻转过来，蜡烛“滋”地一声熄灭了。</td>
		<td class="en">Next, he lay down quietly in his shirt on the bed, made the sign of the cross towards every side of him, and adjusted his chains beneath his shirt—an operation which, as we could see from his face, occasioned him considerable pain.Then he sat up again, looked gravely at his ragged shirt, and rising and taking the candle, lifted the latter towards the shrine where the images of the saints stood.That done, he made the sign of the cross again, and turned the candle upside down, when it went out with a hissing noise.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >月光（几乎是满月）从窗户（可以俯瞰树林）照进来，愚者那高高的白色身影一边沐浴在苍白的银色月光下，另一边隐没在阴影里，从地板延伸到墙壁，一直到天花板。院子里，守夜人一下一下地敲打着他的黄铜警告板。格里沙安静地在圣像前站了一会儿，大手放在胸前，低着头，不时地叹息着。然后他费力地跪下去，开始祈祷。</td>
		<td class="en">Through the window (which overlooked the wood) the moon (nearly full) was shining in such a way that one side of the tall white figure of the idiot stood out in the pale, silvery moonlight, while the other side was lost in the dark shadow which covered the floor, walls, and ceiling.In the courtyard the watchman was tapping at intervals upon his brass alarm plate.For a while Grisha stood silently before the images and, with his large hands pressed to his breast and his head bent forward, gave occasional sighs.Then with difficulty he knelt down and began to pray.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一开始他重复了一些常见的祷辞，只是不时地强调一下某个词。然后他继续重复同样的祷辞，但是更加响亮，更有精神。最后他又重复了一遍，更加有所强调，还努力地想用古斯拉夫教堂语来发音。虽然他的祈祷支离破碎，但是很感人。他为他的恩人（他这样称呼那些曾好心收留过他的人们）祈祷，包括母亲和我们。接着他开始为自己祈祷，恳求上帝宽恕他的过错，同时还不断念着：“主啊，也请宽恕我的敌人吧！”然后，他费力地呻吟着站了起来——但又重新跪下，再次开始重复那些祷辞。最后他终于克服链子的重量站了起来。链子撞击到地板上发出刺耳的“哗啦哗啦”声。</td>
		<td class="en">At first he repeated some well-known prayers, and only accented a word here and there.Next, he repeated thee same prayers, but louder and with increased accentuation.Lastly he repeated them again and with even greater emphasis, as well as with an evident effort to pronounce them in the old Slavonic Church dialect.Though disconnected, his prayers were very touching.He prayed for all his benefactors (so he called every one who had received him hospitably), with, among them, Mamma and ourselves.Next he prayed for himself, and besought God to forgive him his sins, at the same time repeating, “God forgive also my enemies!”Then, moaning with the effort, he rose from his knees—only to fall to the floor again and repeat his phrases afresh.At last he regained his feet, despite the weight of the chains, which rattled loudly whenever they struck the floor.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >沃洛达在我的大腿上狠狠掐了一下，但我根本没注意到（只是不自觉地用手揉了揉那儿）。我以孩子特有的好奇、同情和尊敬，关注着格里沙的一举一动。进入这个储藏室时，我以为我们会得到欢笑和消遣，但现在，我只觉得心跳得厉害，十分压抑。</td>
		<td class="en">Woloda pinched me rudely in the leg, but I took no notice of that (except that I involuntarily touched the place with my hand), as I observed with a feeling of childish astonishment, pity, and respect the words and gestures of Grisha.Instead of the laughter and amusement which I had expected on entering the store room, I felt my heart beating and overcome.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >格里沙的宗教狂热又持续了一段时间，然后他换成了即兴的祷辞一遍遍念道：“主啊，可怜可怜我吧！”每次他说“原谅我吧，主，教教我应该怎么做”的时候，声音更加急切沉重，似乎是期待他的请求能立刻能得到回答，但随即又开始抽泣悲叹。最后，他再次跪下，双手在胸前交叉，沉默不语。我试着把头探到门边（这样做的时候我屏住呼吸），但格里沙还是没有什么动作，只是重重地叹气，胸口剧烈地起伏着。月光下，我看到一滴眼泪在他失明的那只眼睛上白色的眼罩上闪耀着。</td>
		<td class="en">Grisha continued for some time in this state of religious ecstasy as he improvised prayers and repeated again and yet again, “Lord, have mercy upon me!”Each time that he said, “Pardon me, Lord, and teach me to do what Thou wouldst have done,” he pronounced the words with added earnestness and emphasis, as though he expected an immediate answer to his petition, and then fell to sobbing and moaning once more.Finally, he went down on his knees again, folded his arms upon his breast, and remained silent.I ventured to put my head round the door (holding my breath as I did so), but Grisha still made no movement except for the heavy sighs which heaved his breast.In the moonlight I could see a tear glistening on the white patch of his blind eye.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，你的旨意会完成的！”他突然大喊起来，带着我无法描述的表情。他前额着地拜倒，像个孩子一样哭起来。</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, Thy will be done!” he exclaimed suddenly, with an expression which I cannot describe, as, prostrating himself with his forehead on the floor, he fell to sobbing like a child.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >时光荏苒，关于过去的很多记忆都已经从我的脑海中淡去或化成一副模糊不清的模样。而格里沙也早就完成了他的朝圣之旅；但他留给我的印象，还有他所唤起的我心底的情愫，我永远也不会忘记。哦，虔诚的基督教徒格里沙，你的信念如此坚定，让你可以感到上帝的真实存在；你的爱如此强烈，使得言语可以自然地从你的唇间流露而出。你不需要证实它们，因为当你伏在地上哭泣、找不到言语来表达的时候，献给上帝的就是最真挚的歌颂！</td>
		<td class="en">Much sand has run out since then, many recollections of the past have faded from my memory or become blurred in indistinct visions, and poor Grisha himself has long since reached the end of his pilgrimage; but the impression which he produced upon me, and the feelings which he aroused in my breast, will never leave my mind.O truly Christian Grisha, your faith was so strong that you could feel the actual presence of God; your love so great that the words fell of themselves from your lips.You had no reason to prove them, for you did so with your earnest praises of His majesty as you fell to the ground speechless and in tears!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过我听格里沙祈祷时的敬畏心情并未持续很久。我的好奇心已经得到了满足，加上保持一个姿势坐了很久，腿都麻了，所以现在我想加入身后那个黑暗的储藏室里的嗤笑和娱乐中去。有人抓住了我的手，低声问道：“这是谁的手？”虽然很黑，我还是通过触感和那低低的嗓音辨认出那是卡简卡。我抓住她的胳膊，但是她挣脱了，还碰倒了旁边的一个藤椅。格里沙抬起头，安静地向他周围看了看，然后他喃喃念着祷文，站起身来，向房间的四个角落各划了一个十字。</td>
		<td class="en">Nevertheless the sense of awe with which I had listened to Grisha could not last for ever.I had now satisfied my curiosity, and, being cramped with sitting in one position so long, desired to join in the tittering and fun which I could hear going on in the dark store room behind me.Some one took my hand and whispered, “Whose hand is this?”Despite the darkness, I knew by the touch and the low voice in my ear that it was Katenka.I took her by the arm, but she withdrew it, and, in doing so, pushed a cane chair which was standing near.Grisha lifted his head looked quietly about him, and, muttering a prayer, rose and made the sign of the cross towards each of the four corners of the room.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">In days gone by there used to run about the seignorial courtyard of the country house at Chabarovska a girl called Natashka.She always wore a cotton dress, went barefooted, and was rosy, plump, and gay.It was at the request and entreaties of her father, the clarionet player Savi, that my grandfather had “taken her upstairs”—that is to say, made her one of his wife’s female servants.As chamber-maid, Natashka so distinguished herself by her zeal and amiable temper that when Mamma arrived as a baby and required a nurse Natashka was honoured with the charge of her.In this new office the girl earned still further praises and rewards for her activity, trustworthiness, and devotion to her young mistress.Soon, however, the powdered head and buckled shoes of the young and active footman Foka (who had frequent opportunities of courting her, since they were in the same service) captivated her unsophisticated, but loving, heart.At last she ventured to go and ask my grandfather if she might marry Foka, but her master took the request in bad part, flew into a passion, and punished poor Natashka by exiling her to a farm which he owned in a remote quarter of the Steppes.At length, when she had been gone six months and nobody could be found to replace her, she was recalled to her former duties.Returned, and with her dress in rags, she fell at Grandpapa’s feet, and besought him to restore her his favour and kindness, and to forget the folly of which she had been guilty—folly which, she assured him, should never recur again.And she kept her word.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">The Iwins were related to us, and of about the same age as ourselves.We had made their acquaintance soon after our arrival in Moscow.The second brother, Seriosha, had dark curly hair, a turned-up, strongly pronounced nose, very bright red lips (which, never being quite shut, showed a row of white teeth), beautiful dark-blue eyes, and an uncommonly bold expression of face.He never smiled but was either wholly serious or laughing a clear, merry, agreeable laugh.His striking good looks had captivated me from the first, and I felt an irresistible attraction towards him.Only to see him filled me with pleasure, and at one time my whole mental faculties used to be concentrated in the wish that I might do so.If three or four days passed without my seeing him I felt listless and ready to cry.Awake or asleep, I was forever dreaming of him.On going to bed I used to see him in my dreams, and when I had shut my eyes and called up a picture of him I hugged the vision as my choicest delight.So much store did I set upon this feeling for my friend that I never mentioned it to any one.Nevertheless, it must have annoyed him to see my admiring eyes constantly fixed upon him, or else he must have felt no reciprocal attraction, for he always preferred to play and talk with Woloda.Still, even with that I felt satisfied, and wished and asked for nothing better than to be ready at any time to make any sacrifice for him.Likewise, over and above the strange fascination which he exercised upon me, I always felt another sensation, namely, a dread of making him angry, of offending him, of displeasing him.Was this because his face bore such a haughty expression, or because I, despising my own exterior, over-rated the beautiful in others, or, lastly (and most probably), because it is a common sign of affection?At all events, I felt as much fear, of him as I did love.The first time that he spoke to me I was so overwhelmed with sudden happiness that I turned pale, then red, and could not utter a word.He had an ugly habit of blinking when considering anything seriously, as well as of twitching his nose and eyebrows.Consequently every one thought that this habit marred his face.Yet I thought it such a nice one that I involuntarily adopted it for myself, until, a few days after I had made his acquaintance, Grandmamma suddenly asked me whether my eyes were hurting me, since I was winking like an owl!Never a word of affection passed between us, yet he felt his power over me, and unconsciously but tyrannically, exercised it in all our childish intercourse.I used to long to tell him all that was in my heart, yet was too much afraid of him to be frank in any way, and, while submitting myself to his will, tried to appear merely careless and indifferent.Although at times his influence seemed irksome and intolerable, to throw it off was beyond my strength.</td></tr>

Indeed, he enjoyed—especially among the ladies—the reputation of being a very accomplished fellow.In the second place, he wore a reddish moustache, a large gold pin set with a ruby, a black satin tie, and a very fashionable suit.Lastly, he was young, with a handsome, self-satisfied face and fine muscular legs.It was clear that he set the greatest store upon the latter, and thought them beyond compare, especially as regards the favour of the ladies.Consequently, whether sitting or standing, he always tried to exhibit them in the most favourable light.In short, he was a type of the young German-Russian whose main desire is to be thought perfectly gallant and gentlemanly.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在我们回到莫斯科的时候，外祖母才得知这个噩耗，悲痛万分。开始时我们都不被允许见她，因为整整一个礼拜她都神志不清，医生也为她的生命担心。她不仅拒绝吃任何药，不跟任何人讲话，也不吃东西，并且一直没合眼。有时，她独自坐在房间里的扶手椅上，突然就开始又哭又笑，带着空洞的悲伤，没有眼泪。一时又转为痉挛，用恐怖的声音叫喊着一些可怕的、不连贯的话。这是她生命中遭遇到的第一次致命的打击，简直要让她精神错乱了。她指责一个又一个人，说是他们给她带来了这个不幸，用最狠毒的话咒骂他们。最后她从扶手椅上站起来，开始在房间里踱步，直到最后昏倒在地板上。有一次，我去她房间的时候，她似乎正安静地坐在椅子上，但她古怪的神情让我很好奇。虽然她的眼睛大睁着，视线却是茫然而空洞的，她似乎是盯着我的方向，但并没有看到我。突然她张开嘴唇，缓缓地露出一个微笑，然后用温柔而动人的声音说道：“过来吧，我最亲爱的孩子，过来，我的天使。”我想她应该是在叫我，于是我走向她，但那时她并没有看着我。“哦，我亲爱的孩子，”她继续说道，“如果你能知道我是多么困扰，如果你能知道再见到你我有多么开心！”我意识到她以为她正看到的是母亲，于是我站住了。“他们告诉我说你去世了，”她皱皱眉总结道，“一派胡言！你怎么可能在我之前死呢！”她歇斯底里地狂笑起来。</td>
		<td class="en">Grandmamma received the sad tidings only on our return to her house, and her grief was extraordinary.At first we were not allowed to see her, since for a whole week she was out of her mind, and the doctors were afraid for her life.Not only did she decline all medicine whatsoever, but she refused to speak to anybody or to take nourishment, and never closed her eyes in sleep.Sometimes, as she sat alone in the armchair in her room, she would begin laughing and crying at the same time, with a sort of tearless grief, or else relapse into convulsions, and scream out dreadful, incoherent words in a horrible voice.It was the first dire sorrow which she had known in her life, and it reduced her almost to distraction.She would begin accusing first one person, and then another, of bringing this misfortune upon her, and rail at and blame them with the most extraordinary virulence. Finally she would rise from her armchair, pace the room for a while, and end by falling senseless to the floor.Once, when I went to her room, she appeared to be sitting quietly in her chair, yet with an air which struck me as curious.Though her eyes were wide open, their glance was vacant and meaningless, and she seemed to gaze in my direction without seeing me.Suddenly her lips parted slowly in a smile, and she said in a touchingly, tender voice: “Come here, then, my dearest one; come here, my angel.”Thinking that it was myself she was addressing, I moved towards her, but it was not I whom she was beholding at that moment.“Oh, my love,” she went on, “if only you could know how distracted I have been, and how delighted I am to see you once more!”I understood then that she believed herself to be looking upon Mamma, and halted where I was.“They told me you were gone,” she concluded with a frown; “but what nonsense!As if you could die before me!” and she laughed a terrible, hysterical laugh.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">With Mamma’s death the happy time of my childhood came to an end, and a new epoch—the epoch of my boyhood—began; but since my memories of Natalia Savishna (who exercised such a strong and beneficial influence upon the bent of my mind and the development of my sensibility) belong rather to the first period, I will add a few words about her and her death before closing this portion of my life.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我后来听她村子里的人说，我们返回莫斯科后，她觉得时光漫长，无事可做。虽然那些橱柜和架子仍归她管，她也不停地将它们整理了又整理——把里面的东西拿出来，再重新放回去——她仍悲伤地怀念着主人大宅里的喧闹和活跃，那是她自孩提时代起就熟悉的氛围。终于，悲痛、生活模式的转变、加上终日无事可做，她病倒了，而且几乎就要向病魔屈服了。 </td>
		<td class="en">I heard later from people in the village that, after our return to Moscow, she found time hang very heavy on her hands.Although the drawers and shelves were still under her charge, and she never ceased to arrange and rearrange them—to take things out and to dispose of them afresh—she sadly missed the din and bustle of the seignorial mansion to which she had been accustomed from her childhood up.Consequently grief, the alteration in her mode of life, and her lack of activity soon combined to develop in her a malady to which she had always been more or less subject.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >母亲去世后不到一年，她就得了水肿，卧床不起了。我能想象继续活着对她来说有多么痛苦，但如果在彼得洛夫斯科耶庄园里那座空荡荡的大房子里孤独地死去，身边没有一个亲人甚至没有一个人，那会更痛苦。虽然家里的每个人都敬重她，喜欢她，但她在那里没有建立什么亲密的友谊，并以此为傲。因为她担负着主人的信任，在她手下有那么多财产，她觉得亲密的关系会带来罪恶的纵容和迁就。所以，她就跟其他仆人保持着一定距离（或许也因为她跟他们真的完全不同）。她曾说“在这个房子里，她既不认亲戚也不认教父，关于主人财产的问题没有人能够例外。”相反，她在对上帝热切的祈祷中寻求安慰。不过在那些我们所有人都会遇到的脆弱时刻，最好的安慰还是同伴的眼泪和同情。每当这时，她便会把她的那条老狗摩斯卡带到床上，对它讲话，对着它默默地流泪；而那条狗会舔舔她的手来回应她的爱抚，用黄色的眼睛凝视着她。当摩斯卡呜咽的时候，她试图让它安静下来，说着：“够了，够了！不用你告诉我，我也知道我的死期临近了！”纳塔莉娅去世前的一个月，她从她橱柜的箱子里拿出一些上好的白棉布、白麻纱、粉丝带，然后在女仆的帮助下，做成了她希望穿着下葬的衣服。接着她将她架子上的东西都整理好，上交给管家一份她一丝不苟写好的清单。她自己留下的是几件丝绸长袍、一条旧披巾、以及外祖父的军装——这些东西都是完全交由她处置的，并且由于她很细心、整洁，这些东西都保存得十分完好——特别是军装上那漂亮的金色刺绣。</td>
		<td class="en">Scarcely more than a year after Mamma’s death dropsy showed itself, and she took to her bed.I can imagine how sad it must have been for her to go on living—still more, to die—alone in that great empty house at Petrovskoe, with no relations or anyone near her.Everyone there esteemed and loved her, but she had formed no intimate friendships in the place, and was rather proud of the fact.That was because, enjoying her master’s confidence as she did, and having so much property under her care, she considered that intimacies would lead to culpable indulgence and condescension. Consequently (and perhaps, also, because she had nothing really in common with the other servants) she kept them all at a distance, and used to say that she “recognised neither kinsman nor godfather in the house, and would permit of no exceptions with regard to her master’s property.”Instead, she sought and found consolation in fervent prayers to God.Yet sometimes, in those moments of weakness to which all of us are subject, and when man’s best solace is the tears and compassion of his fellow-creatures, she would take her old dog Moska on to her bed, and talk to it, and weep softly over it as it answered her caresses by licking her hands, with its yellow eyes fixed upon her.When Moska began to whine she would say as she quieted it: “Enough, enough!I know without thy telling me that my time is near.”A month before her death she took out of her chest of drawers some fine white calico, white cambric, and pink ribbon, and, with the help of the maidservants, fashioned the garments in which she wished to be buried.Next she put everything on her shelves in order and handed the bailiff an inventory which she had made out with scrupulous accuracy.All that she kept back was a couple of silk gowns, an old shawl, and Grandpapa’s military uniform—things which had been presented to her absolutely, and which, thanks to her care and orderliness, were in an excellent state of preservation—particularly the handsome gold embroidery on the uniform.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >弥留之际，她说她希望那两件丝绸长袍中粉色的一件，做成睡袍给沃洛达；另一件彩色的，做成差不多的睡袍给我；那条围巾，是留给露博奇卡的。至于军装，就看沃洛达和我谁先做了军官，就给谁。她的剩余财产（除了拿出四十卢布作为超度灵魂仪式和葬礼的支出）留给她的弟弟。他在一个遥远的省份里过着耽于酒色的生活，在她有生之年根本毫无来往。在他最后过来接受遗产时，发现票据上显示一共只有二十五卢布时，他根本不肯相信。他说她的姐姐在有钱人家独掌财务，干了六十年，而且她生活节俭，从不浪费一丝一毫，不可能只留下这么一点钱。但这就是事实。</td>
		<td class="en">Just before her death, again, she expressed a wish that one of the gowns (a pink one) should be made into a robe de chambre for Woloda; that the other one (a many-coloured gown) should be made into a similar garment for myself; and that the shawl should go to Lubotshka.As for the uniform, it was to devolve either to Woloda or to myself, according as the one or the other of us should first become an officer.All the rest of her property (save only forty roubles, which she set aside for her commemorative rites and to defray the costs of her burial) was to pass to her brother, a person with whom, since he lived a dissipated life in a distant province, she had had no intercourse during her lifetime.When, eventually, he arrived to claim the inheritance, and found that its sum-total only amounted to twenty-five roubles in notes, he refused to believe it, and declared that it was impossible that his sister—a woman who for sixty years had had sole charge in a wealthy house, as well as all her life had been penurious and averse to giving away even the smallest thing should have left no more: yet it was a fact.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >纳塔莉娅的病折磨了她两个月，她以真正基督教徒的勇气，承担着这份痛苦。她既不烦躁也不抱怨，而是像往常一样不断地向上帝祈祷。在死前的一个小时，她做了最后的自白，平静快乐地接受了圣餐，又进行了临终涂油仪式。然后她请家里每个人原谅她也许曾经犯下的错误，并让神父告诉我们，她无数次感激我们给她的爱，以及临终前她如何祈求我们的原谅，原谅她也许曾经所做的无意的冒犯。“我从没做过贼，从没拿过不属于自己的一针一线。”这是她所看重自己的唯一品质。</td>
		<td class="en">Though Natalia’s last illness lasted for two months, she bore her sufferings with truly Christian fortitude.Never did she fret or complain, but, as usual, appealed continually to God.An hour before the end came she made her final confession, received the Sacrament with quiet joy, and was accorded extreme unction.Then she begged forgiveness of every one in the house for any wrong she might have done them, and requested the priest to send us word of the number of times she had blessed us for our love of her, as well as of how in her last moments she had implored our forgiveness if, in her ignorance, she had ever at any time given us offence.“Yet a thief have I never been.Never have I used so much as a piece of thread that was not my own.”Such was the one quality which she valued in herself.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Dressed in the cap and gown prepared so long beforehand, and with her head resting, upon the cushion made for the purpose, she conversed with the priest up to the very last moment, until, suddenly, recollecting that she had left him nothing for the poor, she took out ten roubles, and asked him to distribute them in the parish.Lastly she made the sign of the cross, lay down, and expired—pronouncing with a smile of joy the name of the Almighty.</td></tr>
