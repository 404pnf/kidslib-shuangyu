		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哎呀，胡说！”男孩气愤地回答，“你看着办吧！</td>
		<td class="en">‘Oh, nonsense!’ replied the boy angrily, ‘do as you see.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >反正是你的皮，不是我的；我才不在意它会怎样呢！”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他昂着头，继续快速地往前走。</td>
		<td class="en">And he walked quickly on with his head in the air.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >熊等着，直到他从视线中消失，然后慢慢地跟着他，因为在它内心，它觉得男孩的忠告是好的，尽管它太骄傲而不愿意这样说。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不一会儿，男孩就对一直沿着这条路走感到厌烦了，便转弯进了树林，那里有灌木丛，他跳得过去，有溪流，他趟得过去；但是，他还没走多远就碰到了狼。</td>
		<td class="en">The boy soon grew tired of walking along the road, and turned off into the woods, where there were bushes he could jump and streams he could wade; but he had not gone far before he met the wolf.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你到哪儿去啊？”他问，因为这不是他第一次看到它了。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Where are you going?’ asked he, for it was not the first time he had seen him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，只是去参加磨坊主的婚礼，”狼回答，正如之前熊回答他的一样，</td>
		<td class="en">‘Oh, just to the miller’s marriage,’ answered the wolf, as the bear had done before him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“太无聊了，当然——婚礼总是乏味恼人的；但至少磨坊主是温厚善良的。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘It is rather tiresome, of course—weddings are always so stupid; but still one must be good-natured!’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不要去！”男孩再次说道，</td>
		<td class="en">‘Don’t go!’ said the boy again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你的皮这么厚，这么暖和，现在离冬天不远了。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Your skin is so thick and warm, and winter is not far off now.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们会杀了你，剥了你的皮。”</td>
		<td class="en">They will kill you, and strip it from you.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >狼惊讶地张大了嘴巴，下巴像掉下来一样。</td>
		<td class="en">The wolf’s jaw dropped in astonishment and terror.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你真认为那会发生吗？”它喘着气。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Do you really think that would happen?’ he gasped.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对，当然，我肯定，”男孩回答，</td>
		<td class="en">‘Yes, to be sure, I do,’ answered the boy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是，那是你的事，不关我的事。</td>
		<td class="en">‘But it is your affair, not mine.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那么，早上好啊！”他继续前行。</td>
		<td class="en">So good-morning,’ and on he went.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >狼站在原地几分钟，一动不动，它浑身颤抖着，然后悄悄地爬回了它的洞穴。</td>
		<td class="en">The wolf stood still for a few minutes, for he was trembling all over, and then crept quietly back to his cave.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >之后，男孩碰到了狐狸，它那漂亮的银灰色外衣在阳光下闪闪发光。</td>
		<td class="en">Next the boy met the fox, whose lovely coat of silvery grey was shining in the sun.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你看起来气色很不错啊！”男孩停下来赞美它说，“你也是去磨坊主的婚礼吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘You look very fine!’ said the boy, stopping to admire him, ‘are you going to the miller’s wedding too?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，”狐狸回答，“磨坊主为准备这个婚礼花了相当长的时间，然而你知道，磨坊主的朋友是些什么样的人吗——如此迟钝和呆滞。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Yes,’ answered the fox; ‘it is a long journey to take for such a thing as that, but you know what the miller’s friends are like—so dull and heavy!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >过去让他们高兴一下只是出于好心。”</td>
		<td class="en">It is only kind to go and amuse them a little.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你这个可怜的家伙！”男孩怜惜地说，</td>
		<td class="en">‘You poor fellow,’ said the boy pityingly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“听我的忠告，呆在家里吧。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Take my advice and stay at home.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果你一旦进了磨坊主的大门，他的狗就会把你撕成碎片。”</td>
		<td class="en">If you once enter the miller’s gate his dogs will tear you in pieces.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，哎呀，这种事情发生过，我知道。”狐狸神情严肃地回答。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Ah, well, such things have occurred, I know,’ replied the fox gravely.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >没说更多，它就沿着它来时的路跑回去了。</td>
		<td class="en">And without saying any more he trotted off the way he had come.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >它的尾巴刚刚一消失，就听见一阵树枝折断的巨响，一匹马向上跳了过去，它的外皮像绸缎一样闪耀。</td>
		<td class="en">His tail had scarcely disappeared, when a great noise of crashing branches was heard, and up bounded the horse, his black skin glistening like satin.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“早上好，”当它飞奔过去时，它向男孩呼喊道，“现在，我迫不及待要和你说话了。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Good-morning,’ he called to the boy as he galloped past, ‘I can’t wait to talk to you now.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我已经向磨坊主承诺，将出席他的婚宴，直到我去他们才会坐下。”</td>
		<td class="en">I have promised the miller to be present at his wedding-feast, and they won’t sit down till I come.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“停下！停下！”男孩在它后面喊道，他的声音里有一种力量使马停了下来。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Stop! stop!’ cried the boy after him, and there was something in his voice that made the horse pull up.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“怎么了？”它问。</td>
		<td class="en">‘What is the matter?’ asked he.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你知不知道你正在做什么，”男孩说，</td>
		<td class="en">‘You don’t know what you are doing,’ said the boy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你一旦到了那儿，你将永远不可能再在这片树林里飞奔了。</td>
		<td class="en">‘If once you go there you will never gallop through these woods any more.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >你比许多人要强壮得多，但是他们会抓到你，用绳索套住你，你将不得不在你生命中的每一天为他们工作和服务。”</td>
		<td class="en">You are stronger than many men, but they will catch you and put ropes round you, and you will have to work and to serve them all the days of your life.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >听到这些话，马甩甩它的头，冷笑了一下。</td>
		<td class="en">The horse threw back his head at these words, and laughed scornfully.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“对，我要比许多人强壮得多，”它回答，“世界上所有的绳索都不能套住我。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Yes, I am stronger than many men,’ answered he, ‘and all the ropes in the world would not hold me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >让他们以最快的速度绑我好了，我总是能挣脱开来，返回到森林，获得自由。”</td>
		<td class="en">Let them bind me as fast as they will, I can always break loose, and return to the forest and freedom.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >说完这些得意的话，它掸了掸它的长尾巴，以比之前更快的速度，飞驰离开了。</td>
		<td class="en">And with this proud speech he gave a whisk of his long tail, and galloped away faster than before.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，当他到达磨坊主的家时，正如男孩所言，一切都发生了。</td>
		<td class="en">But when he reached the miller’s house everything happened as the boy had said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当它看着客人们，正在想它比他们中的任何一个都要漂亮和强壮得多时，突然，一根绳索抛过来套住了它的头，它被掀倒在地，一个马嚼子被猛插到了它的牙齿间。</td>
		<td class="en">While he was looking at the guests and thinking how much handsomer and stronger he was than any of them, a rope was suddenly flung over his head, and he was thrown down and a bit thrust between his teeth.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那时，尽管它奋力挣扎，它还是被拖进了一个马厩，被关了几天，没有任何食物，直到它的精神崩溃，它的外衣失去了它的光泽。</td>
		<td class="en">Then, in spite of his struggles, he was dragged to a stable, and shut up for several days without any food, till his spirit was broken and his coat had lost its gloss.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >之后，它被拴在一个犁上，对于没有听取男孩的忠告而导致它所丧失的一切，它有大把的时间去回忆。</td>
		<td class="en">After that he was harnessed to a plough, and had plenty of time to remember all he had lost through not listening to the counsel of the boy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当马对男孩的话充耳不闻时，男孩在悠闲地漫步，有时从河边采集些野生草莓，有时从一棵树上采摘些野生樱桃，直到他到达森林中间的一块空地。</td>
		<td class="en">When the horse had turned a deaf ear to his words the boy wandered idly along, sometimes gathering wild strawberries from a bank, and sometimes plucking wild cherries from a tree, till he reached a clearing in the middle of the forest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >穿过这片空地，有一头漂亮的乳白色奶牛，它的脖子上套着一个花环。</td>
		<td class="en">Crossing this open space was a beautiful milk-white cow with a wreath of flowers round her neck.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“早上好。”当奶牛向男孩站着的地方走去时，它高兴地说。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Good-morning,’ she said pleasantly, as she came up to the place where the boy was standing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“早上好，”男孩回应，</td>
		<td class="en">‘Good-morning,’ he returned.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你如此匆忙，要到哪儿去啊？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Where are you going in such a hurry?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“去磨坊主的婚礼；我已经弄得很迟了，因为制作花环花了我好长时间，因此我不能停下来啊！”</td>
		<td class="en">‘To the miller’s wedding; I am rather late already, for the wreath took such a long time to make, so I can’t stop.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不要去，”男孩认真地说，“当他们一旦品尝到你的牛奶，他们就不会让你离开了，你就不得不在你生命中的每一天去为他们服务了。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Don’t go,’ said the boy earnestly;’ when once they have tasted your milk they will never let you leave them, and you will have to serve them all the days of your life.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“噢，胡说；你知道什么？”奶牛回答，它总是认为它自己要比其他人更聪明，</td>
		<td class="en">‘Oh, nonsense; what do you know about it?’ answered the cow, who always thought she was wiser than other people.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“为什么呢？因为我能跑得比他们任何人快两倍！</td>
		<td class="en">‘Why, I can run twice as fast as any of them!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我倒想看看那些设法让我违背我意愿的人。”</td>
		<td class="en">I should like to see anybody try to keep me against my will.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >它甚至没有客气地鞠个躬，就继续走路了，而且感到非常生气。</td>
		<td class="en">And, without even a polite bow, she went on her way, feeling very much offended.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，一切都正如男孩所言。</td>
		<td class="en">But everything turned out just as the boy had said.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这群人已经听说过了奶牛的牛奶的传闻，就劝它给他们一些，于是，它的厄运开始了。</td>
		<td class="en">The company had all heard of the fame of the cow’s milk, and persuaded her to give them some, and then her doom was sealed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一伙人聚集在它的周围，握住它的两个角以便它不能使用它们。像那匹马一样，它被关在牛棚里，只在早上才被放出来。一根长绳系在它的脖子上，绳子的另一端系在一块草坪里的一个木桩上。</td>
		<td class="en">A crowd gathered round her, and held her horns so that she could not use them, and, like the horse, she was shut in the stable, and only let out in the mornings, when a long rope was tied round her head, and she was fastened to a stake in a grassy meadow.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >同样，这也发生在了山羊和绵羊身上。</td>
		<td class="en">And so it happened to the goat and to the sheep.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >最后，驯鹿来了，看起来它和以往一样，好像手边总有一些重要的事情要做。</td>
		<td class="en">Last of all came the reindeer, looking as he always did, as if some serious business was on hand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你去哪里啊？”男孩问，在这个时候，他厌烦了野生樱桃，而正在考虑他的晚餐。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Where are you going?’ asked the boy, who by this time was tired of wild cherries, and was thinking of his dinner.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我被邀请去参加婚礼啊，”驯鹿回答，“磨坊主已经恳求我了，我不能让他失望啊！”</td>
		<td class="en">‘I am invited to the wedding,’ answered the reindeer, ‘and the miller has begged me on no account to fail him.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哎，你傻啊！”男孩喊道，“你完全没有意识到吗？</td>
		<td class="en">‘O fool!’ cried the boy, ‘have you no sense at all?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >你难道不知道，当你到了那儿，他们就会迅速地控制你，因为没有野兽或鸟类会和你一样强壮、敏捷？”</td>
		<td class="en">Don’t you know that when you get there they will hold you fast, for neither beast nor bird is as strong or as swift as you?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这正是我为什么相当安全的原因啊，”驯鹿回应，</td>
		<td class="en">‘That is exactly why I am quite safe,’ replied the reindeer.</td></tr>
