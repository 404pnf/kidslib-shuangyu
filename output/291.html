		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这是个寂静的夏日清晨。太阳早已高高地挂在晴朗的天空上，而田间露珠仍熠熠发光；微风从苏醒不久的山谷拂面而来，带着阵阵香甜，早起的鸟儿在仍然潮湿、静谧的林子里欢快地唱着它们的晨歌。隆起的山岭自上而下被开了花的黑麦覆盖着，从山顶上可以看见一个小村庄。在一条狭窄的乡间小道上，一位头戴圆形草帽、身穿白纱裙的年轻女子正撑着一把阳伞向着这个小村庄走来。在她身后远远地跟着一个侍童。</td>
		<td class="en">IT was a quiet summer morning.The sun stood already pretty high in the clear sky but the fields were still sparkling with dew; a fresh breeze blew fragrantly from the scarce awakened valleys and in the forest, still damp and hushed, the birds were merrily carolling their morning song.On the ridge of a swelling upland, which was covered from base to summit with blossoming rye, a little village was to be seen.Along a narrow by-road to this little village a young woman was walking in a white muslin gown, and a round straw hat, with a parasol in her hand.A page boy followed her some distance behind.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她不慌不忙地走着，好像在享受这漫步的乐趣一般。在她四周，高高的黑麦秆上挂着沉甸甸的麦穗，随着轻风起伏摇摆着；麦浪发出轻柔的沙沙声，时而泛起微微的银绿色，时而泛起一抹浅红色；云雀在头顶欢快的啼鸣着。这位年轻的女人是从自己的家里出来的，她的住处离她现在要去的村庄仅有一英里的距离。她名叫亚历山德拉·巴甫洛芙娜·李比娜。她是个遗孀，没有孩子，但相当富有，和弟弟谢尔盖·巴甫雷奇·沃伦采夫（一名退役的骑兵军官）一起生活。他尚未结婚，帮忙打理姐姐的产业。</td>
		<td class="en">She moved without haste and as though she were enjoying the walk.The high nodding rye all round her moved in long softly rustling waves, taking here a shade of silvery green and there a ripple of red; the larks were trilling overhead.The young woman had come from her own estate, which was not more than a mile from the village to which she was turning her steps.Her name was Alexandra Pavlovna Lipin.She was a widow, childless, and fairly well off, and lived with her brother, a retired cavalry officer, Sergei Pavlitch Volintsev.He was unmarried and looked after her property.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >亚历山德拉·巴甫洛芙娜进了村子，在最后一间又旧又矮的小屋前停了下来，又招呼侍童上前，让他进去探问女主人的健康状况。他很快跟着一个年老体衰、胡子花白的农夫走了出来。</td>
		<td class="en">Alexandra Pavlovna reached the village and, stopping at the last hut, a very old and low one, she called up the boy and told him to go in and ask after the health of its mistress.He quickly came back accompanied by a decrepit old peasant with a white beard.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">‘Of course; yes.’Alexandra Pavlovna went into the hut.It was narrow, stifling, and smoky inside.Some one stirred and began to moan on the stove which formed the bed.Alexandra Pavlovna looked round and discerned in the half darkness the yellow wrinkled face of the old woman tied up in a checked handkerchief.Covered to the very throat with a heavy overcoat she was breathing with difficulty, and her wasted hands were twitching.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">‘There is the girl—her granddaughter, but she always keeps away.She won’t sit with her; she’s such a gad-about.To give the old woman a drink of water is too much trouble for her.And I am old; what use can I be?’</td></tr>

		<td class="en">‘Shouldn’t she be taken to me—to the hospital?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不用了，干吗送去医院？反正也是死。她天命已尽；看来是上帝要带走她了。她都起不了身。还怎么去医院？如果把她弄起来，她会死的。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘No. Why take her to the hospital?She would die just the same.She has lived her life; it’s God’s will now seemingly.She will never get up again.How could she go to the hospital?If they tried to lift her up, she would die.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哎哟！”病妇呻吟着说，“漂亮夫人，千万别丢下我那个可怜的没爹妈的孙女；我家老爷离得远，但是您——”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Oh!’ moaned the sick woman, ‘my pretty lady, don’t abandon my little orphan; our master is far away, but you—’</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“别担心这些。”亚历山德拉·巴甫洛芙娜回复她说，“一切都会为你打理得好好的。瞧，我给你捎来了点茶叶和白糖。如果你想喝就喝点儿吧。你们有茶炊吗？”她看着老头，又说道。没有，不过倒能找来一个。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Do not worry yourself,’ replied Alexandra Pavlovna, ‘everything shall be done.Here is some tea and sugar I have brought you.If you can fancy it you must drink some.Have you a samovar, I wonder?’ she added, looking at the old man.‘A samovar?We haven’t a samovar, but we could get one.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那就找一个来吧，或者我派人给你们送一个过来。叮嘱你孙女一声，让她别这样丢下她祖母了。告诉她，这是可耻的。”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >老妇人抬了下头，向亚历山德拉·巴甫洛芙娜微微靠了靠。</td>
		<td class="en">The old woman raised her head and drew herself a little towards Alexandra Pavlovna.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“把您的小手给我，我亲爱的夫人。”她喃喃地说道。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“现在要留意着她，”她出去的时候对老头说，“要按照药方给她吃药，一顿也别落下，再给她喝点茶。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Take care, now,’ she said to the old man as she went out, ‘and give her the medicine without fail, as it is written down, and give her some tea to drink.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >老头还是没作声，只是给她鞠了个躬。</td>
		<td class="en">Again the old man made no reply, but only bowed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >出来以后，亚历山德拉·巴甫洛芙娜呼吸顺畅多了。她撑起阳伞，正要回家，这时一个男人驾着一辆低矮的双轮轻便马车突然从屋角后面驶了出来。他大约三十岁左右，穿着件破旧的灰色麻布大衣，头戴一顶同样布料的便帽。一看到亚历山德拉·巴甫洛芙娜，他立刻勒住了马，向她转过身来。他那宽阔但没有血色的脸庞，加上他那浅灰色的小眼睛和发白的小胡子都跟他衣服的色调一致。</td>
		<td class="en">Alexandra Pavlovna breathed more freely when she came out into the fresh air.She put up her parasol and was about to start homewards, when suddenly there appeared round the corner of a little hut a man about thirty, driving a low racing droshky and wearing an old overcoat of grey linen, and a foraging cap of the same.Catching sight of Alexandra Pavlovna he at once stopped his horse and turned round towards her.His broad and colourless face with its small light grey eyes and almost white moustache seemed all in the same tone of colour as his clothes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“早上好！”他露出了懒散的微笑，说道，“请问，您在这儿干吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Good-morning!’ he began, with a lazy smile; ‘what are you doing here, if I may ask?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我来看望一个病人……那么您是打哪儿来，米哈伊洛·米哈伊雷奇？”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“看望病人，”他说，“是件好事，不过把她送到医院去会不会更好些呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘You do well,’ he said, ‘to visit the sick, but wouldn’t it be better for you to take her into the hospital?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“她太虚弱了，根本不能动她。”“那么您是不是准备让您的医院歇业了？”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，您现在和拉松斯卡娅夫人交情不浅，看起来受了她的影响。用她的话说，兴建医院啊，学校啊等等这些事情纯属浪费时间，毫无用处。慈善应该是个人的事，教育也是，这些都是事关灵魂的工作……我想她是这么说的。我很想知道，她的这些想法从何而来？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Oh, you are always with Madame Lasunsky now, you know, and seem to be under her influence.And in her words—hospitals, schools, and all that sort of things, are mere waste of time—useless fads.Philanthropy ought to be entirely personal, and education too, all that is the soul’s work... that’s how she expresses herself, I believe.From whom did she pick up that opinion I should like to know?’</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >亚历山德拉·巴甫洛夫娜默默地转身沿路往家走去。她低头走着。远处一阵马蹄声传来，她止住步伐，抬起头来……她弟弟骑着马接她来了；他旁边还站着一个年轻人，那人中等身材，敞着单薄的大衣，系着条轻便的领带，戴着顶浅灰色帽子，手执一根藤条。虽然他看见亚历山德拉·巴甫洛芙娜沉浸在思绪中，目无旁视，但他还是早早地就对她微笑着。她刚停下脚步，他就走上前去，用愉快而又充满感情地大声说道：</td>

		<td class="en">This Pigasov was a strange person.Full of acerbity against everything and every one—especially against women—he was railing from morning to night, sometimes very aptly, sometimes rather stupidly, but always with gusto.His ill-humour almost approached puerility; his laugh, the sound of his voice, his whole being seemed steeped in venom.Darya Mihailovna gave Pigasov a cordial reception; he amused her with his sallies.They were certainly absurd enough.He took delight in perpetual exaggeration.For example, if he were told of any disaster, that a village had been struck by lightning, or that a mill had been carried away by floods, or that a peasant had cut his hand with an axe, he invariably asked with concentrated bitterness, ‘And what’s her name?’ meaning, what is the name of the woman responsible for this calamity, for according to his convictions, a woman was the cause of every misfortune, if you only looked deep enough into the matter.He once threw himself on his knees before a lady he hardly knew at all, who had been effusive in her hospitality to him and began tearfully, but with wrath written on his face, to entreat her to have compassion on him, saying that he had done her no harm and never would come to see her for the future.Once a horse had bolted with one of Darya Mihailovna’s maids, thrown her into a ditch and almost killed her.From that time Pigasov never spoke of that horse except as the ‘good, good horse,’ and he even came to regard the hill and the ditch as specially picturesque spots.Pigasov had failed in life and had adopted this whimsical craze.He came of poor parents.His father had filled various petty posts, and could scarcely read and write, and did not trouble himself about his son’s education; he fed and clothed him and nothing more.His mother spoiled him, but she died early.Pigasov educated himself, sent himself to the district school and then to the gymnasium, taught himself French, German, and even Latin, and, leaving the gymnasiums with an excellent certificate, went to Dorpat, where he maintained a perpetual struggle with poverty, but succeeded in completing his three years’ course.Pigasov’s abilities did not rise above the level of mediocrity; patience and perseverance were his strong points, but the most powerful sentiment in him was ambition, the desire to get into good society, not to be inferior to others in spite of fortune.He had studied diligently and gone to the Dorpat University from ambition.Poverty exasperated him, and made him watchful and cunning.He expressed himself with originality; from his youth he had adopted a special kind of stinging and exasperated eloquence.His ideas did not rise above the common level; but his way of speaking made him seem not only a clever, but even a very clever, man.Having taken his degree as candidate, Pigasov decided to devote himself to the scholastic profession; he understood that in any other career he could not possibly be the equal of his associates.He tried to select them from a higher rank and knew how to gain their good graces; even by flattery, though he was always abusing them.But to do this he had not, to speak plainly, enough raw material.Having educated himself through no love for study, Pigasov knew very little thoroughly.He broke down miserably in the public disputation, while another student who had shared the same room with him, and who was constantly the subject of his ridicule, a man of very limited ability who had received a careful and solid education, gained a complete triumph.Pigasov was infuriated by this failure, he threw all his books and manuscripts into the fire and went into a government office.At first he did not get on badly, he made a fair official, not very active, extremely self-confident and bold, however; but he wanted to make his way more quickly, he made a false step, got into trouble, and was obliged to retire from the service.He spent three years on the property he had bought himself and suddenly married a wealthy half-educated woman who was captivated by his unceremonious and sarcastic manners.But Pigasov’s character had become so soured and irritable that family life was unendurable to him.After living with him a few years, his wife went off secretly to Moscow and sold her estate to an enterprising speculator; Pigasov had only just finished building a house on it.Utterly crushed by this last blow, Pigasov began a lawsuit with his wife, but gained nothing by it.After this he lived in solitude, and went to see his neighbours, whom he abused behind their backs and even to their faces, and who welcomed him with a kind of constrained half-laugh, though he did not inspire them with any serious dread.He never took a book in his hand.He had about a hundred serfs; his peasants were not badly off.</td></tr>
