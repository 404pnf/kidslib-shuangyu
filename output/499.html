		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >作者：安德鲁·朗格</td>
		<td class="en">by Andrew Lang</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >迪克·惠廷顿的父母去世的时候，他还很小；事实上，他太小了，根本就不认得他们，也不认得他的出生地。</td>
		<td class="en">Dick Whittington was a very little boy when his father and mother died; so little, indeed, that he never knew them, nor the place where he was born.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他像一匹小马驹那样，衣衫褴褛地在乡下游荡，后来他遇到一位要前往伦敦的车夫。车夫准许他在马车旁跟着走，不收他引路的费用。</td>
		<td class="en">He strolled about the country as ragged as a colt, till he met with a wagoner who was going to London, and who gave him leave to walk all the way by the side of his wagon without paying anything for his passage.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这使小惠廷顿非常高兴，他太想去伦敦看看了，因为他听说那儿的街道上铺满了黄金，而且他想拿走一蒲式耳；可当他看到街道上布满泥土而不是黄金，发现自己身处陌生之地，没有朋友、没有食物、没有钱的时候，他是多么失望啊，可怜的孩子！</td>
		<td class="en">This pleased little Whittington very much, as he wanted to see London sadly, for he had heard that the streets were paved with gold, and he was willing to get a bushel of it; but how great was his disappointment, poor boy! when he saw the streets covered with dirt instead of gold, and found himself in a strange place, without a friend, without food, and without money.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管车夫很慷慨，让他免费跟在马车一旁，但赶到市内的时候，车夫还是谨慎地装作不认识他。很快，可怜的男孩又冷又饿，他希望自己能呆在乡下一间上好的厨房，依偎在温暖的火炉旁。</td>
		<td class="en">Though the wagoner was so charitable as to let him walk up by the side of the wagon for nothing, he took care not to know him when he came to town, and the poor boy was, in a little time, so cold and hungry that he wished himself in a good kitchen and by a warm fire in the country.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在困境中，他央求过好几个人帮他，其中有人吩咐他“去给无所事事的小流氓干活。”</td>
		<td class="en">In his distress he asked charity of several people, and one of them bid him “Go to work for an idle rogue.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我会的，”惠廷顿说，“我会全心全意地去做；如果你愿意，我会为你干活的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“That I will,” said Whittington, “with all my heart; I will work for you if you will let me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个人认为这句话里含有捉弄和挑衅的意味（尽管这个可怜的小伙子只是想表示他准备好干活而已），就用棍子打了他，把他的头都打破了，鲜血直流。</td>
		<td class="en">The man, who thought this savored of wit and impertinence (though the poor lad intended only to show his readiness to work), gave him a blow with a stick which broke his head so that the blood ran down.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在这种情况下，他饿晕了，便在商人菲茨沃伦的门前躺了下来。这时厨师看到了他，那个脾气暴躁的粗野女人便命令他去干自己的活儿，不然她就拿开水烫死他。</td>
		<td class="en">In this situation, and fainting for want of food, he laid himself down at the door of one Mr. Fitzwarren, a merchant, where the cook saw him, and, being an ill-natured hussy, ordered him to go about his business or she would scald him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这时，菲茨沃伦先生从交易所回来了，他也开始责骂这可怜的男孩，命令他快回去干活。</td>
		<td class="en">At this time Mr. Fitzwarren came from the Exchange, and began also to scold at the poor boy, bidding him to go to work.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >惠廷顿回答说，要是有人愿意雇用他，他会很乐意去干活的，还说如果他能吃点儿东西，就能干活了，因为三天以来，他没有吃过一点儿东西，他还说自己是个可怜的乡下男孩，谁都不认识，也没人愿意雇用他。</td>
		<td class="en">Whittington answered that he should be glad to work if anybody would employ him, and that he should be able if he could get some victuals to eat, for he had had nothing for three days, and he was a poor country boy, and knew nobody, and nobody would employ him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后他想站起来，但他太虚弱了，还是倒了下去。这让商人心中对他燃起无限的同情，他命令仆人把男孩带进屋，给他肉和喝的，还让他帮助厨师去做她吩咐的所有脏活。</td>
		<td class="en">He then endeavored to get up, but he was so very weak that he fell down again, which excited so much compassion in the merchant that he ordered the servants to take him in and give him some meat and drink, and let him help the cook to do any dirty work that she had to set him about.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人们十分喜欢责备那些无所事事又有求于人的人，但却不为他们考虑一下，好让他们有点儿正经事可做，或是考虑考虑他们是否适合做这件事——这可算不上是慈善。</td>
		<td class="en">People are too apt to reproach those who beg with being idle, but give themselves no concern to put them in the way of getting business to do, or considering whether they are able to do it, which is not charity.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但我们还是回到惠廷顿身上来吧，如果没有这位总是难为他的坏脾气厨师，他本可以快乐地生活在这户富裕的家庭里。那厨师一直忙着烤肉、涂佐料，烤肉叉一闲着，她就把它伸向可怜的惠廷顿！</td>
		<td class="en">But we return to Whittington, who could have lived happy in this worthy family had he not been bumped about by the cross cook, who must be always roasting and basting, or when the spit was idle employed her hands upon poor Whittington!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >最后，男孩主人的女儿艾丽斯小姐知道了这一切，对这可怜的男孩心生同情，命令仆人们善待他。</td>
		<td class="en">At last Miss Alice, his master’s daughter, was informed of it, and then she took compassion on the poor boy, and made the servants treat him kindly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >除了厨师的坏脾气，惠廷顿要想高兴，还要解决另一个难题。</td>
		<td class="en">Besides the crossness of the cook, Whittington had another difficulty to get over before he could be happy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >主人的命令他在阁楼上的一张毛屑垫小床上休息，但那里有许多老鼠。它们常常爬过这可怜男孩的鼻子，打扰他休息。</td>
		<td class="en">He had, by order of his master, a flock-bed placed for him in a garret, where there was a number of rats and mice that often ran over the poor boy’s nose and disturbed him in his sleep.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，过了一段时间，一位绅士来到他主人的住处。因为惠廷顿给这位绅士擦了鞋，这位绅士给了惠廷顿一便士。</td>
		<td class="en">After some time, however, a gentleman who came to his master’s house gave Whittington a penny for brushing his shoes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他下定决心要好好利用这一便士，便把它放到自己的口袋里；第二天，他看到街上有位女士胳膊下夹着一只猫，就跑上前去询问猫的价格。</td>
		<td class="en">This he put into his pocket, being determined to lay it out to the best advantage; and the next day, seeing a woman in the street with a cat under her arm, he ran up to know the price of it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那位女士（因为那只猫很会逮老鼠）要了很高的价钱，但惠廷顿告诉她他自己除了一便士外，在世上一无所有，而且他特别想要一只猫，于是女士就把猫卖给了他。</td>
		<td class="en">The woman (as the cat was a good mouser) asked a deal of money for it, but on Whittington’s telling her he had but a penny in the world, and that he wanted a cat sadly, she let him have it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >惠廷顿害怕他的死敌，也就是厨师，会打那只猫，就把猫藏在阁楼上，猫很快就把老鼠们咬死或吓跑了，就这样，可怜的男孩现在可以尽情酣睡了。</td>
		<td class="en">This cat Whittington concealed in the garret, for fear she should be beat about by his mortal enemy the cook, and here she soon killed or frightened away the rats and mice, so that the poor boy could now sleep as sound as a top.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不久之后，这位商人有只船要出海，他像往常那样，把仆人叫来，让他们每人往船上运一件货物去卖，碰碰自己的运气；不管运送什么，他们既不用付运费，也不用付关税，因为商人理所当然地认为，他越乐意让穷人分享他的财产，全能的上帝就越会保佑他。</td>
		<td class="en">Soon after this the merchant, who had a ship ready to sail, called for his servants, as his custom was, in order that each of them might venture something to try their luck; and whatever they sent was to pay neither freight nor custom, for he thought justly that God Almighty would bless him the more for his readiness to let the poor partake of his fortune.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >所有仆人都来了，除了可怜的惠廷顿。他既没钱又没货物，想不出运什么东西来碰碰自己的运气；但他的好朋友艾丽斯小姐知道，因为贫穷，他来不了，就派人去叫他。</td>
		<td class="en">All the servants appeared but poor Whittington, who, having neither money nor goods, could not think of sending anything to try his luck; but his good friend Miss Alice, thinking his poverty kept him away, ordered him to be called.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后她想给他点儿什么东西，但商人告诉他女儿说不行，运的必须是他自己的东西。</td>
		<td class="en">She then offered to lay down something for him, but the merchant told his daughter that would not do, it must be something of his own.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对此，可怜的惠廷顿说他除了一只猫，什么都没有。那只猫还是靠别人给他的一便士买来的。</td>
		<td class="en">Upon which poor Whittington said he had nothing but a cat which he bought for a penny that was given him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“孩子，把猫拿来吧，”商人说道，“把她送上船。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Fetch thy cat, boy,” said the merchant, “and send her.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >惠廷顿把可怜的猫咪带来，递给了船长。他眼睛里含着泪水，因为他说现在自己肯定会像之前那样被老鼠打搅了。</td>
		<td class="en">Whittington brought poor puss and delivered her to the captain, with tears in his eyes, for he said he should now be disturbed by the rats and mice as much as ever.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >所有同伴都嘲笑这笔交易，只有艾丽斯小姐很同情这可怜的男孩，还给了他点儿钱，好再买一只猫。</td>
		<td class="en">All the company laughed at the adventure but Miss Alice, who pitied the poor boy, and gave him something to buy another cat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >猫咪在大海上与风浪搏斗，而可怜的惠廷顿却在家里被粗暴的女厨子毒打。女厨子很严酷地使唤他，还为他把自己的猫送上船而嘲弄他。最后，可怜的男孩决定逃离这个地方。他把自己的仅有一点儿东西打包好之后，就在万圣节那天的清晨出发了。</td>
		<td class="en">While puss was beating the billows at sea, poor Whittington was severely beaten at home by his tyrannical mistress the cook, who used him so cruelly, and made such game of him for sending his cat to sea, that at last the poor boy determined to run away from his place, and having packed up the few things he had, he set out very early in the morning on All-Hallows day.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他走了很久，到了霍洛韦，在那里他坐在一块石头上，思索着接下来应该走哪条道；但他还在沉思的时候，仅有的六口鲍教堂洪钟开始敲响了；他觉得钟声在用这种方式对他说：</td>
		<td class="en">He traveled as far as Holloway, and there sat down on a stone to consider what course he should take; but while he was thus ruminating, Bow bells, of which there were only six, began to ring; and he thought their sounds addressed him in this manner:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“回去吧，惠廷顿，</td>
		<td class="en">“Turn again, Whittington,</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >三任市长，管伦敦。”</td>
		<td class="en">Thrice Lord Mayor of London.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“伦敦市长！”他自言自语道，“成为伦敦市市长，可以乘那么豪华的马车，为了当伦敦市市长，一个人还有什么是不可以忍受的呢？</td>
		<td class="en">“Lord Mayor of London!” said he to himself, “what would not one endure to be Lord Mayor of London, and ride in such a fine coach?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >好吧，我会回去的，忍受西塞莉所有的拳打脚踢和使唤，但不能放过成为市长大人的机会！”</td>
		<td class="en">Well, I’ll go back again, and bear all the pummelling and ill-usage of Cicely rather than miss the opportunity of being Lord Mayor!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >所以他回到了家，快快乐乐地进入屋子里开始干活，直到西塞莉出现。</td>
		<td class="en">So home he went, and happily got into the house and about his business before Mrs. Cicely made her appearance.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们现在必须跟着猫咪小姐来到非洲海岸线上了。</td>
		<td class="en">We must now follow Miss Puss to the coast of Africa.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >海上航行是多么危险，狂风巨浪是多么难以预测，海上的生活又会遇上多少意外啊！</td>
		<td class="en">How perilous are voyages at sea, how uncertain the winds and the waves, and how many accidents attend a naval life!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >猫所在的那只船在海上受尽颠簸。最终，船被逆向的风吹到巴巴里海岸上，那里住着不为英国人所知的摩尔人。</td>
		<td class="en">The ship that had the cat on board was long beaten at sea, and at last, by contrary winds, driven on a part of the coast of Barbary which was inhabited by Moors unknown to the English.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这些摩尔人很友善地接待了我们的同胞。为了同他们做生意，船长向他们展示了船上货物的样品，还送了一些给这个国家的国王。国王十分高兴，便派人请船长和代理商到他的宫殿里来，宫殿离大海约有一英里远。</td>
		<td class="en">These people received our countrymen with civility, and therefore the captain, in order to trade with them, showed them the patterns of the goods he had on board, and sent some of them to the King of the country, who was so well pleased that he sent for the captain and the factor to come to his palace, which was about a mile from the sea.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >根据国习俗，他们被安排坐在用金银织成花样的地毯上；国王和王后则坐在房间的最里面。正餐端了上来，有许多道菜。但菜一放下，数量惊人的老鼠就从四面窜来，顷刻之间就把所有肉食都吃得精光。</td>
		<td class="en">Here they were placed, according to the custom of the country, on rich carpets, flowered with gold and silver; and the King and Queen being seated at the upper end of the room, dinner was brought in, which consisted of many dishes; but no sooner were the dishes put down but an amazing number of rats and mice came from all quarters and devoured all the meat in an instant.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >代理商十分吃惊，他转身询问贵族们，这些寄生虫有没有冒犯到他们。</td>
		<td class="en">The factor, in surprise, turned round to the nobles and asked if these vermin were not offensive.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“唉！</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >是啊，”他们说道，“它们实在讨厌；国王愿意贡献出一半的财产来除掉它们，因为就像你看到的，它们不仅把他的饭菜毁了，还在他的卧室，甚至是床上袭击他，所以他在睡觉时只能命人在一旁看着，因为他很怕那些老鼠。”</td>
		<td class="en">yes,” said they, “very offensive; and the King would give half his treasure to be freed of them, for they not only destroy his dinner, as you see, but they assault him in his chamber, and even in bed, so that he is obliged to be watched while he is sleeping, for fear of them.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >代理商高兴地跳了起来；因为他想起了可怜的惠廷顿和他的猫，他告诉国王自己在船上有一只小动物，可以立即驱散这群寄生虫。</td>
		<td class="en">The factor jumped for joy; he remembered poor Whittington and his cat, and told the King he had a creature on board the ship that would despatch all these vermin immediately.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个消息让国王喜出望外，他高兴得心像是飞了起来，连头巾都从头上掉了下来。</td>
		<td class="en">The King’s heart heaved so high at the joy which this news gave him that his turban dropped off his head.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“把这小动物带来，”他说道，“这群寄生虫可恶至极，如果她真像你说的那么能干，我就用一整船的金银珠宝船来换她。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Bring this creature to me,” said he; “vermin are dreadful in a court, and if she will perform what you say I will load your ship with gold and jewels in exchange for her.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >代理商很懂得做生意，便抓住这次机会好好利用猫咪小姐的长处。</td>
		<td class="en">The factor, who knew his business, took this opportunity to set forth the merits of Miss Puss.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他告诉国王，失去她会造成不便，因为如果没了她，耗子们就可能把船上的货物都糟蹋完了——但为了给国王帮忙，他会把她带来的。</td>
		<td class="en">He told his Majesty that it would be inconvenient to part with her, as, when she was gone, the rats and mice might destroy the goods in the ship—but to oblige his Majesty he would fetch her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“跑着去，跑着去，”女王说道，“我迫不及待地想看看这可爱的小动物了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Run, run,” said the Queen; “I am impatient to see the dear creature.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >代理商飞奔而去，同时另一顿美餐被端了上来。代理商带着猫回来的时候，耗子们跟刚刚一样，正在抢吃抢喝。</td>
		<td class="en">Away flew the factor, while another dinner was providing, and returned with the cat just as the rats and mice were devouring that also.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他立刻把猫咪小姐放下来，她咬死了许多耗子。</td>
		<td class="en">He immediately put down Miss Puss, who killed a great number of them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >看到自己的宿敌被这么一只小动物杀死了，国王万分欣喜，王后也十分高兴，便想让人把猫抱近些看看。</td>
		<td class="en">The King rejoiced greatly to see his old enemies destroyed by so small a creature, and the Queen was highly pleased, and desired the cat might be brought near that she might look at her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是，代理商叫道“猫咪，猫咪，猫咪！”她就来到他跟前。</td>
		<td class="en">Upon which the factor called “Pussy, pussy, pussy!” and she came to him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后他就把她拿给王后看。王后往后退了退，因为这小东西竟给老鼠们造成了那么大的破坏，她可不敢碰她；但是，因为代理商一边抚摸着猫，一边说着“猫咪，猫咪！”王后也就碰了她一下，嘴里叫着“猫腻，猫腻！”因为她从没学过英语。</td>
		<td class="en">He then presented her to the Queen, who started back, and was afraid to touch a creature who had made such havoc among the rats and mice; however, when the factor stroked the cat and called “Pussy, pussy!” the Queen also touched her and cried “Putty, putty!” for she had not learned English.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后他把她放到王后的膝盖上，猫咪一边咕噜咕噜叫着，一边玩着王后的手，然后唱着自己的歌睡着了。</td>
		<td class="en">He then put her down on the Queen’s lap, where she, purring, played with her Majesty’s hand, and then sang herself to sleep.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >国王看到了猫咪小姐的功绩，又得知她生的小猫可以遍及全国，便跟船长和代理商做交易，要买下一整船的货物，然后他给了他们相当于这些货物十倍的金钱来换取这只猫。</td>
		<td class="en">The King, having seen the exploits of Miss Puss, and being informed that her kittens would stock the whole country, bargained with the captain and factor for the whole ship’s cargo, and then gave them ten times as much for the cat as all the rest amounted to.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >装着这些东西，他们辞别了国王和宫殿里其他大人物，在和风的吹拂下驶向英国。现在我们必须讲讲这里的人发生的故事了。</td>
		<td class="en">On which, taking leave of their Majesties and other great personages at court, they sailed with a fair wind for England, whither we must now attend them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >早晨，天刚刚放亮，菲茨沃伦先生就起床，去清点账目，张罗当天的生意了。</td>
		<td class="en">The morn had scarcely dawned when Mr. Fitzwarren arose to count over the cash and settle the business for that day.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他刚刚进了账房，才在桌前坐下，就有人前来，笃笃敲着门。</td>
		<td class="en">He had just entered the counting-house, and seated himself at the desk, when somebody came, tap, tap, at the door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是谁啊？”菲茨沃伦先生问。</td>
		<td class="en">“Who’s there?” said Mr. Fitzwarren.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">“I come to bring you good news of your ship Unicorn.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >商人匆忙站起身来，连自己有痛风病都忘了；他立即打开门，看到等在那里的正是船长和代理商，他们带着一箱珠宝和一张提货单。看到这些，商人抬起头，感谢上天恩赐，让这次航程收获颇丰。</td>
		<td class="en">The merchant bustled up in such a hurry that he forgot his gout; instantly opened the door, and who should be seen waiting but the captain and factor, with a cabinet of jewels, and a bill of lading, for which the merchant lifted up his eyes and thanked heaven for sending him such a prosperous voyage.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后他们向他讲述了那只猫的故事，还给他看那箱珠宝，那是他们为惠廷顿先生带来的。</td>
		<td class="en">Then they told him the adventures of the cat, and showed him the cabinet of jewels which they had brought for Mr. Whittington.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对此他十分急切地叫了出来，但并不是以最像诗歌的方式：</td>

		<td class="en">It is not our business to animadvert upon these lines; we are not critics, but historians.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对我们来说，知道那是菲茨沃伦先生说的话就足够了；尽管我们的目的不是要证明他是位好诗人，或者我们没本事这么做，但我们还是会很快让读者相信，他是个好人，是个很好的角色；因为在场有人告诉他，他赏赐的财产对惠廷顿这样一个穷小子来说太多了的时候，他说：“上帝不允许我从他身上夺走哪怕一便士；那是他自己的，每个子儿都该归他所有。”</td>
		<td class="en">It is sufficient for us that they are the words of Mr. Fitzwarren; and though it is beside our purpose, and perhaps not in our power to prove him a good poet, we shall soon convince the reader that he was a good man, which was a much better character; for when some who were present told him that this treasure was too much for such a poor boy as Whittington, he said: “God forbid that I should deprive him of a penny; it is his own, and he shall have it to a farthing.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后他命令惠廷顿先生进来，这时，惠廷顿还在清理厨房，他还找借口不进账房，说账房已经清扫干净了，而他的鞋又脏，又钉满了平头钉。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而商人让他进来，还叫人给他拿来了一把椅子。</td>
		<td class="en">The merchant, however, made him come in, and ordered a chair to be set for him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >惠廷顿看到这一切，还以为他们想捉弄他，因为他在厨房经常被捉弄，便恳求主人不要戏弄一个可怜又卑微的小伙子了，他不想伤害任何人，还是让他去做自己的事吧。</td>
		<td class="en">Upon which, thinking they intended to make sport of him, as had been too often the case in the kitchen, he besought his master not to mock a poor simple fellow, who intended them no harm, but let him go about his business.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >商人握着他的手，说：“惠廷顿先生，事实上我对你是真诚相待，我叫你来是想祝贺你的巨大成功。</td>
		<td class="en">The merchant, taking him by the hand, said: “Indeed, Mr. Whittington, I am in earnest with you, and sent for you to congratulate you on your great success.</td></tr>
