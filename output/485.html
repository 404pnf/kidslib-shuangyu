		<td class="en">The genial Justice of the Peace—now, alas, no more—who made himself responsible for the facts of this story, used to begin in the good old-fashioned way with a bright moonlight night and a mysterious figure, an excellent stroke for an opening, even to this day, if well followed up.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >圣诞的月亮（他会这么说）正冷冰冰地面向高地，高地反射出的闪闪寒光如此细微，只有附近的一只眼睛才能辨别得清。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这眼睛，他说，是一个年轻牧羊人的眼睛，对这一行来说，他真的是太年轻了。他站在一个带轮子的小棚子里，通过小棚子的孔洞，茫然地看着外面的景色。在产羔季节早期，牧羊人基本上都用这种小棚子。</td>
		<td class="en">This eye, he said, was the eye of a shepherd lad, young for his occupation, who stood within a wheeled hut of the kind commonly in use among sheep-keepers during the early lambing season, and was abstractedly looking through the loophole at the scene without.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个地方叫做产羔角，人们在这片区域盖起棚子。这里是马尔伯里丘陵地这块无边无际、高低起伏的牧场的一部分。沿着从伦敦出发、穿过威塞克斯中部的主干道，穿过阿尔德布里坎，朝着巴斯和布里斯托尔的方向前行，便会横贯马尔伯里丘陵地。</td>
		<td class="en">The spot was called Lambing Corner, and it was a sheltered portion of that wide expanse of rough pastureland known as the Marlbury Downs, which you directly traverse when following the turnpike-road across Mid-Wessex from London, through Aldbrickham, in the direction of Bath and Bristol.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">In the rear, the shelter afforded by the belt of furze bushes was artificially improved by an inclosure of upright stakes, interwoven with boughs of the same prickly vegetation, and within the inclosure lay a renowned Marlbury-Down breeding flock of eight hundred ewes.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那是一个德鲁伊教巨石牌坊，由三块长方形的石头构成了一个门的形状：两块竖着，一块横着作门楣。</td>
		<td class="en">It was a Druidical trilithon, consisting of three oblong stones in the form of a doorway, two on end, and one across as a lintel.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >每块石头都有许多磨痕、划痕和裂痕以及冲刷等逐渐受损的痕迹，此外，它们也经历了成千上万种天气地侵袭。但是现在，这几块大石头看起来外形优美，一点儿都不显得破旧不堪，银色的月光照在上面，它们显得十分漂亮。</td>
		<td class="en">Each stone had been worn, scratched, washed, nibbled, split, and otherwise attacked by ten thousand different weathers; but now the blocks looked shapely and little the worse for wear, so beautifully were they silvered over by the light of the moon.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当地人把这处遗迹称为“魔鬼门”。</td>
		<td class="en">The ruin was locally called the Devil’s Door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不一会儿，一位老牧羊人从羊群的方向走过来，进了棚子，在阴暗中环顾四周。</td>
		<td class="en">An old shepherd presently entered the hut from the direction of the ewes, and looked around in the gloom.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你困了吗？”他用一种生气的语调问年轻牧羊人。</td>

		<td class="en">The lad replied rather timidly in the negative.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那么，”老牧羊人说，“我就回家去了，回去休息几个小时。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我看这里也没什么事了。</td>
		<td class="en">There’s nothing to be done here now as I can see.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >天亮前，羊群不需要照顾，它们根本不需要照顾。</td>
		<td class="en">The ewes can want no more tending till daybreak—’tis beyond the bounds of reason that they can.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是既然要求我们中有一个留在这里，那我就回去了，你听到了吧。</td>
		<td class="en">But as the order is that one of us must bide, I’ll leave ’ee, d’ye hear.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >你白天可以睡觉，可我不行。</td>

		<td class="en">And you can be down to my house in ten minutes if anything should happen.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我可给你买不起蜡烛；但是，现在是圣诞节，人们都在过节，你可以放松一下，在椅子上睡一会儿，不用一直醒着。</td>
		<td class="en">I can’t afford ’ee candle; but, as ’tis Christmas week, and the time that folks have hollerdays, you can enjoy yerself by falling asleep a bit in the chair instead of biding awake all the time.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是记住：你睡着的时间不要超过‘魔鬼门’的阴影移动几拃宽的时间，因为你必须看好母羊。”</td>
		<td class="en">But mind, not longer at once than while the shade of the Devil’s Door moves a couple of spans, for you must keep an eye upon the ewes.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >男孩没有给出明确回答，老牧羊人用手杖拨了拨炉子里的火，为他的伙伴关上门，然后消失在了夜幕中。</td>
		<td class="en">The boy made no definite reply, and the old man, stirring the fire in the stove with his crook-stem, closed the door upon his companion and vanished.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >自产羔季来临以来，这基本上成了每晚的习惯做法。要他负责看管羊群，男孩一点儿都不觉得意外，有时候他就用炉子里的火点燃稻草来自娱自乐。</td>
		<td class="en">As this had been more or less the course of events every night since the season’s lambing had set in, the boy was not at all surprised at the charge, and amused himself for some time by lighting straws at the stove.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后，他出去看看母羊和新生的小羊羔，再回来坐下，直到最后睡着。</td>
		<td class="en">He then went out to the ewes and new-born lambs, re-entered, sat down, and finally fell asleep.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这是他守夜时的习惯做法，尽管这周他得到特别许可，在夜里可以打几个盹，其实，之前每个晚上他都已经这么做了，每次都睡着，直到凌晨三四点老牧羊人用手杖敲打他的肩膀时才醒来。</td>
		<td class="en">This was his customary manner of performing his watch, for though special permission for naps had this week been accorded, he had, as a matter of fact, done the same thing on every preceding night, sleeping often till awakened by a smack on the shoulder at three or four in the morning from the crook-stem of the old man.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他这次醒来时，大概已是十一点了。</td>
		<td class="en">It might have been about eleven o’clock when he awoke.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他很意外，很明显没人叫他或敲他，他竟然自己醒了。但再一想，他觉得肯定有人已经叫过他，虽然没看着人，他通过棚子的窗子向羊群望去。</td>
		<td class="en">He was so surprised at awaking without, apparently, being called or struck, that on second thoughts he assumed that somebody must have called him in spite of appearances, and looked out of the hut window towards the sheep.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >跟之前他去看的时候一样，它们都静静地卧着，几乎听不到咩咩叫的声音，也没有任何人出现打破这一安静的场面。</td>
		<td class="en">They all lay as quiet as when he had visited them, very little bleating being audible, and no human soul disturbing the scene.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接着，他从对面的窗口向外看去，这边的景象则大不相同。</td>
		<td class="en">He next looked from the opposite window, and here the case was different.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >和以往一样，地上的霜层在月光下晶莹发亮；一个荆豆丛在同样的地方间或投下一个黑影，幽灵般的巨石牌坊立在最显眼的地方。</td>
		<td class="en">The frost-facets glistened under the moon as before; an occasional furze bush showed as a dark spot on the same; and in the foreground stood the ghostly form of the trilithon.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，巨石牌坊前站着一个男子。</td>
		<td class="en">But in front of the trilithon stood a man.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >稍加观察就会发现他明显不是老牧羊人，也不是农场工人。他身着深色外套，身形高瘦，举止优雅。</td>
		<td class="en">That he was not the shepherd or any one of the farm labourers was apparent in a moment’s observation,—his dress being a dark suit, and his figure of slender build and graceful carriage.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他在巨石牌坊前来回踱步。</td>
		<td class="en">He walked backwards and forwards in front of the trilithon.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >年轻牧羊人正在思索这个时间怎么会出现一个陌生男子，突然看见另外一个人影正穿过开阔的草地，朝着巨石牌坊和挡着棚子的荆豆丛走来。</td>
		<td class="en">The shepherd lad had hardly done speculating on the strangeness of the unknown’s presence here at such an hour, when he saw a second figure crossing the open sward towards the locality of the trilithon and furze-clump that screened the hut.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二位人物是一位女性；一看到她，陌生男子便急忙上前，恰好就在棚子窗户前与她会面。</td>
		<td class="en">This second personage was a woman; and immediately on sight of her the male stranger hastened forward, meeting her just in front of the hut window.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她好像还没反应过来，他便已经紧紧抱住了她。</td>
		<td class="en">Before she seemed to be aware of his intention he clasped her in his arms.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你来了，哈丽雅特，老天会保佑你的！”他激动地叫道。</td>
		<td class="en">‘You have come, Harriet—bless you for it!’ he exclaimed, fervently.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“得了吧。”她回答道，语气中带着恼怒。</td>
		<td class="en">‘But not for this,’ she answered, in offended accents.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后，她用缓和一点儿的语气说道：“弗雷德，是因为你求我，我才来的！</td>
		<td class="en">And then, more good-naturedly, ‘I have come, Fred, because you entreated me so!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >你写这样一封信的目的是什么？</td>
