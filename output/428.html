		<td class="en">When he walked with long strides along the garden walk of his little country parsonage, he would sometimes ask himself the question: “Why has God done this?” And he would dwell on this continually, putting himself in the place of God, and he almost invariably found an answer.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“女人啊，我跟你有什么关系呢？”他经常重复耶稣的这句话，还说，“看来上帝本人对自己所创作的这个作品也不满意。”女人是引诱第一个男人误入歧途的罪人，并且从那以后一直不断地重复着这该死的勾当；女人是脆弱的、危险的、神秘而魅惑的生物。他厌恶她们那罪恶的躯体，更憎恶她们那颗多情的心。</td>
		<td class="en">He often repeated the words of Christ: “Woman, what have I to do with thee?” and he would add: “It seems as though God, Himself, were dissatisfied with this work of His.” She was the tempter who led the first man astray, and who since then had ever been busy with her work of damnation, the feeble creature, dangerous and mysteriously affecting one. And even more than their sinful bodies, he hated their loving hearts.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >依照他的信仰看来，上帝创造女人的唯一目的是为了勾引并考验男人。他认为，一个男人在接近女人时必须要小心谨慎、加以防范，并对可能会出现的陷阱有畏惧之心。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他只有对修女才会宽容一些，因为她们立下誓言，承诺她们以后不会害人了；但他依然对她们很严格，因为他能感觉到，在她们那被束缚的、谦逊的内心里，那股永恒的柔情一直在激情地燃烧着——这柔情甚至向他——一个神父——流露出来。</td>
		<td class="en">He had no indulgence except for nuns, whom their vows had rendered inoffensive; but he was stern with them, nevertheless, because he felt that at the bottom of their fettered and humble hearts the everlasting tenderness was burning brightly—that tenderness which was shown even to him, a priest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >甚至当他和她们说话时，从她们温顺低沉的语调里，从她们低垂的眼睛里；当他严厉训斥她们时，从她们委屈的泪水里，他都感觉到了这该死的温柔。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当他快走出女修道院的门口时，他会抖一抖他的教士服，然后加大步伐，快速离开，仿佛要逃离什么危险似的。</td>

		<td class="en">She was a pretty, brainless madcap.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当神父在传教布道时，她就会大笑；当他对她发脾气时，她就给他一个拥抱，把他搂在心口，然而他会不知不觉地将自己从这个充满甜蜜快感的拥抱中挣脱出来。这个拥抱唤醒了沉睡在他内心深处的、每个男人与生俱来的父爱感。</td>
		<td class="en">When the abbe preached she laughed, and when he was angry with her she would give him a hug, drawing him to her heart, while he sought unconsciously to release himself from this embrace which nevertheless filled him with a sweet pleasure, awakening in his depths the sensation of paternity which slumbers in every man.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当他和她并肩走在乡间小路上时，他常常会跟她讲述上帝，他的上帝。但她从没有认真地听他讲过，而是四下张望，看看天空，看看花草树木，眼里闪烁着对生活的喜悦。</td>
		<td class="en">Often, when walking by her side, along the country road, he would speak to her of God, of his God. She never listened to him, but looked about her at the sky, the grass and flowers, and one could see the joy of life sparkling in her eyes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >有时她会扑上前抓一些飞虫，然后尖叫着跑回来：“看，舅舅，多么漂亮啊！我想抱抱它！”</td>
		<td class="en">Sometimes she would dart forward to catch some flying creature, crying out as she brought it back: “Look, uncle, how pretty it is! I want to hug it!” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然而，这种想“抱抱”飞虫或紫丁香花的愿望却让神父感到很生气，焦躁不安。即使在这里，神父还是看到了在女人内心里含苞待放且无法根除的柔情。</td>
		<td class="en">And this desire to “hug” flies or lilac blossoms disquieted, angered, and roused the priest, who saw, even in this, the ineradicable tenderness that is always budding in women’s hearts.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后有一天，为神父看管房子的一个教堂司事的妻子小心翼翼地告诉他，说他的外甥女有一个情人。</td>
		<td class="en">Then there came a day when the sexton’s wife, who kept house for Abbe Marignan, told him, with caution, that his niece had a lover.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >听到这个消息后，心里产生的恐惧感几乎令他窒息。他一动不动地站在那里，满脸肥皂泡，因为他正在刮胡子。</td>
		<td class="en">Almost suffocated by the fearful emotion this news roused in him, he stood there, his face covered with soap, for he was in the act of shaving.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当他完全恢复过来，能思考能说话时，他喊道：“梅拉妮，这不是真的，你在说谎！”</td>
		<td class="en">When he had sufficiently recovered to think and speak he cried: “It is not true; you lie, Melanie!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但这个农妇把手放在胸口，说：“神父先生，如果我说谎，就让上帝惩罚我！</td>
		<td class="en">But the peasant woman put her hand on her heart, saying: “May our Lord judge me if I lie, Monsieur le Cure!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我跟您说，每天晚上您姐姐睡后，她就会去那儿。他们总是在河畔约会，大约在十点到半夜之间，您去看看就知道了。”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他停止了刮胡子，急躁地在房间里来回走动——当他陷入沉思时他总会这样。</td>
		<td class="en">He ceased scraping his chin, and began to walk up and down impetuously, as he always did when he was in deep thought.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当他再次刮胡子时，从鼻子到耳朵，他连着刮破了三次。</td>
		<td class="en">When he began shaving again he cut himself three times from his nose to his ear.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >整整一天他都怀着满心的愤怒和羞辱，沉默不语。</td>
		<td class="en">All day long he was silent, full of anger and indignation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >作为神父，他本来就厌恶这种不可征服的情爱。更让他怒不可遏的是，作为她的精神教父、监护人和牧师，他竟然被一个孩子欺骗和玩弄了。这种自我的情绪，也就是做父母在听到女儿宣布，在他们不知情也不同意的情况下找了一个丈夫时所表现出来的。</td>
		<td class="en">To his priestly hatred of this invincible love was added the exasperation of her spiritual father, of her guardian and pastor, deceived and tricked by a child, and the selfish emotion shown by parents when their daughter announces that she has chosen a husband without them, and in spite of them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >晚饭后，他试着读一会儿书，但他读不下去，越想越生气。</td>
		<td class="en">After dinner he tried to read a little, but could not, growing more and, more angry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >十点的时候，他拿起自己的手杖，这是一根结实的橡木棍。通常在夜间看望病人时，他会带着它。</td>
		<td class="en">When ten o’clock struck he seized his cane, a formidable oak stick, which he was accustomed to carry in his nocturnal walks when visiting the sick.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后他望着这根巨大的棍棒笑了笑，用他乡下人的强壮的拳头，快速地轮转着它，甚是逼人。</td>
		<td class="en">And he smiled at the enormous club which he twirled in a threatening manner in his strong, country fist.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >然后他突然把它举起来，牙齿咬得格格响，向一把椅子砸去，顿时椅背断裂，倒在地上。</td>
		<td class="en">Then he raised it suddenly and, gritting his teeth, brought it down on a chair, the broken back of which fell over on the floor.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他打开门准备出去。但在门口停住了脚步，他惊讶于眼前皎洁的月光，这样的月光他几乎不曾见过。</td>
		<td class="en">He opened the door to go out, but stopped on the sill, surprised by the splendid moonlight, of such brilliance as is seldom seen.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >由于他天生比较情绪化，正如那些充满诗意的梦想家和教父一样。淡淡的夜色充满了高贵和宁静的美，他突然被这美妙的夜晚分了心，心中泛起一阵感动。</td>
		<td class="en">And, as he was gifted with an emotional nature, one such as had all those poetic dreamers, the Fathers of the Church, he felt suddenly distracted and moved by all the grand and serene beauty of this pale night.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在他的小花园里，一切都沐浴在柔和的月光里。他的那些果树，排列成行，纤细枝条的倩影投映在小径上，树上的叶子还没长满。巨大的金银花藤顺着他房子的墙壁爬行，散发着香甜醉人的气息，花朵的芬芳溢满了温暖的月色下的每一个角落。</td>
		<td class="en">In his little garden, all bathed in soft light, his fruit trees in a row cast on the ground the shadow of their slender branches, scarcely in full leaf, while the giant honeysuckle, clinging to the wall of his house, exhaled a delicious sweetness, filling the warm moonlit atmosphere with a kind of perfumed soul.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">He began to take long breaths, drinking in the air as drunkards drink wine, and he walked along slowly, delighted, marveling, almost forgetting his niece.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一走出花园，他就停下来，凝神注视着整个平原，它淹没在轻柔的月光里，沐浴着静夜的温柔与爱意。</td>
		<td class="en">As soon as he was outside of the garden, he stopped to gaze upon the plain all flooded with the caressing light, bathed in that tender, languishing charm of serene nights.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这时，传来了蟋蟀短促的、金属般的鸣声。远处夜莺舒展歌喉，啁啾啼啭，它们那轻快活泼的歌声让人摒弃思考，宛若置身梦境，在这迷人的月光下，为亲吻伴奏。</td>
		<td class="en">At each moment was heard the short, metallic note of the cricket, and distant nightingales shook out their scattered notes—their light, vibrant music that sets one dreaming, without thinking, a music made for kisses, for the seduction of moonlight.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >神父重新朝前走去，他自己也不知道为什么心软下来了。</td>
		<td class="en">The abbe walked on again, his heart failing, though he knew not why.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >突然，他感到精疲力竭，有些虚弱。他想在那里坐下来，休息一会儿，去思考和欣赏上帝创造的作品。</td>
		<td class="en">He seemed weakened, suddenly exhausted; he wanted to sit down, to rest there, to think, to admire God in His works.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >远处，沿着波光粼粼的小河，蜿蜒着一长排的白杨树。一层白色的薄雾浮在山的上方，月光穿透过去，照亮了它，使它银光闪闪，好像把整个曲曲折折的河道笼罩在一种轻盈、透明的棉花里。</td>
		<td class="en">Down yonder, following the undulations of the little river, a great line of poplars wound in and out. A fine mist, a white haze through which the moonbeams passed, silvering it and making it gleam, hung around and above the mountains, covering all the tortuous course of the water with a kind of light and transparent cotton.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >神父再一次停下来，心里涌起了一阵越来越强烈的、不可抗拒的温柔。</td>
		<td class="en">The priest stopped once again, his soul filled with a growing and irresistible tenderness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >随后一种模模糊糊的、说不清的躁动感袭上心头。他想起了自己经常问自己的那个问题：</td>
		<td class="en">And a doubt, a vague feeling of disquiet came over him; he was asking one of those questions that he sometimes put to himself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“上帝为什么要这么做呢？</td>
		<td class="en">“Why did God make this?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >既然黑夜的存在是为了使人忘记一切，让人平静下来，让人安眠，那么为什么上帝要让它比白昼更迷人，比黎明和傍晚更温柔呢？</td>
		<td class="en">Since the night is destined for sleep, unconsciousness, repose, forgetfulness of everything, why make it more charming than day, softer than dawn or evening?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个充满魅力的星球，比太阳更加富有诗情画意，它是那么小心谨慎，似乎是专门为照亮那些对于白昼来说太微妙也太神秘的万物而准备的，为什么它将黑夜变得如此透明呢？”</td>
