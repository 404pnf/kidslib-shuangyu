		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >歇洛克·福尔摩斯从壁炉台的角落拿起一只药瓶，又把一支皮下注射器从整洁的山羊皮匣子里拿了出来。接着，他用修长白皙的手指小心翼翼地装好细细的针头，然后就把左边的衬衫袖口挽了起来。有那么一小会儿，他只是若有所思地看着自己强健有力的前臂和手腕，上面已经布满了数不清的针眼。到最后，他把针头扎了进去，又把针筒一推到底，跟着就再次倒进那把天鹅绒面的扶手椅，心满意足地长出了一口气。</td>
		<td class="en">Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantel-piece, and his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case. With his long, white, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle and rolled back his left shirt cuff. For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist, all dotted and scarred with innumerable puncture marks. Finally, he thrust the point home, pressed down the tiny piston, and sank back into the velvetlined armchair with a long sigh of satisfaction.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >好几个月以来，同样的表演我每天都要看三次。不过，看得多并不意味着看得惯。恰恰相反，我对这种场景的反感日益加深，每天晚上都会受到良心的谴责，责备自己缺乏抗议的勇气。我一次又一次地发誓要清除这个良心上的包袱，可是，我室友那种冷漠淡然的架势让人万万不敢在他面前有丝毫放肆。他非凡的本领，高高在上的态度，还有我业已有所领教的一些特异性情，全都让我畏葸退缩，不敢去冒犯他。不过，就在这天下午，或者是因为我午餐时和他一起喝了点儿博讷葡萄酒[^2]，又或是因为他那副慢条斯理、不厌其烦的样子让人格外烦躁，我突然觉得，再装看不见已经不行了。</td>
		<td class="en">Three times a day for many months I had witnessed this performance, but custom had not reconciled my mind to it. On the contrary, from day to day I had become more irritable at the sight, and my conscience swelled nightly within me at the thought that I had lacked the courage to protest. Again and again I had registered a vow that I should deliver my soul upon the subject; but there was that in the cool, nonchalant air of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would care to take anything approaching to a liberty. His great powers, his masterly manner, and the experience which I had had of many extraordinary qualities, all made me diffident and backward in crossing him. Yet upon that afternoon, whether it was the Beaune which I had taken with my lunch or the additional exasperation produced by the extreme deliberation of his manner, I suddenly felt that I could bold out no longer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“今天又是什么呢，”我问道，“是吗啡，还是可卡因？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Which is it today,” I asked, “morphine or cocaine?” </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他刚刚翻开一本古旧的书籍，此时便无精打采地抬了抬眼皮。</td>
		<td class="en">He raised his eyes languidly from the old black-letter volume which he had opened.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是可卡因[^2]，”他说道，“百分之七的溶液。你想试试吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“It is cocaine,” he said, “a seven-percent solution. Would you care to try it?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不想，绝对不想，”我粗鲁地答道。“我的身体还没从阿富汗战争当中恢复过来呢，我可不想再让它承受什么新的伤害。”</td>
		<td class="en">“No, indeed,” I answered brusquely. “My constitution has not got over the Afghan campaign yet. I cannot afford to throw any extra strain upon it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >看到我激烈的反应，他笑了一笑。“也许你说得对，华生，”他说道。“按我看，从生理上说，它的确是有害的。不过，我发现它特别地提神醒脑，跟这个比起来，副作用也就是小事一桩了。”</td>
		<td class="en">He smiled at my vehemence. “Perhaps you are right, Watson,” he said. “I suppose that its influence is physically a bad one. I find it, however, so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind that its secondary action is a matter of small moment.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可你得想想！”我恳切地说道。“想想其中的代价！它也许的确有你说的那种效力，可以让你的脑子兴奋起来，可是，这个过程是病态的，会加快身体组织的变化，往最轻的方面说也会造成永久性的身体虚弱。它把你弄得多么沮丧，你自己应该也很清楚。毫无疑问，这是件得不偿失的事情。它带来的快感不过是一瞬间，却可能会让你失去那些天生的非凡禀赋，你干吗要冒这样的险呢？你一定得记住，我说这话可不光因为咱是朋友，还因为我是一名医生，对你的健康负有一定的责任。”</td>
		<td class="en">“But consider!” I said earnestly. “Count the cost! Your brain may, as you say, be roused and excited, but it is a pathological and morbid process which involves increased tissue-change and may at least leave a permanent weakness. You know, too, what a black reaction comes upon you. Surely the game is hardly worth the candle. Why should you, for a mere passing pleasure, risk the loss of those great powers with which you have been endowed? Remember that I speak not only as one comrade to another but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he is to some extent answerable.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他好像并没有生气的意思，恰恰相反，他把双手的指尖拢到一起，还把双肘支在了椅子的扶手上，一副谈兴很高的样子。</td>
		<td class="en">He did not seem offended. On the contrary, he put his finger-tips together, and leaned his elbows on the arms of his chair, like one who has a relish for conversation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我的脑子，”他说道，“受不了死水一潭的局面。给我个问题，给我件工作，只管把最深奥难解的密码或是最错综复杂的分析扔到我面前，我马上就会进入最佳的状态。那样的话，我就可以放弃这些人造的兴奋剂。可是，我真的是对按部就班的单调生活深恶痛绝，非常渴望精神上的强烈刺激。就是由于这个原因，我才选择了这份特殊的职业，准确说的话，是创造了这份特殊的职业，因为这世上干这行的只有我一个。”</td>
		<td class="en">“My mind,” he said, “rebels at stagnation. Give me problems , give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram, or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation. That is why I have chosen my own particular profession, or rather created it, for I am the only one in the world.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“私家侦探只有你一个？”我扬起了眉毛。</td>
		<td class="en">“The only unofficial detective?” I said, raising my eyebrows.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“私家顾问侦探只有我一个，”他回答道。“我是侦探行当之中最后也最高的上诉法庭。格雷森啦，雷斯垂德啦，埃瑟尼·琼斯啦，这些人一旦山穷水尽——当然，山穷水尽是他们的正常状态——就会把案子摆到我的面前。作为行业之中的专家，我会检查相关的材料，向他们提供专业的意见。我从不为这些案子邀功请赏，我的名字也不会出现在任何一张报纸上。工作本身就已经是最高的奖赏，因为我为自己的特殊本领找到了一块用武之地。当然喽，我那些工作方法，你应该已经通过杰弗逊·霍普一案有了一点儿切身体会吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The only unofficial consulting detective,” he answered. “I am the last and highest court of appeal in detection. When Gregson, or Lestrade, or Athelney Jones are out of their depths—which, by the way, is their normal state—the matter is laid before me. I examine the data, as an expert, and pronounce a specialist’s opinion. I claim no credit in such cases. My name figures in no newspaper. The work itself, the pleasure of finding a field for my peculiar powers, is my highest reward. But you have yourself had some experience of my methods of work in the Jefferson Hope case.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没错，深有体会，”我诚心诚意地说道。“这辈子我还没见过比它更惊人的事呢。甚至啊，我还把它写成了一本小册子，又起了个稀奇古怪的书名，叫做‘暗红习作’。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Yes, indeed,” said I cordially. “I was never so struck by anything in my life. I even embodied it in a small brochure, with the somewhat fantastic title of ‘A Study in Scarlet.’ ”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他悲哀地摇了摇头。</td>
		<td class="en">He shook his head sadly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我大概扫了一眼你写的东西，”他说道。“说实在话，我没法向你表示祝贺。侦探工作是，或者说应该是，一门精密的科学，因此就应该像其他精密科学一样，得到不带感情色彩的冷静对待。可你却试图给它加上一点儿浪漫色彩，最后的效果呢，就跟把爱情故事或者私奔情节塞到欧几里得第五命题[^3]当中差不多。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I glanced over it,” said he. “Honestly, I cannot congratulate you upon it. Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner. You have attempted to tinge it with romanticism, which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an elopement into the fifth-proposition of Euclid.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可是，案子里面的确有浪漫的情节啊，”我抗议道。“我总不能篡改事实吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“But the romance was there,” I remonstrated. “I could not tamper with the facts.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“有些事实没必要写出来，非要写的话，也得把握好剪裁的分寸。这件案子里只有一点值得一提，也就是那种抽丝剥茧、以果推因的奇妙演绎方法，全靠了它的帮助，我才能够成功破案。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Some facts should be suppressed, or, at least, a just sense of proportion should be observed in treating them. The only point in the case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes, by which I succeeded in unravelling it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我心里觉得很是恼火，因为我写这本东西完全是为了讨他的好，得到的却是他的数落。与此同时，我必须承认，他那种自以为是的态度也是我生气的原因。他似乎是认为，我这本小册子应该专门记述他个人的所作所为，只字不提任何别的东西。跟他一起在贝克街生活的这些年里，我不止一次地注意到，这位室友好为人师的沉静外表下面藏着一点小小的虚荣。不过，这会儿我并没有说什么，只是坐在那里揉自己的伤腿。我这条腿曾经吃过一颗捷泽尔枪弹[^4]，虽然不妨碍走路，天气变化的时候却总会疼痛难忍。</td>
		<td class="en">I was annoyed at this criticism of a work which had been specially designed to please him. I confess, too, that I was irritated by the egotism which seemed to demand that every line of my pamphlet should be devoted to his own special doings. More than once during the years that I had lived with him in Baker Street I had observed that a small vanity underlay my companion’s quiet and didactic manner. I made no remark, however, but sat nursing my wounded leg. I had had a Jezail bullet through it some time before, and though it did not prevent me from walking it ached wearily at every change of the weather.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“最近，我的业务已经扩展到了欧洲大陆，”一会儿之后，福尔摩斯一边往他那个古旧的欧石南[^5]烟斗里装烟丝，一边开口说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“My practice has extended recently to the Continent,” said Holmes after a while, filling up his old brier-root pipe. </td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“上个星期，弗朗索瓦·勒·维拉尔来咨询过我，你没准儿也听说过，这个人近来在法国的侦探界很出风头。他完全继承了凯尔特人[^6]那种敏锐的直觉，要在侦探领域更进一步却还缺少一个必备的条件，那就是广博而精确的知识。他那件案子牵扯到一份遗嘱，有几个地方也还满有意思。后来我让他去参考两件类似的案子，一件发生在一八五七年的里加，另一件则发生在一八七一年的圣路易斯[^7]。这么着，他就找到了正确的答案。你瞧瞧，这是我今天早上收到的感谢信。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I was consulted last week by François le Villard, who, as you probably know, has come rather to the front lately in the French detective service. He has all the Celtic power of quick intuition, but he is deficient in the wide range of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments of his art. The case was concerned with a will and possessed some features of interest. I was able to refer him to two parallel cases, the one at Riga in 1857, and the other at St. Louis in 1871, which have suggested to him the true solution. Here is the letter which I had this morning acknowledging my assistance.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >说话间，他把一张皱巴巴的外国纸片扔了过来。我飞快地扫了一遍，瞥见了一大堆赞美之辞，处处都是“精彩绝伦”、“大师手笔”和“高招妙着”之类的字眼，充分体现了那位法国侦探五体投地的景仰之情。</td>
		<td class="en">He tossed over, as he spoke, a crumpled sheet of foreign notepaper. I glanced my eyes down it, catching a profusion of notes of admiration, with stray *magnifiques*, *coup-de-mâitres* and *tours-de-force*, all testifying to the ardent admiration of the Frenchman.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他这完全是学生对老师说话的口气嘛，”我说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“He speaks as a pupil to his master,” said I.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，他把我的帮助看得太重要了，”歇洛克·福尔摩斯轻声说了一句。“其实呢，他自己也是很有天赋的。理想的侦探需要三个条件，他已经具备了两个。观察能力和演绎能力他都有，缺的只是知识，而知识也是他迟早会有的东西。眼下，他正在把我的一些拙文译成法文。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, he rates my assistance too highly,” said Sherlock Holmes slightly. “He has considerable gifts himself. He possesses two out of the three qualities necessary for the ideal detective. He has the power of observation and that of deduction. He is only wanting in knowledge, and that may come in time. He is now translating my small works into French.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你的文章？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Your works?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“喔，你还不知道吗？”他笑了起来，高声说道。“不怕献丑，我的确写过几篇论文，讲的都是技术方面的问题。比如说，你瞧，这篇就是《论各种烟灰之间的区别》。我在文章里列举了一百四十种雪茄、香烟和烟丝，还用了彩图来说明各种烟灰有何不同。烟灰是侦破罪案时经常都会碰到的东西，有时候还会成为极其重要的线索。举个例子来说吧，如果你能确定某个凶手抽的是印度细条雪茄，显然就可以缩小搜索的范围。对于一双训练有素的眼睛来说，崔克诺帕里雪茄的黑灰和鸟眼烟丝的白末截然不同，区别就跟白菜和土豆一样明显。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, didn’t you know?” he cried, laughing. “Yes, I have been guilty of several monographs. They are all upon technical subjects. Here, for example, is one ‘Upon the Distinction between the Ashes of the Various Tobaccos.’ In it I enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar, cigarette, and pipe tobacco, with coloured plates illustrating the difference in the ash. It is a point which is continually turning up in criminal trials, and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a clue. If you can say definitely, for example, that some murder had been done by a man who was smoking an Indian *lunkah*, it obviously narrows your field of search. To the trained eye there is as much difference between the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white fluff of bird’s-eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你辨识细节的本事真是不一般，”我如是评论。</td>
		<td class="en">“You have an extraordinary genius for minutiae,” I remarked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那是因为我认识到了细节的重要性。喏，这篇讲的是如何辨认足迹，还附上了用石膏提取足印的方法。还有这篇，这是一篇有趣的小文章，讲的是职业如何影响人的手形，随附的石版画上画的是石工、水手、木塞制作工、排字工、织工和钻石琢磨工的手。注重科学的侦探都会发现，这东西非常实用，尤其有助于辨认无名尸体和查明罪犯履历。不过，我光顾着唠叨我的这些爱好，你一定觉得很无趣吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I appreciate their importance. Here is my monograph upon the tracing of footsteps, with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of Paris as a preserver of impresses. Here, too, is a curious little work upon the influence of a trade upon the form of the hand, with lithotypes of the hands of slaters, sailors, cork-cutters, compositors, weavers, and diamond-polishers. That is a matter of great practical interest to the scientific detective—especially in cases of unclaimed bodies, or in discovering the antecedents of criminals. But I weary you with my hobby.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一点儿也不，”我恳切地说道。“我觉得这些事情再有趣不过了，尤其是在我有幸看到你的实际应用以后。还有，你刚才提到了观察和演绎，我没想错的话，这两样东西在一定程度上应该是一回事吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Not at all,” I answered earnestly. “It is of the greatest interest to me, especially since I have had the opportunity of observing your practical application of it. But you spoke just now of observation and deduction. Surely the one to some extent implies the other.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不对，完全不是一回事，”他一边回答，一边舒舒服服地靠回椅子背上，抽了几口烟斗，吐出一个个浓浓的蓝色烟圈。“举例来说，观察只能让我知道你今天早上去过威格默尔街邮局，演绎却让我知道你在那里发了封电报。 ”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why, hardly,” he answered, leaning back luxuriously in his armchair and sending up thick blue wreaths from his pipe. “For example, observation shows me that you have been to the Wigmore Street Post Office this morning, but deduction lets me know that when there you dispatched a telegram.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“一点儿不错！”我说道。“两件事你都说对了！可是说老实话，我真想不出来你是怎么知道的。我去那里只是突发奇想，事先又没跟别人提过。 ”</td>
		<td class="en">“Right!” said I. “Right on both points! But I confess that I don’t see how you arrived at it. It was a sudden impulse upon my part, and I have mentioned it to no one.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这事情就是简单的代名词，”看到我的诧异，他吃吃地笑了一阵——“简单到了荒唐的地步，解释未免有点儿多余。话说回来，它兴许可以说明观察和演绎之间的界限。观察告诉我，你鞋帮上有一个小小的红色泥点。威格默尔街邮局对面的人行道正在施工，下面的土被翻到了街上，去邮局的人很难不踩到上面。那里的土带有一种特殊的红色，据我所知在这周围的其他地方是找不出的。观察的结果就是这么多，其他的都是演绎了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It is simplicity itself,” he remarked, chuckling at my surprise—“so absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous; and yet it may serve to define the limits of observation and of deduction. Observation tells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to your instep. Just opposite the Wigmore Street Office they have taken up the pavement and thrown up some earth, which lies in such a way that it is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering. The earth is of this peculiar reddish tint which is found, as far as I know, nowhere else in the neighbourhood. So much is observation. The rest is deduction.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那么，电报的事情你是怎么演绎出来的呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“How, then, did you deduce the telegram?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，我整个早上都坐在你对面，当然知道你没有写过信。你书桌的抽屉开着，我看到里面有一整版没撕开的邮票和厚厚的一沓明信片。如此说来，你去邮局不是发电报又是干什么呢？排除掉所有不可能的情形之后，剩下的就必然是事情的真相。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why, of course I knew that you had not written a letter, since I sat opposite to you all morning. I see also in your open desk there that you have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of postcards. What could you go into the post-office for, then, but to send a wire? Eliminate all other factors, and the one which remains must be the truth.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“就这件事情来说，你说得当然没错，”我想了一想才开口回答。“不过，你刚才也说了，这是件最最简单的事情。要是我出一道更难的题目来检验你的理论，你不会觉得我不讲道理吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“In this case it certainly is so,” I replied after a little thought. “The thing however, is, as you say, of the simplest. Would you think me impertinent if I were to put your theories to a more severe test?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“恰恰相反，”他回答道，“要是这样的话，我就用不着再打一针可卡因了。不管你要出什么样的题目，我都非常乐意尝试。”</td>
		<td class="en">“On the contrary,” he answered, “it would prevent me from taking a second dose of cocaine. I should be delighted to look into any problem which you might submit to me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我听你说过，如果一个人每天都要使用某件物品，那就难免会在物品上留下深深的个人印记，这样一来，有经验的观察者就可以从中窥见他的个性。好了，我这儿有一只刚到手没多久的表。你能不能行行好，把上一个主人的性格或者习惯告诉我呢？”</td>
		<td class="en">“I have heard you say it is difficult for a man to have any object in daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it in such a way that a trained observer might read it. Now, I have here a watch which has recently come into my possession. Would you have the kindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the late owner?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我把表递给了他，心里带着一点儿小小的得意，因为按我看，我这个题目根本解不了，目的只是想让他吸取教训，不要再时不时地拿出一种自以为是的腔调。他把表摊在手上，紧紧地盯着表盘看了一阵，然后又打开底盖，检查了一下里面的机簧，先是用眼睛看，后来又用上了一把高倍的放大镜。最后他终于“啪”的一声合上表盖，把表还给了我。看到他那张沮丧不已的脸，我忍不住微笑起来。</td>
		<td class="en">I handed him over the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in my heart, for the test was, as I thought, an impossible one, and I intended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he occasionally assumed. He balanced the watch in his hand, gazed hard at the dial, opened the back, and examined the works, first with his naked eyes and then with a powerful convex lens. I could hardly keep from smiling at his crestfallen face when he finally snapped the case to and handed it back.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这只表几乎提供不了任何资料，”他说道。“有人刚刚清洗过这只表，最能说明问题的那些痕迹都被洗掉了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There are hardly any data,” he remarked. “The watch has been recently cleaned, which robs me of my most suggestive facts.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你说得对， ”我答道。“到我手里之前，这只表的确刚刚洗过。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You are right,” I answered. “It was cleaned before being sent to me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我嘴上这么说，心里却很是不以为然，觉得我室友不该拿这么苍白无力的借口来掩盖自己的失败。就算表没洗过，他又能看到些什么资料呢？</td>
		<td class="en">In my heart I accused my companion of putting forward a most lame and impotent excuse to cover his failure. What data could he expect from an uncleaned watch?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我这次研究虽然不能让人满意，却也不是一无所获，”他抬头盯着天花板，眼神又空洞又暗淡。“不对的话请你指正，我认为这只表本来是你哥哥的，而他又是从你父亲那里继承来的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Though unsatisfactory, my research has not been entirely barren,” he observed, staring up at the ceiling with dreamy, lack-lustre eyes. “Subject to your correction, I should judge that the watch belonged to your elder brother, who inherited it from your father.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“毫无疑问，这你是从刻在底盖上的‘H. W.’知道的吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“That you gather, no doubt, from the H. W. upon the back?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“的确如此。 ‘W’代表你的姓氏[^8]，而这只表是将近五十年之前制造的，刻在表上的姓名缩写又跟表一样古老，说明它是为你们家的上一代制造的。家里的珠宝通常都会传给长子，长子又多半会袭用父亲的姓名。如果我没记错的话，你父亲已经过世多年，这样一来，表自然会传到你哥哥手里。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Quite so. The W. suggests your own name. The date of the watch is nearly fifty years back, and the initials are as old as the watch: so it was made for the last generation. Jewellery usually descends to the eldest son, and he is most likely to have the same name as the father. Your father has, if I remember right, been dead many years. It has, therefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“到现在为止都没说错，”我说道。“还有什么别的吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Right, so far,” said I. “Anything else?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“他是个不爱整洁的人，应该说是非常不爱整洁，而且非常不小心。你家里本来为他预备了光明的前程，可他却浪费了自己的机会。他过了一段很穷的日子，偶尔也会有短暂的宽裕，最后他死了，死的时候已经沾上了酒瘾。我能看出来的只有这些，别的就没了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“He was a man of untidy habits—very untidy and careless. He was left with good prospects, but he threw away his chances, lived for some time in poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity, and finally, taking to drink, he died. That is all I can gather.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我从椅子上蹦了起来，拖着伤腿在房间里乱走，想快又快不起来，心里充满了苦涩的感觉。</td>
		<td class="en">I sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room with considerable bitterness in my heart.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你这样可就太掉价了，福尔摩斯，”我说道。“我真是不敢相信，你竟然能堕落到这种地步。你去查过我那个不幸兄长的历史，现在又装模作样地在我面前推断出来。你可别指望我相信，这些都是你从他这只旧表里看出来的！你这么干不光是不厚道，坦白说的话，还有点儿江湖骗子的意思。”</td>
		<td class="en">“This is unworthy of you, Holmes,” I said. “I could not have believed that you would have descended to this. You have made inquiries into the history of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way. You cannot expect me to believe that you have read all this from his old watch! It is unkind and, to speak plainly, has a touch of charlatanism in it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“亲爱的医生，”他好声好气地说道，“请接受我的歉意。刚才我只是把这事情当作一个抽象的题目，忘了它对你来说是一件多么真切、多么伤心的事情。不过，我可以向你保证，在你把表拿给我看之前，我连你有个哥哥都不知道呢。”</td>
		<td class="en">“My dear doctor,” said he kindly, “pray accept my apologies. Viewing the matter as an abstract problem, I had forgotten how personal and painful a thing it might be to you.

When you observe the lower part of that watch-case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places but it is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard objects, such as coins or keys, in the same pocket.

On reaching London I drove to the Langham and was informed that Captain Morstan was staying there, but that he had gone out the night before and had not returned. I waited all day without news of him. That night, on the advice of the manager of the hotel, I communicated with the police, and next morning we advertised in all the papers.

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一直到下午五点半钟，福尔摩斯才回到了贝克街。只见他兴高采烈、精神抖擞，以他的情形而论，这样的状态总是与最为消沉的阵发性抑郁交替出现的。</td>
		<td class="en">It was half past five before Holmes returned. He was bright, eager, and in excellent spirits, a mood which in his case alternated with fits of the blackest depression.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这件案子并没有什么特别神秘的地方，”他一边说，一边端起了我倒给他的那杯茶，“所有的事实综合起来，可能的解释似乎只有一个。”</td>
		<td class="en">“There is no great mystery in this matter,” he said, taking the cup of tea which I had poured out for him; “the facts appear to admit of only one explanation.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“什么！这件案子你已经解决了吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“What! you have solved it already?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“呃，这么说倒也为时尚早。我只是发现了一个富于启发性的事实，如此而已。这个事实，话又说回来，启发性非常之大。当然喽，细节还有待补充。刚才我查阅了以前的《泰晤士报》，结果发现，家住诺伍德高地、曾在孟买第三十四步兵团服役的舒尔托少校已经死亡，时间是一八八二年四月二十八日。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, that would be too much to say. I have discovered a suggestive fact, that is all. It is, however, very suggestive. The details are still to be added. I have just found, on consulting the back files of the Times, that Major Sholto, of Upper Norwood, late of the Thirty-fourth Bombay Infantry, died upon the twenty-eighth of April, 1882.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“恕我愚笨，福尔摩斯，可我真的没看出来，这个事实的启发性在哪里。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see what this suggests.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“没看出来？你可真让我惊讶。那么，你不妨这样来分析眼前的问题。莫斯坦上尉消失了。在伦敦的时候，他唯一有可能拜访过的人就是舒尔托少校。舒尔托少校却说他不知道莫斯坦上尉在伦敦。四年之后，舒尔托死了。他死之后不到一周，莫斯坦上尉的女儿就收到了一件价值不菲的礼物。礼物年年都有，如今还衍生出了一封信，信里说莫斯坦上尉的女儿是个蒙冤受屈的女子。除了夺去她的父亲之外，信里所说的冤屈还能是什么东西呢？如果不是舒尔托的后人知道了一些内情、想要对她进行补偿的话，送礼物的行动为什么会在舒尔托死后立刻开始呢？面对这些事实，你还能提出什么别的解释吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“No? You surprise me. Look at it in this way, then. Captain Morstan disappears. The only person in London whom he could have visited is Major Sholto. Major Sholto denies having heard that he was in London. Four years later Sholto dies. Within a week of his death Captain Morstan’s daughter receives a valuable present, which is repeated from year to year and now culminates in a letter which describes her as a wronged woman. What wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father? And why should the presents begin immediately after Sholto’s death unless it is that Sholto’s heir knows something of the mystery and desires to make compensation? Have you any alternative theory which will meet the facts?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可是，这种补偿可真是古怪！补偿的方法也一样古怪！还有，既然他现在愿意写信，六年前为什么不写呢？此外，信里说什么还她公道，她能得到什么样的公道呢？要说她父亲到现在还活着，那样的假设未免有点儿太过牵强。另一方面，就你所掌握的情况来说，她并没有蒙受什么别的冤屈。”</td>
		<td class="en">“But what a strange compensation! And how strangely made! Why, too, should he write a letter now, rather than six years ago? Again, the letter speaks of giving her justice. What justice can she have? It is too much to suppose that her father is still alive. There is no other injustice in her case that you know of.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这案子还有疑点，疑点确实还有，”歇洛克·福尔摩斯若有所思地说道。</td>
		<td class="en">“There are difficulties; there are certainly difficulties,” said Sherlock Holmes pensively; “but our expedition of tonight will solve them all. Ah, here is a four-wheeler, and Miss Morstan is inside. Are you all ready? Then we had better go down, for it is a little past the hour.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不过，今晚的冒险之旅应该可以澄清所有的疑问。嗬，楼下来了辆四轮马车，莫斯坦小姐也在里面。你准备好了吗？好了的话，咱们最好赶紧下楼，时间已经比咱们约定的晚了一点点。”我拿起了帽子，还有我最沉重的那根手杖，同时也留意到，福尔摩斯把他的左轮手枪从抽屉里拿了出来，又把它塞进了衣服口袋。很显然，他觉得今天晚上的活计不会轻松。</td>
		<td class="en">I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observed that Holmes took his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket. It was clear that he thought that our night’s work might be a serious one.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >莫斯坦小姐裹了一件黑色的斗篷，聪慧的脸庞虽然平静，却也显得有些苍白。面对我们即将展开的这次诡异之旅，她要是不觉得忐忑不安的话，那也就不像个女人了。尽管如此，她还是展现出了无懈可击的自控能力，对歇洛克·福尔摩斯提出的几个附加问题也是应答如响。</td>
		<td class="en">Miss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak, and her sensitive face was composed but pale. She must have been more than woman if she did not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were embarking, yet her self-control was perfect, and she readily answered the few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes put to her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“舒尔托少校和我爸爸是非常亲密的朋友，”她说道。“爸爸的信里老是会提到这位少校。他和爸爸都是安达曼群岛驻军的指挥官，因此就一起经历过许多事情。对了，我们曾经在爸爸的书桌里找到一张奇怪的纸条，谁也不明白其中的意思。我倒不认为它有任何价值，只是觉得您没准儿会想看看它，所以就把它给带来了。喏，就是这个。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Major Sholto was a very particular friend of Papa’s,” she said. “His letters were full of allusions to the major. He and Papa were in command of the troops at the Andaman Islands, so they were thrown a great deal together. By the way, a curious paper was found in Papa’s desk which no one could understand. I don’t suppose that it is of the slightest importance, but I thought you might care to see it, so I brought it with me. It is here.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >福尔摩斯小心翼翼地打开纸条，又把它放在自己的膝盖上展平，然后才拿出自己的双层放大镜，有条不紊地把整张纸仔仔细细地检查了一遍。</td>
		<td class="en">Holmes unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his knee. He then very methodically examined it all over with his double lens.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这张纸是印度的土产，”他说道。“曾经被人钉在一块板子上。纸上的图形似乎是一座巨型建筑的局部构造，那座建筑里有数不清的厅堂、走廊和过道。图上有个地方用红墨水标着一个小小的十字，十字的上方有一行褪色的铅笔字迹，写的是‘左起3.37’。左边的角落里有一个古怪的符号，看着像是连成一横排的四个十字，符号的旁边用非常粗糙的字体写着，‘四签名——乔纳森·斯莫、穆罕默德 ·辛格、阿卜杜拉 ·汗、多斯特·阿克巴’。我承认，我也看不出它跟这个案子有什么关联。不过，它显然是一份非常重要的文件。它当初是被人小心翼翼收在钱夹里的，因为它正反两面都同样干净。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It is paper of native Indian manufacture,” he remarked. “It has at some time been pinned to a board. The diagram upon it appears to be a plan of part of a large building with numerous halls, corridors, and passages. At one point is a small cross done in red ink, and above it is ‘3.37 from left,’ in faded pencil-writing. In the left-hand corner is a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line with their arms touching. Beside it is written, in very rough and coarse characters, ‘The sign of the four—Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, Dost Akbar.’ No, I confess that I do not see how this bears upon the matter. Yet it is evidently a document of importance. It has been kept carefully in a pocketbook, for the one side is as clean as the other.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们的确是在爸爸的钱夹里找到它的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“It was in his pocketbook that we found it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那您就把它收好吧，莫斯坦小姐，因为我们没准儿会用得上它。现在我开始怀疑，案情可能会比我当初的设想严重得多，而且会更加难以把握。我必须重新考虑考虑。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Preserve it carefully, then, Miss Morstan, for it may prove to be of use to us. I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much deeper and more subtle than I at first supposed. I must reconsider my ideas.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他靠到了马车的座位上，而他紧锁的眉头和出神的眼睛告诉我，他正在进行紧张的思考。莫斯坦小姐和我小声地谈论着眼下的行动以及可能的结果，我们的旅伴却把无法打破的沉默保持到了旅程的终点。</td>
		<td class="en">He leaned back in the cab, and I could see by his drawn brow and his vacant eye that he was thinking intently. Miss Morstan and I chatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible outcome, but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve until the end of our journey.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这是一个九月的傍晚[^1]，时间还不到七点钟，只可惜天色阴沉，夹着细雨的浓浓雾气低低地笼罩着这座庞大的城市，色若泥泞的乌云无精打采地垂落在泥泞街道的上方。斯特兰街的路灯变成了一个个模糊的光点，漫射的灯光在湿滑的人行道上投下了一团团暗淡游移的光晕。商店橱窗里的明亮黄光渗入雨雾迷蒙的空气，化作一道道蒙胧的光幕，在人潮汹涌的通衢之中摇曳不定。络绎不绝的面孔从这些狭窄的光带之中次第闪过，或悲或喜，或哀或乐，实在让我觉得诡异莫名、如见鬼魅。这些面孔从黑暗之中闪入光明，又从光明之中回返黑暗，倏忽一如人类的命运。我这个人并不多愁善感，可是，这样一个阴郁沉重的傍晚，再加上我们面临的这个怪异事件，还是让我心情压抑、惶惑不安。从莫斯坦小姐的神态来看，她的心情也跟我一样烦乱。唯独福尔摩斯超然物外，完全不受这些琐细事由的影响。他把记事本摊在自己的膝盖上，借着便携提灯的光亮，不时地把一些数字和要点往本子上记。</td>
		<td class="en">It was a September evening and not yet seven o’clock, but the day had been a dreary one, and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city. Mud-coloured clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets. Down the Strand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light which threw a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement. The yellow glare from the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy, vaporous air and threw a murky, shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare. There was, to my mind, something eerie and ghostlike in the endless procession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of light—sad faces and glad, haggard and merry. Like all humankind, they flitted from the gloom into the light and so back into the gloom once more. I am not subject to impressions, but the dull, heavy evening, with the strange business upon which we were engaged, combined to make me nervous and depressed. I could see from Miss Morstan’s manner that she was suffering from the same feeling. Holmes alone could rise superior to petty influences. He held his open notebook upon his knee, and from time to time he jotted down figures and memoranda in the light of his pocket-lantern.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们到达兰心剧院的时候，剧院两边的入口已经人头攒动。源源不断的两轮马车和四轮马车从剧院的正前方辚辚驶过，卸下一摞一摞的“货物”，其中既有身着礼服、露着衬衫前襟的男士，也有围着披肩、珠光宝气的妇人。我们刚刚走到信中约定的第三根柱子跟前，有个人就走过来跟我们搭话。此人瘦小黧黑，动作敏捷，一身马夫的装扮。</td>
		<td class="en">At the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at the side-entrances. In front a continuous stream of hansoms and four-wheelers were rattling up, discharging their cargoes of shirt-fronted men and beshawled, bediamonded women. We had hardly reached the third pillar, which was our rendezvous, before a small, dark, brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你们是跟莫斯坦小姐一起的吗？”他问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“Are you the parties who come with Miss Morstan?” he asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我就是莫斯坦，这两位先生是我的朋友，”她答道。</td>
		<td class="en">“I am Miss Morstan, and these two gentlemen are my friends,” said she.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他向我们投来了咄咄逼人的探询目光。</td>
		<td class="en">He bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“您多包涵，小姐，”他的口气多少有些强硬，“可我还是得让您保证，您这两位朋友都不是警察。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You will excuse me, miss,” he said with a certain dogged manner, “but I was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions is a police-officer.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这一点我可以保证，”她回答道。</td>
		<td class="en">“I give you my word on that,” she answered.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那人尖声打了个唿哨，一名街头流浪儿便拉来一辆四轮马车，打开了车门。那人爬到车夫的座位上，我们则坐进了车厢。不等我们坐定，车夫就挥鞭打马，马车一头扎进雾蒙蒙的街道，开始狂奔起来。</td>
		<td class="en">He gave a shrill whistle, on which a street Arab led across a four-wheeler and opened the door. The man who had addressed us mounted to the box, while we took our places inside. We had hardly done so before the driver whipped up his horse, and we plunged away at a furious pace through the foggy streets.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >眼下的局面非常怪异，因为我们驱车前行，既不知道终点何在，也不知道所为何事。话又说回来，除非我们收到的邀请是一个彻头彻尾的骗局——那样的设想简直不可思议——否则我们就有充分的理由相信，此行将会产生重大的后果。莫斯坦小姐的表现一如既往地坚强镇定，我则讲起了以前在阿富汗的一些冒险经历，为的是逗她开心。不过，说实在话，我自己倒是被眼前的局面弄得非常紧张，又对此行的目的地感到非常好奇，讲起故事来就有点儿不着边际。直到今天，她仍然一口咬定，说我当时给她讲过一则感人至深的轶闻，内容是一头火枪如何在夜静更深的时候窥探我的帐篷，我又如何抄起一支双筒小老虎冲它开火。行程刚开始的时候，我还对车行的方向有一点儿概念。可是，由于车子很快，雾很浓，我对伦敦的了解又很有限，没多久我就晕头转向，除了知道路似乎很长之外，别的就什么也不知道了。不过，歇洛克·福尔摩斯始终不曾迷失方向。车子在各个广场和曲里拐弯的小街上钻进钻出的时候，他念念有词地报出了它们的名字。</td>
		<td class="en">The situation was a curious one. We were driving to an unknown place, on an unknown errand. Yet our invitation was either a complete hoax—which was an inconceivable hypothesis—or else we had good reason to think that important issues might hang upon our journey. Miss Morstan’s demeanour was as resolute and collected as ever. I endeavoured to cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventures in Afghanistan; but, to tell the truth, I was myself so excited at our situation and so curious as to our destination that my stories were slightly involved. To this day she declares that I told her one moving anecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night, and how I fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it. At first I had some idea as to the direction in which we were driving, but soon, what with our pace, the fog, and my own limited knowledge of London, I lost my bearings and knew nothing save that we seemed to be going a very long way. Sherlock Holmes was never at fault, however, and he muttered the names as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by tortuous bystreets.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“罗切斯特街，”他说道。“现在是文森特广场，现在又到了沃萨桥路。我们显然是在往萨里郡[^2]那边走。是的，应该没错。现在我们上了一座桥，你们瞧瞧，可以瞥见河里的波光。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Rochester Row,” said he. “Now Vincent Square. Now we come out on the Vauxhall Bridge Road. We are making for the Surrey side apparently. Yes, I thought so. Now we are on the bridge. You can catch glimpses of the river.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们的确看到泰晤士河从眼前一掠而过，看到灯火在宽广静默的水面闪耀。不过，马车仍然在飞速前行，很快就钻进了河对岸的一座街巷迷宫。</td>
		<td class="en">We did indeed get a fleeting view of a stretch of the Thames, with the lamps shining upon the broad, silent water; but our cab dashed on and was soon involved in a labyrinth of streets upon the other side.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“华兹华斯路，”我的同伴说道。“普莱利路。拉克霍巷。斯托克韦尔广场。罗伯特街。冷港巷。看起来，我们要去的并不是什么高尚地方啊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Wordsworth Road,” said my companion. “Priory Road. Lark Hall Lane. Stockwell Place. Robert Street. Cold Harbour Lane. Our quest does not appear to take us to very fashionable regions.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >没错，我们已经进入了一片暧昧可疑、阴森可怕的街区。街面上是一长排一长排的黑暗砖房，打破阴郁的只有街角那些酒馆发出的俗丽灯光。接下来则是一排排双层别墅，每一座别墅的门前都有一个微型的花园，再下来又是一排排崭新刺目的砖头建筑，长得似乎没有尽头，如同庞大城市伸向乡间的一根根丑陋触须。最后，马车终于在一条新街上的第三座房子跟前停了下来。街上的其他房屋都没有人居住，我们面前的这座房子也跟邻家一样黑灯瞎火，只是厨房的窗子里透着一点亮光。不过，我们刚一敲门，门马上就开了，开门的是一个印度仆人，顶着黄色的缠头布，穿着宽松的白袍，还系着一条黄色的腰带。眼前不过是一幢三流的郊区住宅，平平无奇的门廊里竟然站着一名东方仆人，让人觉得既怪异又不协调。</td>
		<td class="en">We had indeed reached a questionable and forbidding neighbourhood. Long lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glare and tawdry brilliancy of public-houses at the corner. Then came rows of two-storied villas, each with a fronting of miniature garden, and then again interminable lines of new, staring brick buildings—the monster tentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the country. At last the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace. None of the other houses were inhabited, and that at which we stopped was as dark as its neighbours, save for a single glimmer in the kitchen-window. On our knocking, however, the door was instantly thrown open by a Hindoo servant, clad in a yellow turban, white loose-fitting clothes, and a yellow sash. There was something strangely incongruous in this Oriental figure framed in the commonplace doorway of a third-rate suburban dwelling-house.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“老爷[^3]在等你们呢，”他说道。就在他说话的同时，房子的某间内室里传来了一个又高又尖的声音。</td>
		<td class="en">“The sahib awaits you,” said he, and even as he spoke, there came a high, piping voice from some inner room.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“领他们进来见我，吉特默迦[^4]，”那声音说道。“直接领他们过来。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Show them in to me, *khitmutgar*,” it said. “Show them straight in to me.”</td></tr>
