		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >四十年来，一位夫家姓沃盖，娘家姓德孔夫兰的老妇人在位于拉丁区和圣马塞尔郊区之间的新圣热讷维耶沃街上开着一个家庭旅馆。</td>
		<td class="en">Mme. Vauquer (@nee@ de Conflans) is an elderly person, who for the past forty years has kept a lodging-house in the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, in the district that lies between the Latin Quarter and the Faubourg Saint-Marcel.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这家被邻里称为“沃盖之家”的旅馆，不论男女老少一概接待，而且从未受过流言蜚语的攻击。但是实际上，三十年以来，从来都没有年轻女子住过那里。而如果一个年轻人在那里住了很长时间，就必然说明着他的零花钱少得可怜。</td>
		<td class="en">Her house (known in the neighborhood as the @Maison Vauquer@) receives men and women, old and young, and no word has ever been breathed against her respectable establishment; but, at the same time, it must be said that as a matter of fact no young woman has been under her roof for thirty years, and that if a young man stays there for any length of time it is a sure sign that his allowance must be of the slenderest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，当这幕戏剧在一八一九年拉开帷幕时，“沃盖之家”里的确有一名几乎身无分文的年轻女房客。</td>
		<td class="en">In 1819, however, the time when this drama opens, there was an almost penniless young girl among Mme. Vauquer’s boarders.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >虽然近来戏剧这个字眼被那些基调伤感的文学作品滥用、扭曲，以致都有些不足信了，但是，在这里还是得用上它。这并不是因为从有限的字义上来讲，这个故事具有戏剧性，而是因为在这部戏剧结束之前，城里城外的人也许会掉几滴眼泪。</td>
		<td class="en">That word drama has been somewhat discredited of late; it has been overworked and twisted to strange uses in these days of dolorous literature; but it must do service again here, not because this story is dramatic in the restricted sense of the word, but because some tears may perhaps be shed @intra et extra muros@ before it is over.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >巴黎以外的人是否能懂得这部作品呢？这一点还不得而知。</td>
		<td class="en">Will any one without the walls of Paris understand it? It is open to doubt.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >只有居住在蒙鲁日和蒙马特尔高地之间的人才会欣赏我对细微之处和地方特色的细致观察和详尽再现。条条溪流携带着黑色泥浆将谷地里的泥灰冲得粉碎。在那里，悲伤才是真实的，而快乐往往是空洞的。但是，那里的人们对苦难已经如此司空见惯了，以致于只有出人意料、世间罕有的不幸才能给他们留下一点印象。</td>
		<td class="en">The only audience who could appreciate the results of close observation, the careful reproduction of minute detail and local color, are dwellers between the heights of Montrouge and Montmartre, in a vale of crumbling stucco watered by streams of black mud, a vale of sorrows which are real and joys too often hollow; but this audience is so accustomed to terrible sensations, that only some unimaginable and well-neigh impossible woe could produce any lasting impression there.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >美德和邪恶会时不时地夹杂在一起引发一些悲剧。这些悲剧是如此悲惨而又如此壮烈。连自负、自私的人也会为之一怔，继而生出点滴的同情心。可是他们的同情就好比一颗甘美的果实，转眼就被吞噬殆尽。</td>
		<td class="en">Now and again there are tragedies so awful and so grand by reason of the complication of virtues and vices that bring them about, that egotism and selfishness are forced to pause and are moved to pity; but the impression that they receive is like a luscious fruit, soon consumed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >文明就像世界主宰的马车。它在行进过程中，若是碰到一颗比较不容易粉碎的心，就会停下来，等到粉碎它之后，才继续得意洋洋地前进。</td>

		<td class="en">And you, too, will do the like; you who with this book in your white hand will sink back among the cushions of your armchair, and say to yourself, “Perhaps this may amuse me.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >读过高老头隐秘的痛史后，你的胃口会一如既往，然后把自己的冷漠归咎于作者，指责他夸大其词、胡编滥造。</td>
		<td class="en">You will read the story of Father Goriot’s secret woes, and, dining thereafter with an unspoiled appetite, will lay the blame of your insensibility upon the writer, and accuse him of exaggeration, of writing romances.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >哎！这部悲剧绝对既非虚构也非编造！</td>
		<td class="en">Ah! once for all, this drama is neither a fiction nor a romance!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一切都是事实——真实到每个人都能在自己的家中，也许在自己的心中，或多或少觉察到书中的情节。</td>
		<td class="en">ALL IS TRUE,—so true, that every one can discern the elements of the tragedy in his own house, perhaps in his own heart.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这家旅馆是沃盖夫人自己的产业。</td>
		<td class="en">The lodging-house is Mme. Vauquer’s own property.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >它现在仍然矗立在新圣热讷维耶沃街的下段。路面就是从这里开始陡然下降到了拉尔巴特大街。因为这一路段石头多、坡度大，很少有马车经过。</td>
		<td class="en">It is still standing in the lower end of the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, just where the road slopes so sharply down to the Rue de l’Arbalete, that wheeled traffic seldom passes that way, because it is so stony and steep.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >正是这种地势让夹在先贤祠穹顶与恩典谷教堂穹顶间的街道变得无比寂静。这两座引人注目的公共建筑给这里的风光染上了微黄的色调。在它们铅灰色穹顶阴影的笼罩下，整个区域都显得暗淡无光。</td>
		<td class="en">This position is sufficient to account for the silence prevalent in the streets shut in between the dome of the Pantheon and the dome of the Val-de-Grace, two conspicuous public buildings which give a yellowish tone to the landscape and darken the whole district that lies beneath the shadow of their leaden-hued cupolas.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >人行道又干净又干燥，阴沟里既没有泥也没有水，墙缝里长满了草。</td>
		<td class="en">In that district the pavements are clean and dry, there is neither mud nor water in the gutters, grass grows in the chinks of the walls.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >连最漫不经心的路人也会感受到此处的压抑，马车在此经过的声音也会引起一阵不小的骚动。房子看上去阴森森的，花园四周的高墙使人联想到监狱。</td>
		<td class="en">The most heedless passer-by feels the depressing influences of a place where the sound of wheels creates a sensation; there is a grim look about the houses, a suggestion of a jail about those high garden walls.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个迷路的巴黎人在这片只有旅馆和公共机构的郊区，只会看到贫穷、沉闷、躺着等死的老人和本该快乐却不得不做苦役的年轻人。</td>
		<td class="en">A Parisian straying into a suburb apparently composed of lodging-houses and public institutions would see poverty and dullness, old age lying down to die, and joyous youth condemned to drudgery.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >它是巴黎最丑陋的地区，也许是最不为人知的一个区域。</td>
		<td class="en">It is the ugliest quarter of Paris, and, it may be added, the least known.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，首先映入眼帘的是新圣热讷维耶沃街。它就像是一个古铜色的相框，里面装着一张充斥着悲哀色调和严肃景象的照片，让人看了之后很难接受这一区域内部是多么破败。</td>
		<td class="en">But, before all things, the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve is like a bronze frame for a picture for which the mind cannot be too well prepared by the contemplation of sad hues and sober images.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管如此，太阳渐渐落山了，游客越来越接近地下墓穴，导游低沉的声音也变得越来越来空洞了。</td>
		<td class="en">Even so, step by step the daylight decreases, and the cicerone’s droning voice grows hollower as the traveler descends into the Catacombs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >对比依然很明显！</td>
		<td class="en">The comparison holds good!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >谁就能说哪一个更恐怖，是漂白的骷髅头还是干涸的人类心灵？</td>
		<td class="en">Who shall say which is more ghastly, the sight of the bleached skulls or of dried-up human hearts?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >旅馆正面和路面呈直角，朝向一个小花园。因此，房子的侧面看上去就像是新圣热讷维耶沃街的一部分。</td>
		<td class="en">The front of the lodging-house is at right angles to the road, and looks out upon a little garden, so that you see the side of the house in section, as it were, from the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >房屋正面的墙下有一条六英尺宽的沟渠，里面铺着鹅卵石，旁边是一条砂砾小道，道旁放着蓝白相间的大陶盆，里面种着天竺葵、夹竹桃和石榴树。</td>
		<td class="en">Beneath the wall of the house front there lies a channel, a fathom wide, paved with cobble-stones, and beside it runs a graveled walk bordered by geraniums and oleanders and pomegranates set in great blue and white glazed earthenware pots.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >砂砾小道的一头有一扇门，上面钉着一块牌子，写着“沃盖之家”，下面还有一行小字“男女房客，一律欢迎。”边门上装着一只门铃。白天的时候，人们可以透过边门轻而易举地瞥见园中的景色。</td>
		<td class="en">Access into the graveled walk is afforded by a door, above which the words MAISON VAUQUER may be read, and beneath, in rather smaller letters, “@Lodgings for both sexes, etc.@” During the day a glimpse into the garden is easily obtained through a wicket to which a bell is attached.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >小道远端的墙（与小道另一端的门相对）上面画着一扇绿色大理石拱门。这是当地某位画家画的。画中的拱门酷似神龛，中间立着丘比特塑像。这是一个巴黎版的丘比特，全身变得凹凸不平，样貌被损毁，看上去仿佛一位急需就近接受治疗的病人，不过热爱象征主义的人也许会把它当成一幅寓意画。</td>
		<td class="en">On the opposite wall, at the further end of the graveled walk, a green marble arch was painted once upon a time by a local artist, and in this semblance of a shrine a statue representing Cupid is installed; a Parisian Cupid, so blistered and disfigured that he looks like a candidate for one of the adjacent hospitals, and might suggest an allegory to lovers of symbolism.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >神像底座上模糊不清的铭文记载着这幅作品的完成日期。它见证了一七七七年伏尔泰返回巴黎，大受欢迎的时刻。“不管你是谁，你的师傅在这里；他是今在，昔在，永在的师傅。”</td>
		<td class="en">The half-obliterated inscription on the pedestal beneath determines the date of this work of art, for it bears witness to the widespread enthusiasm felt for Voltaire on his return to Paris in 1777: “Whoe’er thou art, thy master see; He is, or was, or ought to be.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >晚上，格条边门会被换成板门。</td>
		<td class="en">At night the wicket gate is replaced by a solid door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >小花园和房子的正面一般宽，一头是临街的墙，一头是和邻居家分界的墙。</td>
		<td class="en">The little garden is no wider than the front of the house; it is shut in between the wall of the street and the partition wall of the neighboring house.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >常春藤密密麻麻地遮住了砖块，吸引着路人的眼球。这幅景象在巴黎是一道很独特的风景。每面墙上都有连成格子状的葡萄藤，藤上结着灰蒙蒙的小果实。这些葡萄藤也为沃盖夫人和她的房客提供了闲谈的话题。每年葡萄收获的时候，这个寡妇都会为之担忧。</td>
		<td class="en">A mantle of ivy conceals the bricks and attracts the eyes of passers-by to an effect which is picturesque in Paris, for each of the walls is covered with trellised vines that yield a scanty dusty crop of fruit, and furnish besides a subject of conversation for Mme. Vauquer and her lodgers; every year the widow trembles for her vintage.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >花园的每一边都有一条笔直的小径，小径远处的尽头是一片菩提树林。沃盖夫人虽然是孔夫兰出身，可却坚持要称它为蒲提树林，就算房客们不停地纠正也不管用。</td>
		<td class="en">A straight path beneath the walls on either side of the garden leads to a clump of lime-trees at the further end of it; @line@-trees, as Mme. Vauquer persists in calling them, in spite of the fact that she was a de Conflans, and regardless of repeated corrections from her lodgers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两面墙之间的空地上种着一大片洋蓟和一排排宝塔形状的果树，四周还种着生菜、野菜和欧芹。</td>
		<td class="en">The central space between the walls is filled with artichokes and rows of pyramid fruit-trees, and surrounded by a border of lettuce, pot-herbs, and parsley.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >菩提树下有一张木桌子和几张漆成绿色的庭院长椅。三伏天的时候，即使热得在树阴下都能烘熟鸡蛋，喝得起咖啡的房客也会到这里来喝咖啡、玩乐。</td>
		<td class="en">Under the lime-trees there are a few green-painted garden seats and a wooden table, and hither, during the dog-days, such of the lodgers as are rich enough to indulge in a cup of coffee come to take their pleasure, though it is hot enough to roast eggs even in the shade.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不算屋檐下的阁楼，“沃盖之家”共有四层楼。</td>
		<td class="en">The house itself is three stories high, without counting the attics under the roof.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >房子是用粗砂石建成的，外面用泥灰刷成了淡黄色。巴黎几乎每一幢房子都粉刷成了这种丑陋不堪的颜色。</td>
		<td class="en">It is built of rough stone, and covered with the yellowish stucco that gives a mean appearance to almost every house in Paris.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在房子正面，每一层都有五个窗户；透过小块的方形窗格，所有能看见的百叶窗都挂歪了，使得百叶窗片全都变得横七竖八。</td>
		<td class="en">There are five windows in each story in the front of the house; all the blinds visible through the small square panes are drawn up awry, so that the lines are all at cross purposes.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >房子后面的院子伸展出去约有二十英尺。猪、家禽和兔子如同一家人一般快乐地住在这里。稍远的一边是堆放木材的棚子。棚子和厨房窗户之间的墙上挂着一个食品橱，正下方是洗碗池。一股股油腻的污水就是从池子里排出的。　</td>
		<td class="en">Behind the house a yard extends for some twenty feet, a space inhabited by a happy family of pigs, poultry, and rabbits; the wood-shed is situated on the further side, and on the wall between the wood-shed and the kitchen window hangs the meat-safe, just above the place where the sink discharges its greasy streams.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >为了避免瘟疫，厨师把所有的垃圾都从一个小门扫到了新圣热讷维耶沃街上，还经常用源源不断的水冲洗院子。</td>
		<td class="en">The cook sweeps all the refuse out through a little door into the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, and frequently cleanses the yard with copious supplies of water, under pain of pestilence.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >客厅里的另一扇门通往餐厅。餐厅和厨房之间隔着楼梯井。楼梯的台阶一部分是用木板建的，一部分是用地砖建的。两部分都上了颜色，打了蜂蜡。</td>
		<td class="en">Another door opens out of it into the dining-room, which is separated from the kitchen by the well of the staircase, the steps being constructed partly of wood, partly of tiles, which are colored and beeswaxed.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两扇窗户之间挂着一幅画供房客们欣赏。这幅画描述的是海之女神卡吕普索为尤利西斯之子举办盛宴的场面。这四十年来，年轻人都拿它开玩笑。他们取笑因为贫穷所迫而不得不接受的晚餐，来说明自己本应处于更优越的环境。</td>
		<td class="en">The subject between the two windows is the banquet given by Calypso to the son of Ulysses, displayed thereon for the admiration of the boarders, and has furnished jokes these forty years to the young men who show themselves superior to their position by making fun of the dinners to which poverty condemns them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >壁炉前的地面总是那么干净、整洁，很明显壁炉只有在重要场合才会点火；石砌的壁炉架上放着一对花瓶作为装饰，里面装着褪色的假花，上面盖着玻璃罩子；两只花瓶中间摆着一个品味很差的浅蓝色大理石摆钟。</td>
		<td class="en">The hearth is always so clean and neat that it is evident that a fire is only kindled there on great occasions; the stone chimney-piece is adorned by a couple of vases filled with faded artificial flowers imprisoned under glass shades, on either side of a bluish marble clock in the very worst taste.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当你呼吸这里潮湿的空气时，那种憋闷、腐臭、霉烂的味道直让你发冷，还直往衣服里钻；用餐过后，那股气味更像是融合了厨房的味道、洗碗池的味道，还有医院的臭味。</td>
		<td class="en">The damp atmosphere sends a chill through you as you breathe it; it has a stuffy, musty, and rancid quality; it permeates your clothing; after-dinner scents seem to be mingled in it with smells from the kitchen and scullery and the reek of a hospital.</td></tr>
