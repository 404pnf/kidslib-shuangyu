		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“干谷”约翰逊摇了摇瓶子。在使用之前你得把瓶子摇一摇，因为硫磺是不可溶解的。然后，“干谷”用一小块海绵蘸了这种液体，小心翼翼地擦到他的发根上。除了硫磺，里面还有铅糖、马钱子酊和月桂朗姆酒。“干谷”是在一份星期日报上找到这个配方的。下面你就会知道为什么一个真正的男子汉会成为“美容建议”的牺牲品。</td>
		<td class="en">Dry Valley Johnson shook the bottle.You have to shake the bottle before using; for sulphur will not dissolve.Then Dry Valley saturated a small sponge with the liquid and rubbed it carefully into the roots of his hair.Besides sulphur there was sugar of lead in it and tincture of nux vomica and bay rum.Dry Valley found the recipe in a Sunday newspaper.You must next be told why a strong man came to fall a victim to a Beauty Hint.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“干谷”以前是一个牧羊人。他的真名叫赫克托，但人们用他的牧场给他又起了一个名字，从而把他和在远处的弗里奥放羊的“榆树溪”约翰逊区分开来。</td>
		<td class="en">Dry Valley had been a sheepman.His real name was Hector, but he had been rechristened after his range to distinguish him from “Elm Creek” Johnson, who ran sheep further down the Frio.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >多年来整日对着羊群，迁就着它们的生活习性，“干谷”约翰逊感到了厌倦。因此，他以一万八千美元的价钱卖掉了牧场，搬到圣罗莎，过上了绅士般的舒适生活。作为一个三十五岁——或者三十八岁——沉默而忧郁的人，他很快就成为了被诅咒的对象和地球的累赘——一个有爱好的上了年纪的单身汉。有人给了他生平第一颗草莓吃，使他深陷其中。</td>
		<td class="en">Many years of living face to face with sheep on their own terms wearied Dry Valley Johnson.So, he sold his ranch for eighteen thousand dollars and moved to Santa Rosa to live a life of gentlemanly ease.Being a silent and melancholy person of thirty-five—or perhaps thirty-eight—he soon became that cursed and earth-cumbering thing—an elderlyish bachelor with a hobby.Some one gave him his first strawberry to eat, and he was done for.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“干谷”在村里买了一幢四间房的农舍和一大堆关于草莓文化的书，足够开家图书馆了。农舍的后面是一个园子，他在那里种上了草莓。他穿着灰色旧羊毛衫、棕色帆布裤和高跟靴，整天躺在后门外一棵活橡树下的帆布吊床上，研究这诱人的红色浆果的历史。</td>
		<td class="en">Dry Valley bought a four-room cottage in the village, and a library on strawberry culture.Behind the cottage was a garden of which he made a strawberry patch.In his old grey woolen shirt, his brown duck trousers, and high-heeled boots he sprawled all day on a canvas cot under a live-oak tree at his back door studying the history of the seductive, scarlet berry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >学校里的老师德威特小姐说他是一个“虽然人到中年，却仍然优秀像样的男人”。但是，“干谷”的眼里没有女人。对他来说，她们只不过是穿着裙子的人而已。每次遇到她们，都意味着他会笨拙地掀起他那沉重的圆顶阔边斯泰森毡帽，然后匆忙走开，回到他心爱的草莓那儿。</td>
		<td class="en">The school teacher, Miss De Witt, spoke of him as “a fine, presentable man, for all his middle age.”But, the focus of Dry Valley’s eyes embraced no women.They were merely beings who flew skirts as a signal for him to lift awkwardly his heavy, round-crowned, broad-brimmed felt Stetson whenever he met them, and then hurry past to get back to his beloved berries.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >前面所说的一切都是合唱的宣叙部分，不过是为了做足铺垫，然后告诉大家“干谷”为什么要摇晃瓶子里不溶解的硫磺。历史是如此漫长而不合逻辑的东西——在我们身后的路上，落日投下了里程碑那扭曲的影子。</td>
		<td class="en">And all this recitative by the chorus is only to bring us to the point where you may be told why Dry Valley shook up the insoluble sulphur in the bottle.So long-drawn and inconsequential a thing is history—the anamorphous shadow of a milestone reaching down the road between us and the setting sun.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当他的草莓开始成熟时，“干谷”在圣罗莎商店里买了最沉的马车鞭子。他在那棵活橡树底下坐了好几个小时，以便把鞭子编得更长些。鞭子编好后，他能用噼啪作响的鞭梢打掉二十英尺外灌木林中的树叶。因为圣罗莎的年轻人正用那明亮的眼睛虎视眈眈地盯着将要成熟的草莓，所以“干谷”武装自己以应付他们迟早要发动的袭击。 即使是在放牧的日子里，他那些温顺的羔羊也未曾享受过如此悉心的照顾。他保护他心爱的水果免于遭受饿狼的袭击，他们吹着口哨、嚎叫着、发射弹球，还透过环绕着他园子的篱笆向内窥视。</td>
		<td class="en">When his strawberries were beginning to ripen Dry Valley bought the heaviest buggy whip in the Santa Rosa store.He sat for many hours under the live oak tree plaiting and weaving in an extension to its lash.When it was done he could snip a leaf from a bush twenty feet away with the cracker.For the bright, predatory eyes of Santa Rosa youth were watching the ripening berries, and Dry Valley was arming himself against their expected raids.No greater care had he taken of his tender lambs during his ranching days than he did of his cherished fruit, warding it from the hungry wolves that whistled and howled and shot their marbles and peered through the fence that surrounded his property.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“干谷”旁边的房子里住着一个寡妇和一群孩子，这一点让这个农夫时常感到忧虑。这个女人有西班牙血统。她曾和一个姓奥布赖恩的男人结婚。“干谷”在混血方面是个行家；他早就预料到这些混血后代会给他带来麻烦。</td>
		<td class="en">In the house next to Dry Valley’s lived a widow with a pack of children that gave the husbandman frequent anxious misgivings.In the woman there was a strain of the Spanish.She had wedded one of the name of O’Brien.Dry Valley was a connoisseur in cross strains; and he foresaw trouble in the offspring of this union.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >两家之间隔着一道不牢固的尖桩篱笆，长满了牵牛花和野葫芦藤。他经常看到一些小脑袋，顶着乱蓬蓬的黑头发，黑色的眼睛闪烁着，在尖木桩之间躲躲闪闪，密切关注着那些正在变红的莓果。</td>
		<td class="en">Between the two homesteads ran a crazy picket fence overgrown with morning glory and wild gourd vines.Often he could see little heads with mops of black hair and flashing dark eyes dodging in and out between the pickets, keeping tabs on the reddening berries.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天傍晚，“干谷”去了趟邮局。当他回到家时，像童谣中的哈伯德大妈一样，他看到了一片狼藉。伊比利亚强盗和爱尔兰偷牛贼的后代们突袭了他的草莓地。在愤怒的“干谷”看来，那里好像有满满一羊栏的入侵者；或许有五六个。在这一行行绿色植物间，他们弯着腰，像癞蛤蟆一样跳跃着，悄悄地、贪婪地吞食着他最好的果实。</td>
		<td class="en">Late one afternoon Dry Valley went to the post office.When he came back, like Mother Hubbard he found the deuce to pay.The descendants of Iberian bandits and Hibernian cattle raiders had swooped down upon his strawberry patch.To the outraged vision of Dry Valley there seemed to be a sheep corral full of them; perhaps they numbered five or six.Between the rows of green plants they were stooped, hopping about like toads, gobbling silently and voraciously his finest fruit.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“干谷”溜进屋里，拿起鞭子，抽向那些掠夺者。鞭子卷住了最近的一个孩子的腿——一个贪吃的十岁小孩——这时，他们才知道自己已经被发现了。他的尖叫声给其他孩子发出了警告；于是他们就像一群野猪冲向丛林那样向篱笆那边奔去。在他们钻过蔓藤覆盖的篱笆并消失不见之前，“干谷”的鞭子又让两个淘气鬼发出了尖叫声。</td>
		<td class="en">Dry Valley slipped into the house, got his whip, and charged the marauders.The lash curled about the legs of the nearest—a greedy ten-year-old—before they knew they were discovered.His screech gave warning; and the flock scampered for the fence like a drove of javelis flushed in the chaparral.Dry Valley’s whip drew a toll of two more elfin shrieks before they dived through the vine-clad fence and disappeared.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“干谷”没有他们跑得快，但也快追到了尖木桩的位置。他停止了自己徒劳的追赶，绕过灌木丛，放下鞭子站在那儿，不出声响，一动不动，他的力气全被喘息和保持站立的动作消耗了。</td>
		<td class="en">Dry Valley, less fleet, followed them nearly to the pickets.Checking his useless pursuit, he rounded a bush, dropped his whip and stood, voiceless, motionless, the capacity of his powers consumed by the act of breathing and preserving the perpendicular.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在灌木丛后面站着不屑于逃跑的潘吉达·奥布赖恩。她十九岁，是这些入侵者中最大的。她乌黑的头发胡乱地拢在脑后，用一条红丝带扎着。她不情愿地站在那里。她已经近乎是个少女，但却更像个孩子。由于孩子的心理占了上风，她没有继续逃跑。</td>
		<td class="en">Behind the bush stood Panchita O’Brien, scorning to fly.She was nineteen, the oldest of the raiders.Her night-black hair was gathered back in a wild mass and tied with a scarlet ribbon.She stood, with reluctant feet, yet nearer the brook than to the river; for childhood had environed and detained her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她十分傲慢无礼地盯了“干谷”约翰逊一会儿，当着他的面用她那洁白的牙齿慢慢地嚼着一颗甘美的草莓。然后，她转过身，故意地慢慢摇摆着走向篱笆，像是一位公爵夫人在招摇地散步。在那里，她又转过身，用她那放肆的闪着黑色火焰般的眼睛再次灼烧着“干谷”约翰逊，脸上带着像女学生一样的嘲笑，像美洲豹一样敏捷地挤过尖木桩，到了长着野葫芦藤的奥布赖恩家那边了。</td>
		<td class="en">She looked at Dry Valley Johnson for a moment with magnificent insolence, and before his eyes slowly crunched a luscious berry between her white teeth.Then she turned and walked slowly to the fence with a swaying, conscious motion, such as a duchess might make use of in leading a promenade.There she turned again and grilled Dry Valley Johnson once more in the dark flame of her audacious eyes, laughed a trifle school-girlishly, and twisted herself with pantherish quickness between the pickets to the O’Brien side of the wild gourd vine.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“干谷”捡起鞭子，走进屋里。他走上那两级木台阶时脚步踉跄了一下。穿过房间时，给他做饭并打扫屋子的墨西哥老女人叫他吃晚饭。“干谷”继续往前走，跌跌撞撞地下了前面的台阶，出了门，沿着路走进了镇边的牧豆树丛。他坐在草地上，费力地拔着一棵仙人掌上的刺，一根接着一根。这就是他思考的方式，早在他的问题只与风向、羊毛和水源有关时就形成了。</td>
		<td class="en">Dry Valley picked up his whip and went into his house.He stumbled as he went up the two wooden steps.The old Mexican woman who cooked his meals and swept his house called him to supper as he went through the rooms.Dry Valley went on, stumbled down the front steps, out the gate and down the road into a mesquite thicket at the edge of town.He sat down in the grass and laboriously plucked the spines from a prickly pear, one by one.This was his attitude of thought, acquired in the days when his problems were only those of wind and wool and water.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在这个男人身上发生了一件事——这件事，如果你有资格遇到的话，一定要祈祷它不会缠上你。他已经被困在心灵的小阳春里了。</td>
		<td class="en">A thing had happened to the man—a thing that, if you are eligible, you must pray may pass you by.He had become enveloped in the Indian Summer of the Soul.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“干谷”从来没有经历过青年时代。连他的童年也是一本正经、严肃认真的。六岁时，他看着父亲牧场上羔羊们轻佻的耍闹，心中就默默地表示了谴责。他年轻时的生命已经被浪费了。神圣的热情和冲动、绚丽的得意和绝望、青春的光辉和魅力都已经从他头顶飘过。他从来没有过罗密欧的激动；他只是森林中一位忧郁的贾克斯，但他的哲学与贾克斯相比略显粗浅，他身上也没有这个游侠在崎岖的阿登山区里多年沧桑、苦甜参半的经历。</td>
		<td class="en">Dry Valley had had no youth.Even his childhood had been one of dignity and seriousness.At six he had viewed the frivolous gambols of the lambs on his father’s ranch with silent disapproval.His life as a young man had been wasted.The divine fires and impulses, the glorious exaltations and despairs, the glow and enchantment of youth had passed above his head.Never a thrill of Romeo had he known; he was but a melancholy Jaques of the forest with a ruder philosophy, lacking the bitter-sweet flavour of experience that tempered the veteran years of the rugged ranger of Arden.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如今他就像是一片枯黄的叶子，在潘吉达·奥布赖恩轻蔑的一瞥下，这一片秋景顿时充斥着迟缓而虚幻的夏热。</td>
		<td class="en">And now in his sere and yellow leaf one scornful look from the eyes of Panchita O’Brien had flooded the autumnal landscape with a tardy and delusive summer heat.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但牧羊人是一种坚强的动物。“干谷”约翰逊经历过太多凛冽的北风，即便已近夏末，他也决不放弃，无论是在精神上还是在现实里都是如此。老了吗？他会做给他们看的。</td>
		<td class="en">But a sheepman is a hardy animal.Dry Valley Johnson had weathered too many northers to turn his back on a late summer, spiritual or real.Old?He would show them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的下一封信件寄到了圣安东尼奥，定购了一套最时髦的衣服，颜色、样式和价格都不是问题。第二天他从一张报纸上剪下了那个修复头发的配方；因为“干谷”被太阳灼伤的赤褐色头发已经开始从鬓角变成银色。</td>
		<td class="en">By the next mail went an order to San Antonio for an outfit of the latest clothes, colours and styles and prices no object.The next day went the recipe for the hair restorer clipped from a newspaper; for Dry Valley’s sunburned auburn hair was beginning to turn silvery above his ears.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >除了对年轻的草莓抢夺者的频繁出击，“干谷”闭门不出，在家呆了一个星期。接着，几天过后，他突然容光焕发地出现了，带着他那迟来的仲夏疯狂，脸上洋溢着兴奋的红光。</td>
		<td class="en">Dry Valley kept indoors closely for a week except for frequent sallies after youthful strawberry snatchers.Then, a few days later, he suddenly emerged brilliantly radiant in the hectic glow of his belated midsummer madness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他外面穿了一件松鸦蓝的网球服，几乎盖住了他的手腕和脚踝。他的衬衫是牛血色的；领子高高竖起；领带像飘扬的军旗；鞋子是刺眼的棕褐色，像是按照苦修者的鞋型做的。一顶带有条纹带子的扁平小草帽亵渎了他那饱经风霜的脑袋。柠檬色的羊皮手套保护着他橡树般粗糙的手，以免被温和的五月阳光晒到。这个生物让人看了大吃一惊，却又为他感到可怜，他摇摆着从自己的洞穴里走出来，傻傻地笑着，抚弄着它的手套，展示给人们和天使们看。丘比特经常用莫摩斯箭袋里的箭射取一些过时的猎物，“干谷”约翰逊就被他变成了这个样子。“干谷”改写了神话，他就像一只灰褐色的凤凰，栖息在圣罗莎树下，折起疲惫的翅膀，浴火重生，当他从灰烬中站起时，却成了一只色彩斑斓的金刚鹦鹉。</td>
		<td class="en">A jay-bird-blue tennis suit covered him outwardly, almost as far as his wrists and ankles.His shirt was ox-blood; his collar winged and tall; his necktie a floating oriflamme; his shoes a venomous bright tan, pointed and shaped on penitential lasts.A little flat straw hat with a striped band desecrated his weather-beaten head.Lemon-coloured kid gloves protected his oak-tough hands from the benignant May sunshine.This sad and optic-smiting creature teetered out of its den, smiling foolishly and smoothing its gloves for men and angels to see.To such a pass had Dry Valley Johnson been brought by Cupid, who always shoots game that is out of season with an arrow from the quiver of Momus.Reconstructing mythology, he had risen, a prismatic macaw, from the ashes of the grey-brown phoenix that had folded its tired wings to roost under the trees of Santa Rosa.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“干谷”在街上停留了一会儿，使得圣罗莎的人们都能看到他并为之惊叹；然后故意放慢脚步，按着鞋子所允许的速度，走进了奥布赖恩太太的家门。</td>
		<td class="en">Dry Valley paused in the street to allow Santa Rosans within sight of him to be stunned; and then deliberately and slowly, as his shoes required, entered Mrs. O’Brien’s gate.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >直到发生那场连续十一个月的大旱，圣罗莎的人们才停止谈论“干谷”约翰逊对潘吉达·奥布赖恩求爱的事。他的求爱方式是个无法归类的过程；有点儿像阔步舞、聋哑表演、小范围调情和字谜游戏的混合体。他的追求持续了两周，然后突然停止了。</td>
		<td class="en">Not until the eleven months’ drought did Santa Rosa cease talking about Dry Valley Johnson’s courtship of Panchita O’Brien.It was an unclassifiable procedure; something like a combination of cake-walking, deaf-and-dumb oratory, postage stamp flirtation and parlour charades.It lasted two weeks and then came to a sudden end.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当然，“干谷”一透露他的意图，奥布赖恩太太就赞成他们在一起。作为一个少女的母亲，又因此而成为“老式捕鼠会”的创办人，她高兴地把潘吉达打扮起来当作牺牲品。这个女孩穿着长裙，头发盘在头顶，一时变得得意忘形，几乎忘了自己不过是一块作为诱饵的奶酪。这样也不错，有约翰逊先生这样的好伴侣关心你，还能看到其他女孩掀开窗帘注视着你和他一起走过。</td>
		<td class="en">Of course Mrs. O’Brien favoured the match as soon as Dry Valley’s intentions were disclosed.Being the mother of a woman child, and therefore a charter member of the Ancient Order of the Rat-trap, she joyfully decked out Panchita for the sacrifice.The girl was temporarily dazzled by having her dresses lengthened and her hair piled up on her head, and came near forgetting that she was only a slice of cheese.It was nice, too, to have as good a match as Mr. Johnson paying you attentions and to see the other girls fluttering the curtains at their windows to see you go by with him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“干谷”从圣安东尼奥买了一辆黄色轮子的马车和一匹好马。他每天载着潘吉达出去。他们散步或驾车的时候，从来没有人看到他对潘吉达说过话。他因衣着不自在而感到心慌；因没有风趣的谈吐而保持沉默；却因潘吉达坐在旁边的感觉而满心欢喜。</td>
		<td class="en">Dry Valley bought a buggy with yellow wheels and a fine trotter in San Antonio.Every day he drove out with Panchita.He was never seen to speak to her when they were walking or driving.The consciousness of his clothes kept his mind busy; the knowledge that he could say nothing of interest kept him dumb; the feeling that Panchita was there kept him happy.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他带着她去参加宴会和舞会，还去教堂。他努力着——噢，没有哪个男人曾像“干谷”这样努力地表现年轻。他不会跳舞；但是他发明了一种适合这些欢乐场合的笑容，这个笑容在他身上表示出的快乐和高兴，换做别人或许会用翻筋斗来表达了。他开始寻找镇上的年轻人——甚至孩子们作为伙伴。他们认为“干谷”显然是一个令人扫兴的人，因为他在玩的时候显得十分勉强，甚至去大教堂里玩都不过分。无论是他还是任何其他人都看不出他和潘吉达之间有什么进展。</td>
		<td class="en">He took her to parties and dances, and to church.He tried—oh, no man ever tried so hard to be young as Dry Valley did.He could not dance; but he invented a smile which he wore on these joyous occasions, a smile that, in him, was as great a concession to mirth and gaiety as turning hand-springs would be in another.He began to seek the company of the young men in the town—even of the boys.They accepted him as a decided damper, for his attempts at sportiveness were so forced that they might as well have essayed their games in a cathedral.Neither he nor any other could estimate what progress he had made with Panchita.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >突然一天，结局出现了，就像十一月的天上虚无缥缈的晚霞时常在风中消失那样的突兀。</td>
		<td class="en">The end came suddenly in one day, as often disappears the false afterglow before a November sky and wind.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“干谷”和那女孩约好了下午六点去散步。下午散步在圣罗莎是社交生活的一个特色，需要穿着讲究。因此，“干谷”开始漂亮地打扮自己；他开始得很早，因此很早就打扮好了，于是便走向奥布赖恩家。当他走进大门，沿着弯曲的小道走近门廊的时候，听到了屋里大声的嬉闹。他停下来，透过金银花藤向开着的房门看去。</td>
		<td class="en">Dry Valley was to call for the girl one afternoon at six for a walk.An afternoon walk in Santa Rosa was a feature of social life that called for the pink of one’s wardrobe.So Dry Valley began gorgeously to array himself; and so early that he finished early, and went over to the O’Brien cottage.As he neared the porch on the crooked walk from the gate he heard sounds of revelry within.He stopped and looked through the honeysuckle vines in the open door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >潘吉达在逗她的弟弟妹妹。她穿着男人的衣服——毫无疑问那是已去世的奥布赖恩先生的。她头上戴着最小那个弟弟的草帽，还有一条墨水画的条纹纸带当作帽带。手上拍打着黄色布手套，那是为了化妆舞会而草草裁制的。鞋子上也蒙着同样的材料，模仿着棕褐色的皮革。高耸的领子和飘拂的领带也没有漏掉。</td>
		<td class="en">Panchita was amusing her younger brothers and sisters.She wore a man’s clothes—no doubt those of the late Mr. O’Brien.On her head was the smallest brother’s straw hat decorated with an ink-striped paper band.On her hands were flapping yellow cloth gloves, roughly cut out and sewn for the masquerade.The same material covered her shoes, giving them the semblance of tan leather.High collar and flowing necktie were not omitted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >潘吉达就像一个女演员。“干谷”看到了自己假装年轻的姿态、因为右边鞋子夹脚而导致的蹒跚、勉强的笑容以及对英雄气概笨拙的模仿，都被活灵活现地重演了出来。第一次，他面前举起了一面镜子。其中的一个孩子喊道：“妈妈，来看潘吉达多像约翰逊先生！”这种证实其实是多余的。</td>
		<td class="en">Panchita was an actress.Dry Valley saw his affectedly youthful gait, his limp where the right shoe hurt him, his forced smile, his awkward simulation of a gallant air, all reproduced with startling fidelity.For the first time a mirror had been held up to him.The corroboration of one of the youngsters calling, “Mamma, come and see Pancha do like Mr. Johnson,” was not needed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >穿着那被嘲笑的棕褐色鞋，“干谷”尽可能轻地踮起脚尖悄悄穿过大门回家了。</td>
		<td class="en">As softly as the caricatured tans would permit, Dry Valley tiptoed back to the gate and home again.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在约定的散步时间过了二十分钟后，潘吉达戴着一顶单薄、整洁的白色细麻布水手帽端庄而轻快地走出大门。她漫步在人行道上，在“干谷”家门口放慢了脚步，她的举止表明，她对“干谷”这次少有的懈怠感到迷惑不解。</td>
		<td class="en">Twenty minutes after the time appointed for the walk Panchita tripped demurely out of her gate in a thin, trim white lawn and sailor hat.She strolled up the sidewalk and slowed her steps at Dry Valley’s gate, her manner expressing wonder at his unusual delinquency.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这时，走出家门、沿着小道大步走来的——不是那个错过了盛夏时光的五颜六色的受害者，而是那个恢复原样的牧羊人。他穿上了他的灰色旧羊毛衫，领子敞开着，棕色的帆布裤子塞在已经穿坏了的靴子里，白色墨西哥阔边毡帽戴在脑后。他看起来可能是二十岁也可能是五十岁；“干谷”不在乎了。他淡蓝色的眼睛碰上了潘吉达的黑眼睛，冷冷地闪着光。他一直走到大门口。他伸出他的长胳膊，指着她的家。</td>
		<td class="en">Then out of his door and down the walk strode—not the polychromatic victim of a lost summertime, but the sheepman, rehabilitated.He wore his old grey woolen shirt, open at the throat, his brown duck trousers stuffed into his run-over boots, and his white felt sombrero on the back of his head.Twenty years or fifty he might look; Dry Valley cared not.His light blue eyes met Panchita’s dark ones with a cold flash in them.He came as far as the gate.He pointed with his long arm to her house.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“回家去，”“干谷”说，“回家找你妈妈去。我真奇怪闪电竟没击中像我这样的傻瓜。回家玩沙子去吧。围在大人身边你都学到了什么？我想我一定是疯了,为了一个你这样的小孩把自己变成了一只雄鹦鹉。回家去，再也不要让我看到你。我为什么会那样做，谁能告诉我吗？回去，让我试着忘掉这件事吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Go home,” said Dry Valley.“Go home to your mother.I wonder lightnin’ don’t strike a fool like me.Go home and play in the sand.What business have you got cavortin’ around with grown men?I reckon I was locoed to be makin’ a he poll-parrot out of myself for a kid like you.Go home and don’t let me see you no more.Why I done it, will somebody tell me?Go home, and let me try and forget it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >潘吉达顺从地向她家慢慢走去，什么也没说。有一段路程，她不停地回头，大眼睛无畏地盯着“干谷”的眼睛。她在家门口站了一会儿，回头看着他，然后突然迅速地跑进屋里。</td>
		<td class="en">Panchita obeyed and walked slowly toward her home, saying nothing.For some distance she kept her head turned and her large eyes fixed intrepidly upon Dry Valley’s.At her gate she stood for a moment looking back at him, then ran suddenly and swiftly into the house.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >老安东尼娅正在厨房的炉子里生火。“干谷”站在门口，刺耳地笑了起来。</td>
		<td class="en">Old Antonia was building a fire in the kitchen stove.Dry Valley stopped at the door and laughed harshly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我就是一只挺好看的老犀牛，爱上了一个孩子，是不是，安东尼娅？”他说。</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m a pretty looking old rhinoceros to be gettin’ stuck on a kid, ain’t I, ’Tonia?” said he.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不是好事，”安东尼娅像个哲人似的表示赞同，“对于一个年纪太大的男人来说，爱上女孩子不是好事。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Not verree good thing,” agreed Antonia, sagely, “for too much old man to likee muchacha.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“当然不好，”“干谷”严肃地说，“这愚蠢至极，而且伤人至深。”</td>
		<td class="en">“You bet it ain’t,” said Dry Valley, grimly.“It’s dum foolishness; and, besides, it hurts.”</td></tr>
