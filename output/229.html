		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >清早，泰拉奇纳的旅馆里闹哄哄的。黎明时分，邮差就已启程去罗马了，但英国人还没出发。只要英国车马队伍一出发，就总能把旅馆弄得乱成一团。这回比平常还乱，英国人随身之物很多，他确信路上真的会有危险，向警方申请，花一大笔钱要了八个骑兵和十二个步兵，护送他到丰迪。也许，他实际上也想炫耀一下，不过说实在的，从他的言行举止中真没看出来。英国人像平常一样，沉默寡言、含蓄缄默，在一群目瞪口呆的人中走来走去。当他将很多晚上必不可少的便利用品打包时，他向约翰发出了简短的命令。英国人镇定自若地将几支手枪装上双倍子弹，放到马车的袋子里。但他完全没注意到，在一群闲逛的游手好闲的人中间，有一双敏锐的眼睛正在注视着他。</td>
		<td class="en">In the morning all was bustle in the inn at Terracina.The procaccio had departed at daybreak on its route towards Rome, but the Englishman was yet to start, and the departure of an English equipage is always enough to keep an inn in a bustle.On this occasion there was more than usual stir, for the Englishman, having much property about him, and having been convinced of the real danger of the road, had applied to the police, and obtained, by dint of liberal pay, an escort of eight dragoons and twelve foot soldiers, as far as Fondi.Perhaps, too, there might have been a little ostentation at bottom, though, to say the truth, he had nothing of it in his manner.He moved about, taciturn and reserved as usual, among the gaping crowd; gave laconic orders to John, as he packed away the thousand and one indispensable conveniences of the night; double loaded his pistols with great sang froid, and deposited them in the pockets of the carriage, taking no notice of a pair of keen eyes gazing on him from among the herd of loitering idlers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >此刻，一位漂亮的威尼斯妇人走上前来，用甜美的声音请求英国人，他的护送车队能护送他们的马车。英国人正忙着为他仆人装另两支手枪的子弹，用嘴咬着推弹杆。点了一下头表示同意，但自然连眼皮也没抬一下。这位漂亮的威尼斯妇人觉得英国人态度冷淡，有点儿生气。“噢，天啊！”离开时，她突然轻声说道，“这些英国人真是太冷漠了。”最后，他们声势浩大地出发了。八个骑兵昂首阔步地跑在最前面，十二个步兵垫后，马车在中间缓缓前行，确保步兵跟上他们的步伐。他们只走了几百码路，就发现落下了一件必不可少的东西。实际上，英国人的钱袋不见了，他派约翰回旅馆去找。这样因此耽误了一些时间，而威尼斯人的马车则继续缓缓前行。约翰气喘吁吁、垂头丧气地跑了回来。他没找到钱袋。他的主人火了，想起了放钱袋的地方，确信意大利仆人已经把钱袋放进口袋了。他叫约翰回去再找。约翰回来时还是没有找到钱袋，但身后紧跟着旅馆老板和他所有的家人和仆人。伴着各种怪异和扭曲的表情，他们突然大声喊叫，抗议道：“没看到钱袋，一定是阁下弄错了。”</td>
		<td class="en">The fair Venetian now came up with a request, made in her dulcet tones, that he would permit their carriage to proceed under protection of his escort.The Englishman, who was busy loading another pair of pistols for his servant, and held the ramrod between his teeth, nodded assent, as a matter of course, but without lifting up his eyes.The fair Venetian was a little piqued at what she supposed indifference; “ODio!” ejaculated she softly, as she retired, “quanta sono insensibili questi Inglesi.” At length, off they set in gallant style.The eight dragoons prancing in front, the twelve foot soldiers marching in rear, and the carriage moving slowly in the centre, to enable the infantry to keep pace with them.They had proceeded but a few hundred yards, when it was discovered that some indispensable article had been left behind.In fact, the Englishman’s purse was missing, and John was despatched to the inn to search for it.This occasioned a little delay, and the carriage of the Venetians drove slowly on.John came back out of breath and out of humour.The purse was not to be found.His master was irritated: he recollected the very place where it lay: he had not a doubt that the Italian servant had pocketed it.John was again sent back.He returned once more without the purse, but with the landlord and the whole household at his heels.A thousand ejaculations and protestations, accompanied by all sorts of grimaces and contortions—“No purse had been seen—his eccellenza must be mistaken.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不，阁下是不会弄错的。钱包就放在镜子下面的大理石桌上，是个绿袋子，装了半袋金子和银子。”又出现了许多怪异和扭曲的面孔，他们以圣热纳罗的名义发誓，根本没看到那样的钱袋。</td>
		<td class="en">“No—his eccellenza was not mistaken—the purse lay on the marble table, under the mirror, a green purse, half full of gold and silver.” Again a thousand grimaces and contortions, and vows by San Gennaro, that no purse of the kind had been seen.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >英国人怒不可遏。“是侍者将钱袋放进口袋里的，旅馆老板是无赖，旅馆是贼窝。这是一个邪恶的国家，我被骗了，到处遭人盗窃，但我不会善罢甘休，我要马上赶往警察局。”他正要命令左马驭者往回走，起身时动了下马车坐垫，钱袋哐当一声掉在了地上。他身上所有的血似乎都涌到了脸上，“该死的钱袋！”他一边说道，一边捡起钱袋。他抓起一把钱扔到脸色苍白、畏畏缩缩的侍者面前的地上，“好，开路！”他叫道，“约翰，命令左马驭者继续前行。”</td>
		<td class="en">The Englishman became furious.“The waiter had pocketed it—the landlord was a knave—the inn a den of thieves—it was a vile country—he had been cheated and plundered from one end of it to the other —but he’d have satisfaction—he’d drive right off to the police.” He was on the point of ordering the postilions to turn back, when, on rising, he displaced the cushion of the carriage, and the purse of money fell chinking to the floor.All the blood in his body seemed to rush into his face—“Curse the purse,” said he, as he snatched it up.He dashed a handful of money on the ground before the pale cringing waiter—“There—be off!” cried he.“John, order the postilions to drive on.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这场争执大约耗了半个多小时。威尼斯人的马车在前面晃晃悠悠地走着，车上的旅客不时探头张望，期望着护送队伍随时跟上他们。他们渐渐转过一个弯，消失在人们的视线中。这支小队伍又开始行进了，当他们沿着岩石蜿蜒前行时，晨光正好照在士兵们的枪支上，闪闪发亮，呈现出一幅生动的景象。</td>
		<td class="en">Above half an hour had been exhausted in this altercation.The Venetian carriage had loitered along; its passengers looking out from time to time, and expecting the escort every moment to follow.They had gradually turned an angle of the road that shut them out of sight.The little army was again in motion, and made a very picturesque appearance as it wound along at the bottom of the rocks; the morning sunshine beaming upon the weapons of the soldiery.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >英国人懒洋洋地依靠在马车里，还在为刚才的事情恼火，因此对整个世界都感到不满。其实，这种事对以旅游为乐的先生们来说，太平常不过，几乎不值一提。他们顺着山中的斜坡向上前行，走到了前方可能存在一些危险的地段。</td>
		<td class="en">The Englishman lolled back in his carriage, vexed with himself at what had passed, and consequently out of humour with all the world.As this, however, is no uncommon case with gentlemen who travel for their pleasure, it is hardly worthy of remark.They had wound up from the coast among the hills, and came to a part of the road that admitted of some prospect ahead.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“看不到威尼斯女士的马车了，先生。”约翰从马车座位上探身说道。“呸！”英国人烦躁地说道，“别拿女士的马车来烦我，难道我就应该不停地为那些陌生人的事烦恼吗？”约翰没敢再说一个字，因为他很了解主人的脾气。</td>
		<td class="en">“I see nothing of the lady’s carriage, sir,” said John, leaning down from the coach-box.—“Pish!” said the Englishman, testily—“don’t plague me about the lady’s carriage; must I be continually pestered with the concerns of strangers?” John said not another word, for he understood his master’s mood.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >道路愈发荒凉，人迹罕至。他们缓缓前行，向山上爬。骑兵们走得稍前一些，刚到山顶，他们就惊呼起来，确切地说是大声喊叫起来，然后策马向前奔去。英国人从闷闷不乐的沉思中惊醒过来。他将头探出马车时，马车已到了悬崖边缘。在他前面延伸的是一条长长的凹行峡谷，峡谷的一边崎岖陡峭的高地，覆盖着灌木丛和稀疏的树林。不远处，他看见的威尼斯人的马车被掀翻了，一大帮暴徒正在搜劫马车。那个年轻人和仆人已被制服，还被剥去部分衣服，妇人也落入两个恶棍手中。不远处，他看见的威尼斯人的马车被掀翻了，一大帮暴徒正在搜劫马车。那个年轻人和仆人已被制服，还被剥去部分衣服，妇人也落入两个恶棍手中。</td>
		<td class="en">The road grew more wild and lonely; they were slowly proceeding on a foot pace up a hill; the dragoons were some distance ahead, and had just reached the summit of the hill, when they uttered an exclamation, or rather shout, and galloped forward.The Englishman was roused from his sulky reverie.He stretched his head from the carriage, which had attained the brow of the hill.Before him extended a long hollow defile, commanded on one side by rugged precipitous heights, covered with bushes and scanty forests.At some distance he beheld the carriage of the Venetians overturned; a numerous gang of desperadoes were rifling it; the young man and his servant were overpowered, and partly stripped, and the lady was in the hands of two of the ruffians.The Englishman seized his pistols, sprang from the carriage, and called upon John to follow him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就在骑兵们冲上去的时候，正忙着洗劫马车的强盗们丢下掠夺品，在马路中间摆起架势，不慌不忙地瞄准开火。</td>
		<td class="en">In the mean time, as the dragoons came forward, the robbers, who were busy with the carriage, quitted their spoil, formed themselves in the middle of the road, and, taking a deliberate aim, fired.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一个骑兵倒下了，另一个也受伤了，整个部队一时间突然停住，乱成一团。强盗们马上又装起货来。骑兵们用卡宾枪射击，但却没有明显效果。他们又遭到一轮袭子弹齐射，尽管没人倒下，却让他们又陷入了混乱。强盗们再一次装起掠夺品，就在此时，他们看见步兵即将赶到。强盗们叫道：“撤退！”他们丢下掠夺品，撤退到了岩石上，众士兵紧追不舍。他们从悬崖打到悬崖，从灌木丛打到灌木丛。强盗们时不时转身，向追击他们的士兵开枪，士兵们跟着他们向上攀爬，一有机会就开步枪回击。有时，一个士兵或者一个强盗被击倒了，摔下悬崖去。强盗只要一露脸，士兵就从下向上射击。</td>
		<td class="en">One of the dragoons fell, another was wounded, and the whole were for a moment checked and thrown in confusion.The robbers loaded again in an instant.The dragoons discharged their carbines, but without apparent effect.They received another volley, which, though none fell, threw them again into confusion.The robbers were loading a second time, when they saw the foot soldiers at hand.—“Scampa via!” was the word: they abandoned their prey, and retreated up the rocks, the soldiers after them.They fought from cliff to cliff, and bush to bush, the robbers turning every now and then, to fire upon their pursuers; the soldiers scrambling after them, and discharging their muskets whenever they could get a chance.Sometimes a soldier or a robber was shot down, and came tumbling among the cliffs.The dragoons kept firing from below, whenever a robber came in sight.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >英国人匆忙赶到战场，当他向前狂跑时，射向士兵们的子弹从他身边嗖嗖飞过。即使如此，还是有一件事引起了他的注意。那就是落入两个强盗手里的那位漂亮的威尼斯夫人，混战中尖叫着被那两个强盗向山上拖去。他看到她的衣服在灌木丛中闪现不定，于是他跳上岩石去阻挡强盗偷偷带走他们的“胜利品”。陡峭的悬崖和缠绕的灌木耽搁和阻碍他的前进。虽然他看不见夫人，但仍能听见她渐弱的哭喊声，于是寻声追赶。他们带着夫人逃向左边，但枪声表明激战却在右边。最后，英国人追到岩石溪谷中一条被踩出的崎岖小路上，发现不远处，强盗正拖着夫人匆忙地向峡谷里逃窜。一个强盗听他走近，放开夫人就朝他奔来，端起挂在背上的卡宾枪向他开火。子弹从英国人的帽子上飕地飞过，扫走了他的几根头发。他用一支手枪还击，强盗被射倒了。另一个强盗也放下夫人，从腰带上拔出一把长手枪，不慌不忙地朝他开火。子弹从英国人的左臂下穿过，稍稍擦伤了皮。英国人冲上前去，拿起另一只手枪反击，击伤了强盗，但强盗伤得并不重。</td>
		<td class="en">The Englishman had hastened to the scene of action, and the balls discharged at the dragoons had whistled past him as he advanced.One object, however, engrossed his attention.It was the beautiful Venetian lady in the hands of two of the robbers, who, during the confusion of the fight, carried her shrieking up the mountain.He saw her dress gleaming among the bushes, and he sprang up the rocks to intercept the robbers as they bore off their prey.The ruggedness of the steep, and the entanglements of the bushes, delayed and impeded him.He lost sight of the lady, but was still guided by her cries, which grew fainter and fainter.They were off to the left, while the reports of muskets showed that the battle was raging to the right.At length he came upon what appeared to be a rugged footpath, faintly worn in a gully of the rocks, and beheld the ruffians at some distance hurrying the lady up the defile.One of them, hearing his approach, let go his prey, advanced towards him, and levelling the carbine, which had been slung’ on his back, fired.The ball whizzed through the Englishman’s hat, and carried with it some of his hair.He returned the fire with one of his pistols, and the robber fell.The other brigand now dropped the lady, and drawing a long pistol from his belt, fired on his adversary with deliberate aim.The ball passed between his left arm and his side, slightly wounding the arm.The Englishman advanced, and discharged his remaining pistol, which wounded the robber, but not severely.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >强盗拔出一把匕首，扑向英国人，英国人闪躲过去，受了点儿轻伤，然后拿起带弹簧刀的手枪进行防卫。他们相互逼近，展开了生死搏斗。强盗长得矮矮墩墩、满面胡须、强壮有力、身手灵活。英国人尽管个子高大、健壮有力，但不太灵活，也不习惯跑动搏斗，不过防守技术倒很老练。他们在一个险峭的山顶上搏斗，英国人感到强盗正奋力将他逼向悬崖边。英国人斜眼一瞥，发现刚才被打伤的那个强盗，正手握匕首，向山上爬来援助他的同伙。确实，强盗已爬到了崖顶，离他只有几步之遥，英国人觉得这下完了。就在此时，突然一声枪响，强盗被打死了。这一枪是约翰开的，多亏他及时赶到，救了主人一命。</td>
		<td class="en">The brigand drew a stiletto and rushed upon his adversary, who eluded the blow, receiving merely a slight wound, and defended himself with his pistol, which had a spring bayonet.They closed with one another, and a desperate struggle ensued.The robber was a square-built, thick-set man, powerful, muscular, and active.The Englishman, though of larger frame and greater strength, was less active and less accustomed to athletic exercises and feats of hardihood, but he showed himself practised and skilled in the arts of defence.They were on a craggy height, and the Englishman perceived that his antagonist was striving to press him to the edge.A side-glance showed him also the robber whom he had first wounded, scrambling up to the assistance of his comrade, stiletto in hand.He had in fact attained the summit of the cliff, he was within a few steps, and the Englishman felt that his case was desperate, when he heard suddenly the report of a pistol, and the ruffian fell.The shot came from John, who had arrived just in time to save his master.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >剩下的那个强盗，由于打斗激烈、流血过多，已精疲力竭、摇晃不稳。英国人趁机追上，朝强盗逼去，待他浑身无力，猛地一推让他一头栽下了悬崖。英国人上前一看，强盗一动不动地躺在山下的岩石间。</td>
		<td class="en">The remaining robber, exhausted by loss of blood and the violence of the contest, showed signs of faltering.The Englishman pursued his advantage, pressed on him, and, as his strength relaxed, dashed him headlong from the precipice.He looked after him, and saw him lying motionless among the rocks below.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >英国人马上开始寻找美丽的威尼斯夫人。他发现她躺在地上，昏迷不醒。在仆人的帮助下，英国人将夫人背到大路上，她的丈夫正那里像个疯子一样大喊大叫。夫人的丈夫一直没找到夫人，以为她失踪了。当他看到英国人把夫人安全带回来的时候，欣喜若狂，完全无法控制内心的喜悦。要不是英国人及时阻拦，他会把失去知觉的夫人一把搂在怀里。此时英国人的内心真正被唤醒了，表现出的真切温柔和侠肝义胆，让看惯了他一贯的冷漠的人甚感意外。但不管怎样，他的善良让人感到真实，绝不虚夸。</td>
		<td class="en">The Englishman now sought the fair Venetian.He found her senseless on the ground.With his servant’s assistance he bore her down to the road, where her husband was raving like one distracted.He had sought her in vain, and had given her over for lost; and when he beheld her thus brought back in safety, his joy was equally wild and ungovernable.He would have caught her insensible form to his bosom had not the Englishman restrained him.The latter, now really aroused, displayed a true tenderness and manly gallantry, which one would not have expected from his habitual phlegm.His kindness, however, was practical, not wasted in words.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他派约翰去马车里取来各种营养品，完全没在意自己，只担心可爱美丽的夫人。山上零星的枪声表明强盗们在边打边撤。夫人有了苏醒迹象。英国人一心只想着让夫人离开这个危险的地方，于是将她转移到自己的马车上，交给她丈夫照顾，命令骑兵将他们护送到丰迪。威尼斯人坚持让英国人一起上马车，但英国人拒绝了。威尼斯人千恩万谢，感激涕零，但英国人只是摆手让车夫上路。</td>
		<td class="en">He despatched John to the carriage for restoratives of all kinds, and, totally thoughtless of himself, was anxious only about his lovely charge.The occasional discharge of 6re-arms along the height, showed that a retreating fight was still kept up by the robbers.The lady gave signs of reviving animation.The Englishman, eager to get her from this place of danger, conveyed her to his own carriage, and committing her to the care of her husband, ordered the dragoons to escort them to Fondi.The Venetian would have insisted on the Englishman’s getting into the carriage, but the latter refused.He poured forth a torrent of thanks and benedictions; but the Englishman beckoned to the postilions to drive on.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >约翰包扎好了主人的伤口，尽管由于流血过多而感到浑身无力，但好在伤势并不严重。他们整理好威尼斯人的马车，安置好行李后，登上马车，启程赶往丰迪。士兵们还在继续搜索强盗。</td>
		<td class="en">John now dressed his master’s wounds, which were found not to be serious, though he was faint with loss of blood.The Venetian carriage had been righted, and the baggage replaced; and, getting into it, they set out on their way towards Fondi, leaving the foot soldiers still engaged in ferreting out the banditti.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >车还没到丰迪，漂亮的威尼斯夫人就已完全苏醒了。她问了几个习惯性的问题：“我在哪儿？”“在英国人的马车上。”“我是怎么从强盗那脱险的？”“是英国人救了你。”</td>
		<td class="en">Before arriving at Fondi, the fair Venetian had completely recovered from her swoon.She made the usual question—“Where was she?”—“In the Englishman’s carriage.”—“How had she escaped from the robbers?”—“The Englishman had rescued her.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她感动得不得了，一次次激动地大叫，千恩万谢她的救命恩人。她无数次地责备自己，把英国人看成了冷漠无情的人。一见到英国人，她便按照自己的民族习惯，热情地扑进了他的怀里，双手搂住他的脖子，激动得说不出话来。还没有哪个男人会让一个漂亮女人的拥抱搞得如此狼狈。</td>
		<td class="en">Her transports were unbounded; and mingled with them were enthusiastic ejaculations of gratitude to her deliverer.A thousand times did she reproach herself for having accused him of coldness and insensibility.The moment she saw him she rushed into his arms with the vivacity of her nation, and hung about his neck in a speechless transport of gratitude.Never was man more embarrassed by the embraces of a fine woman.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嘘！嘘！”英国人说道。“你受伤了！”看到衣服上的血迹，威尼斯夫人尖叫起来。“噢！没关系！”“我的救命恩人啊！我的天使！”她又紧搂住他的脖子，在他怀里抽泣。“嘘！”英国人开心地说着，不过看上去有点儿可笑，“这没什么。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Tut—tut!” said the Englishman.—“You are wounded!” shrieked the fair Venetian, as she saw blood upon his clothes.—“Pooh! nothing at all!”—“My deliverer!—my angel!” exclaimed she, clasping him again round the neck, and sobbing on his bosom.—“Pish!” said the Englishman, with a good-humoured tone, but looking somewhat foolish, “this is all humbug.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过从那以后，漂亮的威尼斯夫人再也不指责英国人冷漠无情了。</td>
		<td class="en">The fair Venetian, however, has never since accused the English of insensibility.</td></tr>
