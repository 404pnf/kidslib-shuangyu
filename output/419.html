		<td class="en">He then helped the frightened and half-fainting girl into the large cool verandah where her parents were sitting, and from that hour he was a welcome guest in the house, and it was not long before he was the promised husband of Julia.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >每天，工作结束后，他就常去她家里。房子半掩在鲜花盛开的植物与鲜艳的藤蔓中，蜂鸟在树丛中飞来飞去，各种颜色的鹦鹉，红的、绿的和灰的，也尖声合唱着。</td>
		<td class="en">Every day, when his work was done, he used to go up to the house, half hidden among flowering plants and brilliant creepers, where humming-birds darted from bush to bush, and parrots of all colours, red and green and grey, shrieked in chorus.</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我正要扎最后一个猛子的时候，听到了——有时从这边，有时从那边——一阵歌声，这唱歌的声音比任何一只夜莺的歌声都甜美，尽管我没能听清楚任何一个词。</td>
		<td class="en">I was taking my last plunge, when I heard—sometimes from one side, and sometimes from another—the sound of a voice singing more sweetly than any nightingale, though I could not catch any words.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我赶紧穿上衣服，离开水塘，我找遍了水塘附近的每个灌木丛和每棵树，因为我猜想或许这是我的朋友在和我开玩笑，但我连一只动物都没看到。而且回到家后，我发现我的朋友都睡得正香。”</td>
		<td class="en">I left the pool, and, dressing myself as fast as I could, I searched every bush and tree round the water, as I fancied that perhaps it was my friend who was playing a trick on me, but there was not a creature to be seen; and when I reached home I found my friend fast asleep.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >听到他的故事，茱莉娅的脸色变得惨白，她好像很冷，整个身体一直在发抖。</td>
		<td class="en">As Julia listened her face grew deadly white, and her whole body shivered as if with cold.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从童年时代起，她就听过关于可怕怪物的故事，怪物们住在森林里，藏在河岸下，只有法力无边的护身符才能驱赶他们。</td>
		<td class="en">From her childhood she had heard stories of the terrible beings that lived in the forests and were hidden under the banks of the rivers, and could only be kept off by powerful charms.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那蛊惑阿朗佐的声音会是来自其中的一个怪物吗？</td>
		<td class="en">Could the voice which had bewitched Alonzo have come from one of these?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >或许，谁知道呢，那可能就是令人恐惧的亚拉本人的声音，她在年轻人结婚的前夜来寻找他们作为猎物。</td>
		<td class="en">Perhaps, who knows, it might be the voice of the dreaded Yara herself, who sought young men on the eve of their marriage as her prey.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >女孩坐在那里，这些念头在她脑海里匆匆闪过，好一会儿都害怕得说不出话来。然后，她说道：“阿朗佐，你能答应我件事吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">For a moment the girl sat choked with fear, as these thoughts rushed through her; then she said: ‘Alonzo, will you promise something?’</td></tr>

		<td class="en">‘Oh! it is serious, then?</td></tr>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想要你答应我，”她回答道，压低了声音悄悄说，“再别去那些水塘游泳了。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘I want you to promise,’ she answered, lowering her voice to a whisper, ‘never to bathe in those pools again.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但为什么不能呢，我灵魂的女王？我不是一直都去那儿的吗？还没有东西伤害过我呀，我心中的花朵。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘But why not, queen of my soul; have I not gone there always, and nothing has harmed me, flower of my heart?’</td></tr>

		<td class="en">Tell me why you are so frightened?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你难道没听到歌声吗？”她问道，身体颤抖着。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Did you not hear the song?’ she asked, trembling.</td></tr>

		<td class="en">‘Suppose I did, how could that hurt me?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那是我听过的最美妙的歌声了！”</td>
		<td class="en">It was the loveliest song I ever heard!’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是的，歌声过后，妖怪就来了，再后来——再后来——”</td>

		<td class="en">Had she really gone mad?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这样的话一点儿都不像朱莉娅说的。但他还没醒过神来，女孩又说话了：</td>
		<td class="en">Such talk was very unlike Julia; but before he could collect his senses the girl spoke again:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那就是我恳求你别再去那儿的原因。无论如何，等到我们结婚后你再去那儿吧。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘That is the reason why I implore you never to go there again; at any rate till after we are married.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我们的婚姻对这件事有什么影响吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘And what difference will our marriage make?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，那时候就不会有危险了，你可以想去洗几次就去几次。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Oh, there will be no danger then; you can go to bathe as often as you like!’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“但是，告诉我为什么你这么害怕？”</td>
		<td class="en">‘But tell me why you are so afraid?’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“因为你听到的声音——我知道你会笑我，但那的确是真的——那是亚拉的声音。”</td>
		<td class="en">‘Because the voice you heard—I know you will laugh, but it is quite true—it was the voice of the Yara.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >听到这些话，阿朗佐大笑了起来，但他的笑声非常刺耳、大声，听得朱莉娅颤抖着缩到了一边。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >看起来他笑得停不下来了，而且他笑得越厉害，女孩的脸就越苍白，她一边注视着他，一边喃喃自语道：</td>
		<td class="en">It seemed as if he could not stop himself, and the more he laughed the paler the poor girl became, murmuring to herself as she watched him:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，老天！你看到她了！你看到她了！我该怎么办呢？”</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >尽管她的话非常微弱，但还是被阿朗佐听到了，因为还在笑的缘故，他没法说话，就摇了摇头。</td>
		<td class="en">Faint as was her whisper, it reached the ears of Alonzo, who, though he still could not speak for laughing, shook his head.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你也许不知道，但它是真的。</td>
		<td class="en">‘You may not know it, but it is true.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >没有见过亚拉的人是不会笑成那样的。”</td>
		<td class="en">Nobody who has not seen the Yara laughs like that.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >朱莉娅扑倒在地，伤心地哭着。</td>
		<td class="en"> And Julia flung herself on the ground weeping bitterly.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >看到这一幕，阿朗佐突然变得严肃起来，他跪在她身边，温柔地把她扶起来。</td>
		<td class="en">At this sight Alonzo became suddenly grave, and kneeling by her side, gently raised her up.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“不要这样哭了，我的天使，”他说，“只要你高兴，我什么事都答应你。</td>
		<td class="en">‘Do not cry so, my angel,’ he said, ‘I will promise anything you please.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >只要让我再看到你的笑容。”</td>
		<td class="en">Only let me see you smile again.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >朱莉娅好不容易止住了抽泣，站起身来。</td>
		<td class="en">With a great effort Julia checked her sobs, and rose to her feet.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“谢谢你，”她回答道，</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你那样说，我心里舒服多了！</td>
		<td class="en">‘My heart grows lighter as you say that!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我知道你会尽力信守承诺，远离那个森林的。</td>
		<td class="en">I know you will try to keep your word and to stay away from the forest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是——亚拉的法力非常强大，她的声音很容易让男人忘记世上一切其他的东西。</td>
		<td class="en">But—the power of the Yara is very strong, and the sound of her voice is apt to make men forget everything else in the world.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >哦，我看到过的，不止一个订过婚的少女带着破碎的心独自生活。</td>
		<td class="en">Oh, I have seen it, and more than one betrothed maiden lives alone, broken-hearted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >如果你再去那个你第一次听到歌声的水塘，答应我，你至少要把这个带在身上。”</td>
		<td class="en">If ever you should return to the pool where you first heard the voice, promise me that you will at least take this with you.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她打开了一个有着奇特雕刻的盒子，从中拿出一个多彩的贝壳，对着它轻轻地唱了一首歌。</td>
		<td class="en"> And opening a curiously carved box, she took out a sea-shell shot with many colours, and sang a song softly into it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你一听到亚拉的声音，”她说，“就把这个放到你的耳边，这样你就会改听到我的歌声了。</td>
		<td class="en">‘The moment you hear the Yara’s voice,’ said she, ‘put this to your ear, and you will hear my song instead.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >或许——我不敢肯定——但也许，我可能比亚拉更强大。”</td>
		<td class="en">Perhaps—I do not know for certain—but perhaps, I may be stronger than the Yara.’</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >阿朗佐回到家时已经是深夜了。</td>
		<td class="en">It was late that night when Alonzo returned home.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >月亮照着远处的河流，看上去凉爽诱人，森林中的树木好像在伸出双臂，召唤他走近些。</td>
		<td class="en">The moon was shining on the distant river, which looked cool and inviting, and the trees of the forest seemed to stretch out their arms and beckon him near.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但小伙子坚定地把脸转向另外的方向，回家上床睡觉了。</td>
		<td class="en">But the young man steadily turned his face in the other direction, and went home to bed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这种挣扎非常艰难，但阿朗佐第二天就得到了回报，朱莉娅喜悦又欣慰地迎接了他。</td>
		<td class="en">The struggle had been hard, but Alonzo had his reward next day in the joy and relief with which Julia greeted him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他向她保证，既然他已经抵挡住了第一次诱惑，那么危险就过去了。但朱莉娅比他更清楚亚拉面孔和声音的魔力，在他离开时，她还不忘让他重复一遍他的诺言。</td>
		<td class="en">He assured her that having overcome the temptation once the danger was now over; but she, knowing better than he did the magic of the Yara’s face and voice, did not fail to make him repeat his promise when he went away.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >接连三个晚上，阿朗佐都恪守承诺，这并不是因为他相信亚拉的存在，他觉得有关亚拉的故事全是一派胡言，而是因为他不忍心看到，如果他承认自己去过森林，朱莉娅见他的时候就会眼泪汪汪的。</td>
		<td class="en">For three nights Alonzo kept his word, not because he believed in the Yara, for he thought that the tales about her were all nonsense, but because he could not bear the tears with which he knew that Julia would greet him, if he confessed that he had returned to the forest.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，尽管如此，歌声还是在他耳边响起，而且声音一天比一天大。</td>
		<td class="en">But, in spite of this, the song rang in his ears, and daily grew louder.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第四个晚上，森林的吸引力变得非常强大，不论是想到朱莉娅还是他的诺言都无法阻止他。</td>
		<td class="en">On the fourth night the attraction of the forest grew so strong that neither the thought of Julia nor the promises he had made her could hold him back.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >十一点钟的时候，他冲进了阴凉漆黑的树林，踏上了径直通向河边的小路。</td>
		<td class="en">At eleven o’clock he plunged into the cool darkness of the trees, and took the path that led straight to the river.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是，他第一次发现，尽管朱莉娅警告他时他还嘲笑过她，但现在她的警告仍留在他脑海中。他的目光扫过灌木丛时，心里感到有些害怕，而这种感觉以前从未有过。</td>
		<td class="en">Yet, for the first time, he found that Julia’s warnings, though he had laughed at her at the moment, had remained in his memory, and he glanced at the bushes with a certain sense of fear which was quite new to him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >来到河边后，他停下来向四周看了看，确信那种有人在注视他的奇怪感觉只是他的幻想，他的确是独自一人。</td>
		<td class="en">When he reached the river he paused and looked round for a moment to make sure that the strange feeling of some one watching him was fancy, and he was really alone.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但皎洁的月光照在每棵树上，除了他自己的影子，再也看不到别的东西；除了潺潺的水声，再也听不到别的声音。</td>
		<td class="en">But the moon shone brightly on every tree, and nothing was to be seen but his own shadow; nothing was to be heard but the sound of the rippling stream.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他扔掉衣服，正要一头扎进河里时，忽然有什么东西——他不知道是什么——促使他向四周张望。</td>
		<td class="en">He threw off his clothes, and was just about to dive in headlong, when something—he did not know what—suddenly caused him to look round.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >就在这时，月亮从一片云彩后经过，月光落在一个美丽的金发女子身上，她正半掩着自己站在蕨草中。</td>
		<td class="en">At the same instant the moon passed from behind a cloud, and its rays fell on a beautiful golden-haired woman standing half hidden by the ferns.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他一下子跳起来，抓起他的披风，一头冲回他来时的路，每走一步都害怕会有只手放在他肩上。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >直到他把最后一棵树抛在身后，站在了开阔的平原上，他才敢向四周看看。而他仍觉得有个身穿白衣的身影站在那里不停地来回挥着胳膊。</td>
		<td class="en">It was not till he had left the last trees behind him, and was standing in the open plain, that he dared to look round, and then he thought a figure in white was still standing there waving her arms to and fro.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这真是够受了。他比平时更拼命地沿路狂奔，直到跑进自己的房间才停下来。</td>
		<td class="en">This was enough; he ran along the road harder than ever, and never paused till he was save in his own room.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >迎着拂晓的第一缕曙光，他回到森林想看看能不能找到亚拉的任何踪迹。但尽管他找遍了每一堆灌木丛，查看了每一棵树，四周还是空荡荡的。他唯一听到的声音就是鹦鹉的叫声，这难听的声音只会把人赶跑。</td>
		<td class="en">With the earliest rays of dawn he went back to the forest to see whether he could find any traces of the Yara, but though he searched every clump of bushes, and looked up every tree, everything was empty, and the only voices he heard were those of parrots, which are so ugly that they only drive people away.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我想我一定是疯了，”他自言自语道，“竟然梦到了这些荒唐的事。”回到城里，他又开始做自己的日常工作。</td>
		<td class="en">‘I think I must be mad,’ he said to himself, ‘and have dreamt all that folly’; and going back to the city he began his daily work.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是，工作要么比平时难做，要么就是他生病了，因为他不能集中精力。一整天，他碰到的每个人都问他发生了什么事情，让他的脸色那么苍白可怕。</td>
		<td class="en">But either that was harder than usual, or he must be ill, for he could not fix his mind upon it, and everybody he came across during the day inquired if anything had happened to give him that white, frightened look.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我一定是发烧了，”他自言自语地说，“毕竟，一个人烧得这么厉害的时候去洗冷水澡是非常危险的。”</td>
