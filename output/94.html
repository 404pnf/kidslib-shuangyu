		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这样的故事里当然少不了国王和王后。国王是一位可怕的老人，身上佩戴着数把六发式左轮手枪，靴子上装有马刺，他叫喊起来声音特别洪亮，连大草原上的响尾蛇听到了，都会吓得直往仙人掌下的洞里钻。在他未建立皇室之前，人们叫他“轻言细语的本”。当他拥有了五万英亩的土地和数不清的牛群后，人们便称他为“牛国王”奥唐奈。</td>
		<td class="en">There had to be a king and queen, of course.The king was a terrible old man who wore six-shooters and spurs, and shouted in such a tremendous voice that the rattlers on the prairie would run into their holes under the prickly pear.Before there was a royal family they called the man “Whispering Ben.”When he came to own 50,000 acres of land and more cattle than he could count, they called him O’Donnell “the Cattle King.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >王后是一位来自拉雷多的墨西哥女孩。后来，她成为了一位善良温柔、科罗拉多式的妻子，甚至成功地说服了本，让他在屋内尽量压低嗓门，以免震坏碗盘。本登上王位的前期，她总会坐在埃斯皮诺萨牧场的回廊上编织草席。财富源源不断地涌来，这巨大的诱惑令人难以抗拒，于是，她命人用马车从圣安东尼买来了软垫椅子和一张大圆桌。此后，她却低下了那光滑乌黑的头颅，遭遇了与达那厄相同的不幸命运。</td>
		<td class="en">The queen had been a Mexican girl from Laredo.She made a good, mild, Colorado-claro wife, and even succeeded in teaching Ben to modify his voice sufficiently while in the house to keep the dishes from being broken.When Ben got to be king she would sit on the gallery of Espinosa Ranch and weave rush mats.When wealth became so irresistible and oppressive that upholstered chairs and a centre table were brought down from San Antone in the wagons, she bowed her smooth, dark head, and shared the fate of the Danae.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >为了避免欺君罪，我先向你们介绍了国王和王后。他们不是这个故事的主人公，其实这个故事可以叫做“公主纪事、奇思妙想和搞破坏的狮子”。</td>

		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >约瑟法·奥唐奈是他们仅存的女儿，即公主。她如她母亲一样，天性热情，皮肤微黑，有着独特的亚热带人的美貌。从本·奥唐奈国王那里，她获得了英勇胆识、常识和统治才能。这种各因素综合在一起的人物，值得你跑数英里路来拜访。约瑟法骑在她的小马上疾驰时，瞄准一个在绳子末端摇摆着的番茄酱罐子打枪，六枪便有五枪会中。她可以和自己的小白猫玩上好几小时，并给它穿上各种各样古怪的衣服。她用不着动笔，就可以凭心算告诉你，1545头两岁的小牛按每头8.5美元的价格算，总共可以卖多少钱。大致上讲，埃斯皮诺萨牧场长40英里，宽30英里——不过大部分是租来的土地。约瑟法骑着她的小马，已勘探过了这片牧场的每一英里土地。牧场上的每一个牧童都能一眼认出她，他们都是她忠实的仆役。里普利·吉文斯是埃斯皮诺萨牧场上一个牧牛队的领班，有一天，他看到了约瑟法，便下定决心要和皇家联姻。他这是自以为是吗？倒也不是。那个时候，在努埃西斯村，男人个个都是男子汉。并且，牛国王的头衔并不代表皇族血统。这一王冠通常仅表明，它的主人有着高明的偷牛术。</td>
		<td class="en">Josefa O’Donnell was the surviving daughter, the princess.From her mother she inherited warmth of nature and a dusky, semi-tropic beauty.From Ben O’Donnell the royal she acquired a store of intrepidity, common sense, and the faculty of ruling.The combination was one worth going miles to see.Josefa while riding her pony at a gallop could put five out of six bullets through a tomato-can swinging at the end of a string.She could play for hours with a white kitten she owned, dressing it in all manner of absurd clothes.Scorning a pencil, she could tell you out of her head what 1545 two-year-olds would bring on the hoof, at $8.50 per head.Roughly speaking, the Espinosa Ranch is forty miles long and thirty broad—but mostly leased land.Josefa, on her pony, had prospected over every mile of it.Every cow-puncher on the range knew her by sight and was a loyal vassal.Ripley Givens, foreman of one of the Espinosa outfits, saw her one day, and made up his mind to form a royal matrimonial alliance.Presumptuous?No.In those days in the Nueces country a man was a man.And, after all, the title of cattle king does not presuppose blood royalty.Often it only signifies that its owner wears the crown in token of his magnificent qualities in the art of cattle stealing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天，里普利·吉文斯骑马到双榆树牧场，去打听一群走失的牛犊的下落。他很晚才踏上归途，太阳落山时，他来到了努埃西斯河的白马渡口。从那儿到他自己的营地有16英里远。到埃斯皮诺萨牧场有12英里远。吉文斯累了。所以他决定在渡口过夜。</td>
		<td class="en">One day Ripley Givens rode over to the Double Elm Ranch to inquire about a bunch of strayed yearlings.He was late in setting out on his return trip, and it was sundown when he struck the White Horse Crossing of the Nueces.From there to his own camp it was sixteen miles.To the Espinosa ranch it was twelve.Givens was tired.He decided to pass the night at the Crossing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >河床上有一处水坑，里边的水很清澈。河岸两边长满了茂密的大树和灌木。水坑后面五十码处有一片卷曲的格兰马草地——正好可以用作马儿的夜宵和他自己的床铺。吉文斯把马栓在树桩上，铺开鞍毯，把它晾干。他靠着一棵树坐了下来，卷了一支纸烟。突然，从河流边密林里的某个地方，传来了一声怒不可遏、令人发颤的哀嚎。拴着的小马扑腾了起来，喷出一串口哨似的鼻息声，夹杂着恐惧。吉文斯呼出团团烟圈，但他从容地把草地上的手枪带拿了过来，试着转了转弹膛。一只大雀鳝扑哧一声跃入了水坑。一只小灰兔跳过一堆猫爪草，坐下了来，撕扯着自己的胡须，滑稽地望着吉文斯。马儿继续吃着草。</td>
		<td class="en">There was a fine water hole in the river-bed.The banks were thickly covered with great trees, undergrown with brush.Back from the water hole fifty yards was a stretch of curly mesquite grass—supper for his horse and bed for himself.Givens staked his horse, and spread out his saddle blankets to dry.He sat down with his back against a tree and rolled a cigarette.From somewhere in the dense timber along the river came a sudden, rageful, shivering wail.The pony danced at the end of his rope and blew a whistling snort of comprehending fear.Givens puffed at his cigarette, but he reached leisurely for his pistol-belt, which lay on the grass, and twirled the cylinder of his weapon tentatively.A great gar plunged with a loud splash into the water hole.A little brown rabbit skipped around a bunch of catclaw and sat twitching his whiskers and looking humorously at Givens.The pony went on eating grass.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在日落时分，当一只墨西哥狮子沿着小河高声歌唱时，提高警惕也是很正常的。它唱歌的主题可能是：小牛和肥羊不多了，在食肉欲望的驱使下，它想跟你认识认识。</td>
		<td class="en">It is well to be reasonably watchful when a Mexican lion sings soprano along the arroyos at sundown.The burden of his song may be that young calves and fat lambs are scarce, and that he has a carnivorous desire for your acquaintance.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >草地上躺着一个空水果罐头，是之前某个路人扔在那儿的。吉文斯看到了这个罐头瓶，便心满意足地咕哝了起来。他那系在马鞍后面的衣袋里，有一两把碾碎的咖啡豆。黑咖啡和纸烟！牧场主还会期望别的什么吗？</td>
		<td class="en">In the grass lay an empty fruit can, cast there by some former sojourner.Givens caught sight of it with a grunt of satisfaction.In his coat pocket tied behind his saddle was a handful or two of ground coffee.Black coffee and cigarettes!What ranchero could desire more?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >仅用两分钟，吉文斯便生起了一小堆火,篝火明快地燃烧着。他拿着罐头向水坑走去。走到离水坑边十五码远时，透过灌木丛，他看到左边不远处，有一匹装有女式马鞍的小马，耷拉着缰绳在啃草。约瑟法·奥唐奈刚从水坑边缘站了起来。她刚喝过水，拂了拂手掌上的沙子。吉文斯发现，在约瑟法右侧十码之外，一只墨西哥狮子正蹲伏在一丛荆棘中，半隐着身子。它那琥珀色的眼球闪着饥饿的光芒；眼睛后面六英尺处，尾尖笔直地伸着，如同一只猎犬。它晃动着后腿，这是猫科动物跳跃前的动作。</td>
		<td class="en">In two minutes he had a little fire going clearly.He started, with his can, for the water hole.When within fifteen yards of its edge he saw, between the bushes, a side-saddled pony with down-dropped reins cropping grass a little distance to his left.Just rising from her hands and knees on the brink of the water hole was Josefa O’Donnell.She had been drinking water, and she brushed the sand from the palms of her hands.Ten yards away, to her right, half concealed by a clump of sacuista, Givens saw the crouching form of the Mexican lion.His amber eyeballs glared hungrily; six feet from them was the tip of the tail stretched straight, like a pointer’s.His hind-quarters rocked with the motion of the cat tribe preliminary to leaping.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吉文斯尽力而为。当时，他的六发式左轮手枪在三十五码以外的草地上。他大喊一声，猛冲到狮子和公主之间。</td>
		<td class="en">Givens did what he could.His six-shooter was thirty-five yards away lying on the grass.He gave a loud yell, and dashed between the lion and the princess.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >吉文斯事后说，这场“骚动”虽然短暂，但却有点儿混乱。当他冲到那条战线上时，他看到空中划过一道模糊的影子，同时听到几声隐约的劈啪声。接着，一只百磅重的墨西哥狮子猛然间落在了他头上，随着一声刺耳的声音，他被压倒在地了。他记得当时自己喊道：“放开我，快点！——骗子，不公平！”然后像只虫子一样从狮子身子底下爬了出来，嘴里满是杂草和污泥，后脑勺撞在了水榆树根上，起了一个大肿包。狮子躺在那里一动不动。吉文斯愤愤不平，怀疑自己受了骗，他对着狮子晃了晃拳头，喊道：“我要跟你再战二十回合——”可紧接着便立即醒悟了过来。</td>
		<td class="en">The “rucus,” as Givens called it afterward, was brief and somewhat confused.When he arrived on the line of attack he saw a dim streak in the air, and heard a couple of faint cracks.Then a hundred pounds of Mexican lion plumped down upon his head and flattened him, with a heavy jar, to the ground.He remembered calling out: “Let up, now—no fair gouging!” and then he crawled from under the lion like a worm, with his mouth full of grass and dirt, and a big lump on the back of his head where it had struck the root of a water-elm.The lion lay motionless.Givens, feeling aggrieved, and suspicious of fouls, shook his fist at the lion, and shouted: “I’ll rastle you again for twenty—” and then he got back to himself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >约瑟法站在原处，平静地给那把银手柄的三八式手枪重装弹药。这种射击难度并不大。和在绳子上晃动着的番茄罐头相比，狮子的脑袋更容易做标靶。约瑟法的嘴角和黑色眼睛里流露出一种充满挑逗而令人发狂的笑意。这位救援未遂的骑士感到一股羞愧之火直烧他的灵魂。他原本是有机会的，他梦寐以求的机会；可是，莫摩斯却代替丘比特掌控了它。不用说，树林里的神灵们正欢快地捧腹暗笑着。这仿佛成了一出闹剧——吉文斯先生和填饱肚皮的狮子一起演出的杂耍闹剧。</td>
		<td class="en">Josefa was standing in her tracks, quietly reloading her silver-mounted .38.It had not been a difficult shot.The lion’s head made an easier mark than a tomato-can swinging at the end of a string.There was a provoking, teasing, maddening smile upon her mouth and in her dark eyes.The would-be-rescuing knight felt the fire of his fiasco burn down to his soul.Here had been his chance, the chance that he had dreamed of; and Momus, and not Cupid, had presided over it.The satyrs in the wood were, no doubt, holding their sides in hilarious, silent laughter.There had been something like vaudeville—say Signor Givens and his funny knockabout act with the stuffed lion.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是你吗，吉文斯先生？”约瑟法从容地问道，声调低沉却如糖似蜜，“你那一声叫喊害得我差点儿脱靶。你刚才跌到头了吗？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Is that you, Mr. Givens?” said Josefa, in her deliberate, saccharine contralto.“You nearly spoilt my shot when you yelled.Did you hurt your head when you fell?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哦，没有，”吉文斯平静地说着，“摔得不重。”他弯下腰，感到一阵羞耻，从这头狮子身下拽出了他那顶上等的斯泰森毡帽。帽子被压皱了，很富有喜剧效果。接着，他跪下来，轻轻地抚摸着那头死狮子凶神恶煞、张大嘴巴的脑袋。</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, no,” said Givens, quietly; “that didn’t hurt.”He stooped ignominiously and dragged his best Stetson hat from under the beast.It was crushed and wrinkled to a fine comedy effect.Then he knelt down and softly stroked the fierce, open-jawed head of the dead lion.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可怜的老比尔！”他悲痛地喊着。</td>
		<td class="en">“Poor old Bill!” he exclaimed mournfully.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“怎么回事？”约瑟法机警地问道。</td>
		<td class="en">“What’s that?” asked Josefa, sharply.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你当然不明白了，约瑟法小姐，”吉文斯说道，写在他脸上的，更多的是豁达，而非悲伤。“没有人会责怪你。我设法救它，但却没能及时让你知道。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Of course you didn’t know, Miss Josefa,” said Givens, with an air of one allowing magnanimity to triumph over grief.“Nobody can blame you.I tried to save him, but I couldn’t let you know in time.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“救谁？”</td>
		<td class="en">“Save who?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“唉，比尔呀。我找它整整一天了。要知道，两年来它一直是我们营地里的宠物。可怜的老伙计，它连一只棉尾野兔都不肯伤害的。营地里的兄弟们知道这件事后，一定会悲伤不已的。不过，当时你当然无法断定比尔是不是只想和你玩啊。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Why, Bill.I’ve been looking for him all day.You see, he’s been our camp pet for two years.Poor old fellow, he wouldn’t have hurt a cottontail rabbit.It’ll break the boys all up when they hear about it.But you couldn’t tell, of course, that Bill was just trying to play with you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >约瑟法那黑色的眼睛炯炯有神地盯着他。就这样，里普利·吉文斯顺利地度过了这一关。他一边站着，一边揉搓着他那黄褐色的卷发，神情忧郁，若有所思。他的眼里带着遗憾，以及些许自责。他那柔滑的面庞上流露出难以遮掩的哀伤。约瑟法踌躇着，有些困惑了。</td>
		<td class="en">Josefa’s black eyes burned steadily upon him.Ripley Givens met the test successfully.He stood rumpling the yellow-brown curls on his head pensively.In his eye was regret, not unmingled with a gentle reproach.His smooth features were set to a pattern of indisputable sorrow.Josefa wavered.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那你们的宠物在这儿干什么？”她不甘心地问了最后一句，“白马渡口附近又没有营地。”</td>
		<td class="en">“What was your pet doing here?” she asked, making a last stand.“There’s no camp near the White Horse Crossing.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“昨天，这个老顽童从营地里跑了出来。”吉文斯不加思索地答道，“那些丛林狼没吓死它可真是个奇迹。要知道，上周，我们的牧人吉姆·韦伯斯特给营地弄来了一只小猎犬。那只狗崽让比尔的生活陷入惨境——一连好几个小时追着比尔到处跑，还咬它的后腿。每晚睡觉的时候，比尔就会偷偷地躲到一个弟兄的毯子里休息，以防狗崽发现它。我估计它一定是愁苦不已、走投无路了，否则它也不会出走。它一直以来都害怕离开营地。”</td>
		<td class="en">“The old rascal ran away from camp yesterday,” answered Givens readily.“It’s a wonder the coyotes didn’t scare him to death.You see, Jim Webster, our horse wrangler, brought a little terrier pup into camp last week.The pup made life miserable for Bill—he used to chase him around and chew his hind legs for hours at a time.Every night when bedtime came Bill would sneak under one of the boy’s blankets and sleep to keep the pup from finding him.I reckon he must have been worried pretty desperate or he wouldn’t have run away.He was always afraid to get out of sight of camp.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >约瑟法看了看这头猛兽的尸体。吉文斯轻轻地拍了拍这狮子的一只爪子，这只爪子十分可怕，平时能在一击之下杀死一头小牛。这个姑娘深橄榄色的脸上逐渐泛起一片红晕。真正的猎手打到不光彩的猎物时，就会有这种羞愧的表示吗？她的双眼更加柔和，眼睑低垂，之前嘲弄的神情荡然无存了。</td>
		<td class="en">Josefa looked at the body of the fierce animal.Givens gently patted one of the formidable paws that could have killed a yearling calf with one blow.Slowly a red flush widened upon the dark olive face of the girl.Was it the signal of shame of the true sportsman who has brought down ignoble quarry?Her eyes grew softer, and the lowered lids drove away all their bright mockery.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我真的很替它难过，”她温顺地说道，“但是它看起来那么大，蹦得那么高，所以——”</td>
		<td class="en">“I’m very sorry,” she said humbly; “but he looked so big, and jumped so high that—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“可怜的老比尔饿了。”吉文斯打断她，立即为死者辩护道，“在营地里，我们总是叫它跳起来，才给它东西吃。它会为了一块肉在地上打滚儿。它见到你时，总以为你会给他一些吃的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Poor old Bill was hungry,” interrupted Givens, in quick defence of the deceased.“We always made him jump for his supper in camp.He would lie down and roll over for a piece of meat.When he saw you he thought he was going to get something to eat from you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >约瑟法猛地睁大了双眼。</td>
		<td class="en">Suddenly Josefa’s eyes opened wide.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我刚才差点儿打中你！”她大叫道，“当时你正好跑在中间。你竟然冒着性命危险来救你的宠物！你太好了，吉文斯先生！我喜欢善待动物的人。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I might have shot you!” she exclaimed.“You ran right in between.You risked your life to save your pet!That was fine, Mr. Givens.I like a man who is kind to animals.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >的确，她那凝视的双眸里甚至多了几分爱慕。毕竟，这片寥落的废墟上，一位英雄腾空而出。吉文斯单凭他脸上的神情，就可以在动物保护协会里谋得一个高职。</td>
		<td class="en">Yes; there was even admiration in her gaze now.After all, there was a hero rising out of the ruins of the anti-climax.The look on Givens’s face would have secured him a high position in the S.P.C.A.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我一向爱动物，”他说，“马呀，狗呀，墨西哥狮子呀，牛呀，鳄鱼呀——”</td>
		<td class="en">“I always loved ’em,” said he; “horses, dogs, Mexican lions, cows, alligators—”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我厌恶鳄鱼，”约瑟法立即反驳说，“这家伙满身泥巴，叫人毛骨悚然。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I hate alligators,” instantly demurred Josefa; “crawly, muddy things!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我有说过鳄鱼吗？”吉文斯说道，“我刚才指的是羚羊啦。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Did I say alligators?” said Givens.“I meant antelopes, of course.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >约瑟法有些愧疚，她决定补救自己的过失。她忏悔地伸出了手。她双眼里噙满了晶莹的泪水。</td>
		<td class="en">Josefa’s conscience drove her to make further amends.She held out her hand penitently.There was a bright, unshed drop in each of her eyes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“吉文斯先生，请你宽恕我，好吗？你也明白，我只是一个女孩子，我起先被吓着了。是我打死了比尔，我真的好难过。你不知道我是多么地羞愧！我要是知道情况，绝不会这么做的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Please forgive me, Mr. Givens, won’t you?I’m only a girl, you know, and I was frightened at first.I’m very, very sorry I shot Bill.You don’t know how ashamed I feel.I wouldn’t have done it for anything.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她伸出手来，吉文斯抓住了它。他握了一会儿，尽量让自己宽宏大量的天性去战胜丧失比尔的痛苦。最终，他显然原谅了她。</td>
		<td class="en">Givens took the proffered hand.He held it for a time while he allowed the generosity of his nature to overcome his grief at the loss of Bill.At last it was clear that he had forgiven her.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“请不要再提那件事了，约瑟法小姐。比尔的样子足以吓倒任何一个年轻姑娘。我会给兄弟们解释清楚这件事的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Please don’t speak of it any more, Miss Josefa.’Twas enough to frighten any young lady the way Bill looked.I’ll explain it all right to the boys.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你真的不恨我了吗？”在情感的驱动下，约瑟法跟他靠得更近了。她的眼睛很迷人——哦，迷人和恳求中带着仁慈的忏悔。“要是有人杀了我的小猫咪，无论是谁我都会恨死他呢。你是多么勇敢和善良啊，会冒着被击中的危险来竭力救比尔！能那么做的人太少了！”从失败中夺得了胜利！闹剧变成了正剧！里普利·吉文斯真了不起！</td>
		<td class="en">“Are you really sure you don’t hate me?”Josefa came closer to him impulsively.Her eyes were sweet—oh, sweet and pleading with gracious penitence.“I would hate anyone who would kill my kitten.And how daring and kind of you to risk being shot when you tried to save him!How very few men would have done that!”Victory wrested from defeat!Vaudeville turned into drama!Bravo, Ripley Givens!</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >天已经黑了。吉文斯当然不会让约瑟法小姐一个人骑马回家。他不顾小马责备的眼神，重新装好了马鞍，陪她一起回去。一位是公主，一位是善待动物之人，他们肩并肩疾驰过这片平坦的草地。大草原上散发着富饶的泥土气息，浓郁美妙的花香将他们围绕。丛林狼在远处山岗上尖叫。没什么害怕的。可是——</td>
		<td class="en">It was now twilight.Of course Miss Josefa could not be allowed to ride on to the ranch-house alone.Givens resaddled his pony in spite of that animal’s reproachful glances, and rode with her.Side by side they galloped across the smooth grass, the princess and the man who was kind to animals.The prairie odours of fruitful earth and delicate bloom were thick and sweet around them.Coyotes yelping over there on the hill!No fear.And yet—</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >约瑟法骑得更近了。然后，有一只小手似乎在摸索着什么。吉文斯用自己的手找到了这只小手。两匹小马齐步并进着。这两只手挽在一起，一只手的主人解释说：</td>
