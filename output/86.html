		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我怎么都想不明白汤姆·霍普金斯怎会犯了这么个大错，要知道在继承他姑妈的遗产之前，他学了整整一学期的医——况且还曾被认为擅长治疗学。</td>
		<td class="en">I never could quite understand how Tom Hopkins came to make that blunder, for he had been through a whole term at a medical college—before he inherited his aunt’s fortune—and had been considered strong in therapeutics.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那晚，我们一同看望了一个朋友，之后，他到我的房间抽了会儿烟，闲聊了一阵，然后就准备回他的豪华公寓了。我走进另一间屋子不一会儿，就听见汤姆叫我：</td>
		<td class="en">We had been making a call together that evening, and afterward Tom ran up to my rooms for a pipe and a chat before going on to his own luxurious apartments.I had stepped into the other room for a moment when I heard Tom sing out:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嗨，比利，我全身觉得有点儿不舒服，有点儿发冷，要是你不介意的话，我想吃大约四格令的奎宁。我好像感冒了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Oh, Billy, I’m going to take about four grains of quinine, if you don’t mind—I’m feeling all blue and shivery.Guess I’m taking cold.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“吃吧。”我回答他，“在第二层架子上的那瓶就是。用一勺桉树油酏剂调好再吃。能去掉奎宁的苦味。”</td>
		<td class="en">“All right,” I called back.“The bottle is on the second shelf.Take it in a spoonful of that elixir of eucalyptus.It knocks the bitter out.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我回来后，我们就坐在火炉边，继续抽着石南烟。大概过了八分钟，汤姆慢慢地瘫倒了。</td>
		<td class="en">After I came back we sat by the fire and got our briars going.In about eight minutes Tom sank back into a gentle collapse.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我径直走向药箱一看究竟。</td>
		<td class="en">I went straight to the medicine cabinet and looked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“你真是十足的蠢材！”我吼道。“看看，金钱是怎样冲昏一个人的大脑的！”</td>
		<td class="en">“You unmitigated hayseed!”I growled.“See what money will do for a man’s brains!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >那个装吗啡的瓶子就那样放着，汤姆吃完也没有盖上它。</td>
		<td class="en">There stood the morphine bottle with the stopple out, just as Tom had left it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我打发住在楼上的那个年轻医师去请住在两个街区外的盖尔斯老医生来帮忙。汤姆·霍普金斯这有钱的主不能让初出茅庐的年轻医师一个人来治疗。</td>
		<td class="en">I routed out another young MD who roomed on the floor above, and sent him for old Doctor Gales, two squares away.Tom Hopkins has too much money to be attended by rising young practitioners alone.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在盖尔斯老先生来了之后，我们在医疗条件允许的情况下，对汤姆进行了一整套费用昂贵的治疗。给他吃了点儿强效药之后，我们又频繁地给他服用柠檬酸咖啡因，灌浓咖啡，然后架着他楼上楼下地走来走去。盖尔斯老先生使劲地掐他，甩他几个大耳刮子，为即将到手的高额诊金卖足了力气。住在楼上的年轻医师用尽全力，狠狠地给了汤姆一脚，给他醒醒脑，然后向我道歉。</td>
		<td class="en">When Gales came we put Tom through as expensive a course of treatment as the resources of the profession permit.After the more drastic remedies we gave him citrate of caffeine in frequent doses and strong coffee, and walked him up and down the floor between two of us.Old Gales pinched him and slapped his face and worked hard for the big check he could see in the distance.The young MD from the next floor gave Tom a most hearty, rousing kick, and then apologized to me.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“实在没忍住。”他说，“我这辈子还没踢过百万富翁。我可能再也没有下次机会了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Couldn’t help it,” he said.“I never kicked a millionaire before in my life.I may never have another opportunity.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >几个小时后，盖尔斯说：“好了，他没事了。但是你们还得在一个小时之内让他保持清醒。比如和他说说话，时不时地推推他。等到他呼吸和脉搏都正常了，再让他睡。现在我把他交给你们了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Now,” said Doctor Gales, after a couple of hours, “he’ll do.But keep him awake for another hour.You can do that by talking to him and shaking him up occasionally.When his pulse and respiration are normal then let him sleep.I’ll leave him with you now.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我们把汤姆架到沙发上，留下我一个人照看他。他很安静地躺在那里，眼睛半睁半闭着。我开始着手让他保持清醒。</td>
		<td class="en">I was left alone with Tom, whom we had laid on a couch.He lay very still, and his eyes were half closed.I began my work of keeping him awake.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“嘿，老伙计，”我说，“你差点儿就没命了，好在我们把你救了回来。汤姆，你上课的时候，难道没有听过任何一个教授偶然提起——吗啡和奎宁不是同一种东西，特别是足有四格令剂量的时候？在你能站起来之前，我也就不啰嗦了。你本可以成为一名药剂师的，汤姆，完全有资格开药方的。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Well, old man,” I said, “you’ve had a narrow squeak, but we’ve pulled you through.When you were attending lectures, Tom, didn’t any of the professors ever casually remark that m-o-r-p-h-i-a never spells ‘quinia,’ especially in four-grain doses?But I won’t pile it up on you until you get on your feet.But you ought to have been a druggist, Tom; you’re splendidly qualified to fill prescriptions.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >汤姆看着我，带着一抹傻傻的微笑。</td>
		<td class="en">Tom looked at me with a faint and foolish smile.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“比——比莱，”他喃喃地说着，“我感觉我像是灰（飞）在很多名贵玫瑰发（花）丛里的一只轰（蜂）鸟。你别烦我。我要睡觉了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“B’ly,” he murmured, “I feel jus’ like a hum’n bird flyin’ around a jolly lot of most ‘shpensive roses.Don’ bozzer me.Goin’ sleep now.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >才两秒钟，他就睡着了。我抓着他的肩膀摇晃他。</td>
		<td class="en">And he went to sleep in two seconds.I shook him by the shoulder.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“哎，汤姆，”我厉声喊道，“这不行。医生大人说你在至少一小时之内还得保持清醒。快睁开眼睛。你知道，你还没完全脱离危险。快醒醒。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Now, Tom,” I said, severely, “this won’t do.The big doctor said you must stay awake for at least an hour.Open your eyes.You’re not entirely safe yet, you know.Wake up.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >汤姆·霍普金斯有一百九十八磅重。他迷迷糊糊地对着我咧嘴笑了一下，又沉沉地睡着了。要我拖着他在房间里走动，就好比抱着古埃及克娄巴特拉方尖碑跳华尔兹。汤姆开始打起了呼噜，对于一个吗啡中毒的人来说，这是个危险的征兆。</td>
		<td class="en">Tom Hopkins weighs one hundred and ninety-eight.He gave me another somnolent grin, and fell into deeper slumber.I would have made him move about, but I might as well have tried to make Cleopatra’s Needle waltz around the room with me.Tom’s breathing became stertorous, and that, in connection with morphia poisoning, means danger.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这时，我开始思考。我没法唤醒他的身体，那我就必须让他的思想兴奋起来。“让他发怒。”我脑海中灵光一现。“好主意！”我想，但是该怎么办呢？汤姆是个无懈可击的人。亲爱的老伙计。他是个天性善良的人，也是个殷勤的绅士，像阳光般美好、真实、干净。他来自依旧心怀理想、注重礼节的南方某地。纽约让他陶醉，却没有使他放纵。他对待女士还是老式的骑士风度和尊重——啊！——有办法了！我在脑海里就这个计划想了大概一到两分钟。一想到用那样的办法来刺激老汤姆·霍普金斯，我自己也忍俊不禁。于是我抓着他的肩膀用力晃他，晃得他耳朵都抖了起来。他懒洋洋地睁开眼睛。我装出一脸鄙夷和谴责的样子看着他，用手指着离他鼻子还不到两英寸的地方。</td>
		<td class="en">Then I began to think.I could not rouse his body; I must strive to excite his mind.“Make him angry,” was an idea that suggested itself.“Good!”I thought; but how?There was not a joint in Tom’s armour.Dear old fellow!He was good nature itself, and a gallant gentleman, fine and true and clean as sunlight.He came from somewhere down South, where they still have ideals and a code.New York had charmed, but had not spoiled, him.He had that old-fashioned chivalrous reverence for women, that—Eureka!—there was my idea!I worked the thing up for a minute or two in my imagination.I chuckled to myself at the thought of springing a thing like that on old Tom Hopkins.Then I took him by the shoulder and shook him till his ears flopped.He opened his eyes lazily.I assumed an expression of scorn and contempt, and pointed my finger within two inches of his nose.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“听我说，霍普金斯，”我用明显尖酸刻薄的语气说道，“我们曾经是好朋友，但是我要你明白，在今后，任何行为像你这样一个恶棍的人，我的大门不会向他打开。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Listen to me, Hopkins,” I said, in cutting and distinct tones, “you and I have been good friends, but I want you to understand that in the future my doors are closed against any man who acts as much like a scoundrel as you have.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他看起来似乎一点儿兴趣也提不起来。</td>
		<td class="en">Tom looked the least bit interested.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“怎么了，比利？”他镇定地喃喃问道，“衣服不合身么？”</td>
		<td class="en">“What’s the matter, Billy?” he muttered, composedly.“Don’t your clothes fit you?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“要是我是你，”我继续说道，“谢天谢地，幸亏不是，我可不敢闭上眼睛。还记得那个被你抛弃在南方孤寂松树间的姑娘吗——自从你得了那些臭钱就把她抛诸脑后——你让她怎么办？哎，我知道我在说什么。当时你还是医学院里一个穷学生，她完全配得上你。但如今，自从你成了百万富翁，情况可就不一样了。我在想，当她见到你们这类特殊群体——她从小被教育要爱戴的南方绅士的所作所为之后，会有怎样的看法？对不起，霍普金斯，我不得不把这些事说出来，但是你掩饰的那么好，做的那么自然，几乎让我发誓不相信是你做了这些算不得男人的勾当。”</td>
		<td class="en">“If I were in your place,” I went on, “which, thank God, I am not, I think I would be afraid to close my eyes.How about that girl you left waiting for you down among those lonesome Southern pines—the girl that you’ve forgotten since you came into your confounded money?Oh, I know what I’m talking about.While you were a poor medical student she was good enough for you.But now, since you are a millionaire, it’s different.I wonder what she thinks of the performances of that peculiar class of people which she has been taught to worship—the Southern gentlemen?I’m sorry, Hopkins, that I was forced to speak about these matters, but you’ve covered it up so well and played your part so nicely that I would have sworn you were above such unmanly tricks.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可怜的汤姆。看着他和镇静剂奋力抗争的样子，我几乎忍不住要笑出声来。他显然怒火中烧，我也怪不得他。汤姆有着南方人的脾气。他现在睁开了眼，眼中冒着一丝怒火。但是药剂还是让他意识模糊，舌头打结。</td>
		<td class="en">Poor Tom.I could scarcely keep from laughing outright to see him struggling against the effects of the opiate.He was distinctly angry, and I didn’t blame him.Tom had a Southern temper.His eyes were open now, and they showed a gleam or two of fire.But the drug still clouded his mind and bound his tongue.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“去——去——去你的，”他结结巴巴地说，“我要宰——宰了你。”</td>
		<td class="en">“C-c-confound you,” he stammered, “I’ll s-smash you.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他挣扎着从沙发上爬起来。他虽然身材魁梧，但是现在十分虚弱。我用一只手就把他按了回去。他躺在那里，像掉进陷阱里的狮子一样干瞪着眼。</td>
		<td class="en">He tried to rise from the couch.With all his size he was very weak now.I thrust him back with one arm.He lay there glaring like a lion in a trap.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“这是为了让你再撑一会儿，老傻瓜。”我暗暗想道。我站起来，点了支烟来解解乏。我在房间里四处走动，为自己的妙计自得。</td>
		<td class="en">“That will hold you for a while, you old loony,” I said to myself.I got up and lit my pipe, for I was needing a smoke.I walked around a bit, congratulating myself on my brilliant idea.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我听见了鼾声。四下寻找声源。却发现汤姆又睡着了。我冲过去，冲着他的下巴就是一拳。他用一副快活，毫无怨言的表情，傻呵呵地看着我。我紧咬烟斗，开始痛骂他。</td>
		<td class="en">I heard a snore.I looked around.Tom was asleep again.I walked over and punched him on the jaw.He looked at me as pleasant and ungrudging as an idiot.I chewed my pipe and gave it to him hard.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我希望你赶紧清醒过来，然后从我房里滚蛋！”我侮辱他说。“我也把我对你的看法告诉你了。你如果还有廉耻或诚实的话，在你打算和绅士们交往的时候就该好好考虑一下。她是个可怜的姑娘，不是么？”我冷笑着说。“我们有了钱，她就变得那么的普通，那么的不时髦了。和她走在第五大街上就会让你觉得丢脸了，不是吗？霍普金斯，你比二流子还恶心四十七倍。谁在乎你的钱？我可不在乎。我敢打赌，那姑娘也不在乎。你要是没有这几个钱，或许会更像个男人。就为了那点儿钱，你变成了一个坏蛋，而且”——我认为那很有戏剧效果——“也许你伤了一颗真挚的心。”（汤姆·霍普金斯这老家伙居然伤了一颗真挚的心！）“你赶紧从我眼前滚开，越快越好。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I want you to recover yourself and get out of my rooms as soon as you can,” I said, insultingly.“I’ve told you what I think of you.If you have any honour or honesty left you will think twice before you attempt again to associate with gentlemen.She’s a poor girl, isn’t she?”I sneered.“Somewhat too plain and unfashionable for us since we got our money.Be ashamed to walk on Fifth Avenue with her, wouldn’t you?Hopkins, you’re forty-seven times worse than a cad.Who cares for your money?I don’t.I’ll bet that girl don’t.Perhaps if you didn’t have it you’d be more of a man.As it is you’ve made a cur of yourself, and”—I thought that quite dramatic—“perhaps broken a faithful heart.”(Old Tom Hopkins breaking a faithful heart!)“Let me be rid of you as soon as possible.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我转身背对着他，对着镜子冲自己眨了眨眼。背后传来他翻身的动静，我赶忙转身。我可不想这一百九十八磅的家伙从背后扑倒我。但他只是侧了侧身，用一只胳膊掩住了脸。他说了几句话，比刚才清楚了点儿。</td>
		<td class="en">I turned my back on Tom, and winked at myself in a mirror.I heard him moving, and I turned again quickly.I didn’t want a hundred and ninety-eight pounds falling on me from the rear.But Tom had only turned partly over, and laid one arm across his face.He spoke a few words rather more distinctly than before.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“比利，就算我听过别人对你的诋——诋毁，我也不会这样侮——侮辱你。但等我站得起来的时候—我要把你的头拧下来—给我记住了。”</td>
		<td class="en">“I couldn’t have—talked this way—to you, Billy, even if I’d heard people—lyin’ ’bout you.But jus’ soon’s I can s-stand up—I’ll break your neck—don’ f’get it.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我内心着实感到一丝内疚。到了天亮，等我把这件事和他解释一遍，我们可得乐上一阵了。</td>
		<td class="en">I did feel a little ashamed then.But it was to save Tom.In the morning, when I explained it, we would have a good laugh over it together.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >二十分钟左右，汤姆很快酣睡过去了。我给他把了把脉，听了听呼吸，就没再去把他弄醒。万事大吉，汤姆脱离危险了。我也到另一间房间，上床睡觉。</td>
		<td class="en">In about twenty minutes Tom dropped into a sound, easy slumber.I felt his pulse, listened to his respiration, and let him sleep.Everything was normal, and Tom was safe.I went into the other room and tumbled into bed.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二天一早，等我醒来时，发现汤姆已经穿好衣服起床了。除了有点儿打颤，舌头不利索之外，他已经完全恢复健康了。</td>
		<td class="en">I found Tom up and dressed when I awoke the next morning.He was entirely himself again with the exception of shaky nerves and a tongue like a white-oak chip.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“我可真没脑子，”他若有所思地说。“我记得喝奎宁的时候就觉得那瓶子有点儿不对劲。昨晚抢救我费了不少功夫吧？”</td>
		<td class="en">“What an idiot I was,” he said, thoughtfully.“I remember thinking that quinine bottle looked queer while I was taking the dose.Have much trouble in bringing me ’round?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我告诉他并没费多大劲。他对整件事的记忆似乎还不是很清楚。我想他应该不记得我为了让他保持清醒所做的努力，而且我也不打算告诉他。我想，等过几天他痊愈之后再告诉他，这样我们之间又有笑话可讲了。</td>
		<td class="en">I told him no.His memory seemed bad about the entire affair.I concluded that he had no recollection of my efforts to keep him awake, and decided not to enlighten him.Some other time, I thought, when he was feeling better, we would have some fun over it.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >汤姆准备走了，刚拉开门，他又停下，转身和我握了握手。</td>
		<td class="en">When Tom was ready to go he stopped, with the door open, and shook my hand.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“感激不尽，老伙计，”他平静地说，“多谢昨晚你费心照顾我，也感谢你昨晚那番话。我这会儿就去给那个小姑娘打电报。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Much obliged, old fellow,” he said, quietly, “for taking so much trouble with me—and for what you said.I’m going down now to telegraph to the little girl.”</td></tr>
