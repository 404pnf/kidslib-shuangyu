		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >整个这片地区具有一种几乎宗教色彩的宏伟气氛，同时却又散发着一种莫名的凄凉感，令人惊叹。</td>
		<td class="en">This entire stretch of country was amazing; it was characterized by a grandeur that was almost religious, and yet it had an air of sinister desolation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >光秃秃的山丘中间有一个荒芜的大湖，湖中满是污浊的死水，密密麻麻的芦苇随风飘摇。山丘中间只长着一大圈的金雀花，偶有一棵被风吹得扭曲变形的橡树夹杂在其中。</td>
		<td class="en">A great, wild lake, filled with stagnant, black water, in which thousands of reeds were waving to and fro, lay in the midst of a vast circle of naked hills, where nothing grew but broom, or here and there an oak curiously twisted by the wind.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在这阴暗的湖畔，只有一所低矮的小房子，里面住着一个以捕鱼为生的老船夫——约瑟夫叔叔。</td>
		<td class="en">Just one house stood on the banks of that dark lake, a small, low house inhabited by Uncle Joseph, an old boatman, who lived on what he could make by his fishing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他每星期把捕的鱼送到附近的村子里，然后带回来少量基本的生活必需品。</td>
		<td class="en">Once a week he carried the fish he caught into the surrounding villages, returning with the few provisions that he needed for his sustenance.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我去看望这位孤独的老人时，他邀请我和他一起去收取渔网，我便答应了。</td>
		<td class="en">I went to see this old hermit, who offered to take me with him to his nets, and I accepted.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他的船又旧又粗陋，甚至被虫蛀蚀了；而这位瘦削的老人，用单调而柔和的动作划着桨，他的动作抚慰着我的心灵，那已被附近这片土地的凄凉压抑的心灵。</td>
		<td class="en">His boat was old, worm-eaten and clumsy, and the skinny old man rowed with a gentle and monotonous stroke that was soothing to the soul, already oppressed by the sadness of the land round about.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我仿佛穿越到了远古时代，乘着那艘被另一个时期的人驾驶的原始船，来到了这个古老地区的中部。</td>
		<td class="en">It seemed to me as if I were transported to olden times, in the midst of that ancient country, in that primitive boat, which was propelled by a man of another age.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他收起渔网，把鱼扔在船板上，正如《圣经》中的渔夫会做的那样。</td>
		<td class="en">He took up his nets and threw the fish into the bottom of the boat, as the fishermen of the Bible might have done.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >随后，他把我一直带到湖的尽头，突然，我发现湖畔对面有一片废墟，那是一间破茅屋，墙上有一个巨大的红色十字架。在落日的余晖下发着微光，十字架就像是用鲜血涂上去的一样。</td>
		<td class="en">Then he took me down to the end of the lake, where I suddenly perceived a ruin on the other side of the bank a dilapidated hut, with an enormous red cross on the wall that looked as if it might have been traced with blood, as it gleamed in the last rays of the setting sun.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那是什么？”我问。</td>
		<td class="en">“What is that?” I asked.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >”那是犹大死的地方。“他说着，在胸前画了个十字。</td>
		<td class="en">“That is where Judas died,” the man replied, crossing himself.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我并不感到吃惊，因为我几乎料到会是这样奇怪的回答。</td>
		<td class="en">I was not surprised, being almost prepared for this strange answer.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不过，我还是接着问：</td>
		<td class="en">Still I asked:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“犹大？</td>
		<td class="en">“Judas?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >哪个犹大？”</td>
		<td class="en">What Judas?”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“那个永世流浪的犹太人，先生。”他补充道。</td>
		<td class="en">“The Wandering Jew, monsieur,” he added.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >我请他给我讲讲这个传说。</td>
		<td class="en">I asked him to tell me this legend.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但它比传说更有意思，是一个真实的故事，而且就是最近发生的故事，因为约瑟夫叔叔认识这个人。</td>
		<td class="en">But it was better than a legend, being a true story, and quite a recent one, since Uncle Joseph had known the man.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >以前，这间茅屋住着一个高大的女人，她靠人们的施舍为生，就跟乞丐一样。</td>
		<td class="en">This hut had formerly been occupied by a large woman, a kind of beggar, who lived on public charity.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她是从谁那里得到这间茅屋的，约瑟夫叔叔已经不记得了。一天晚上，一个白胡子老人，看上去已有两百岁，几乎连路也走不动了，在经过这个贫苦女人的住所时，向她乞讨。</td>
		<td class="en">Uncle Joseph did not remember from whom she had this hut. One evening an old man with a white beard, who seemed to be at least two hundred years old, and who could hardly drag himself along, asked alms of this forlorn woman, as he passed her dwelling.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“请坐，老爹，”她回答说，“这里的每样东西都是属于大家的，因为它取之于大家。”</td>
		<td class="en">“Sit down, father,” she replied; “everything here belongs to all the world, since it comes from all the world.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他在门前的一块石头上坐了下来。</td>
		<td class="en">He sat down on a stone before the door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他和这个女人分享她的面包、用树叶铺的床和她的茅屋。</td>
		<td class="en">He shared the woman’s bread, her bed of leaves, and her house.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >从此，他不再离开她，他的流浪生活已经结束了。</td>
		<td class="en">He did not leave her again, for he had come to the end of his travels.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >“是我们的童贞圣母允许这么做的，先生，”约瑟夫补充说，“因为是一个女人曾为犹大打开了她的家门，因为这个老流浪汉是永世流浪的犹太人。</td>
		<td class="en">“It was Our Lady the Virgin who permitted this, monsieur,” Joseph added, “it being a woman who had opened her door to a Judas, for this old vagabond was the Wandering Jew.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >起初，当地的人们并不知道这一点，但人们很快就猜到了，因为他老是不停地走路；这已经成为他的习惯了。”</td>
		<td class="en">It was not known at first in the country, but the people suspected it very soon, because he was always walking; it had become a sort of second nature to him.”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >引起怀疑还另有原因。</td>
		<td class="en">And suspicion had been aroused by still another thing.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这个收留陌生人的女人被人们看作犹太人，因为从来没有人见她进过教堂。</td>
		<td class="en">This woman, who kept that stranger with her, was thought to be a Jewess, for no one had ever seen her at church.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >在方圆十英里内，人们都只叫她“犹太女人”。</td>
		<td class="en">For ten miles around no one ever called her anything else but the Jewess.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当地的小孩见她来乞讨时，都大叫：“妈妈，妈妈，犹太女人来了！”</td>
		<td class="en">When the little country children saw her come to beg they cried out: “Mamma, mamma, here is the Jewess!”</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >老人和她便开始一同去附近的地区，挨家挨户地乞讨，怯声怯气地向过往行人哀告。</td>
		<td class="en">The old man and she began to go out together into the neighboring districts, holding out their hands at all the doors, stammering supplications into the ears of all the passers.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >白天任何时候都可以看到他们行走在村子旁边的小路上，或者忍受着中午的高温，坐在一棵孤零零的大树的树阴下吃面包。</td>
		<td class="en">They could be seen at all hours of the day, on by-paths, in the villages, or again eating bread, sitting in the noon heat under the shadow of some solitary tree.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >于是，当地的人们开始把这个乞丐叫做“犹大老爹”。</td>
		<td class="en">And the country people began to call the beggar Old Judas.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天，他用袋子背回两头活生生的小猪，那是一个农场主给他的，因为他治愈了该农场主的疾病。</td>
		<td class="en">One day he brought home in his sack two little live pigs, which a farmer had given him after he had cured the farmer of some sickness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >不久，他便停止乞讨，专心照料他的猪。</td>
		<td class="en">Soon he stopped begging, and devoted himself entirely to his pigs.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他把它们带到湖边，或稀疏的橡树林下，或附近的山谷中觅食。</td>
		<td class="en">He took them out to feed by the lake, or under isolated oaks, or in the near-by valleys.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >而那个女人则整天到处乞讨，不过到了晚上，她还是回去和他呆在一起。</td>
		<td class="en">The woman, however, went about all day begging, but she always came back to him in the evening.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他也从来不去教堂，大家也从来没有见过他在路边的耶稣受难像前画过十字。</td>
		<td class="en">He also did not go to church, and no one ever had seen him cross himself before the wayside crucifixes.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >这些事情引起了很多闲言碎语：</td>
		<td class="en">All this gave rise to much gossip:</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >一天夜里，他的女伴突然发高烧，并开始浑身发抖，哆嗦得像风中的叶子。</td>
		<td class="en">One night his companion was attacked by a fever and began to tremble like a leaf in the wind.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他到离这里最近的镇上去买了一些药物，然后把自己和她一起关在屋内，连续六天，人们都没见过他。</td>
		<td class="en">He went to the nearest town to get some medicine, and then he shut himself up with her, and was not seen for six days.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >当神父听说“犹太女人”将不久于人世后，他就打算给予她教会的慰藉，为她办临终圣事。</td>
		<td class="en">The priest, having heard that the “Jewess” was about to die, came to offer the consolation of his religion and administer the last sacrament.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >她到底是不是犹太人呢？</td>
		<td class="en">Was she a Jewess?</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他无从得知。</td>
		<td class="en">He did not know.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是无论如何，他想试着拯救她的灵魂。</td>
		<td class="en">But in any case, he wished to try to save her soul.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他刚一敲门，犹大老爹就出现在门口；他气喘吁吁，两眼冒火，一撮长胡子抖动得像在流动的水。他用某种他人听不懂的语言大声辱骂神父，还伸开瘦长的双臂拦住他，不让他进去。</td>
		<td class="en">Hardly had he knocked at the door when old Judas appeared on the threshold, breathing hard, his eyes aflame, his long beard agitated, like rippling water, and he hurled blasphemies in an unknown language, extending his skinny arms in order to prevent the priest from entering.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >神父试图开口说话，提供资金和帮助，但这个老头仍在不停地咒骂，做着手势要向他扔石头。</td>
		<td class="en">The priest attempted to speak, offered his purse and his aid, but the old man kept on abusing him, making gestures with his hands as if throwing; stones at him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >之后神父走了，老乞丐还在他背后骂不绝口。</td>
		<td class="en">Then the priest retired, followed by the curses of the beggar.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >第二天，犹大老爹的女伴死了。</td>
		<td class="en">The companion of old Judas died the following day.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他亲自把她埋在门前。</td>
		<td class="en">He buried her himself, in front of her door.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >他们太微不足道，没有人关注他们。</td>
		<td class="en">They were people of so little account that no one took any interest in them.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >随后，人们又在湖边、小山坡上看到过他，赶着他的猪。</td>
		<td class="en">Then they saw the man take his pigs out again to the lake and up the hillsides.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >为了填饱肚子，他也重新开始乞讨。</td>
		<td class="en">And he also began begging again to get food.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >可是人们几乎不再给他东西，因为关于他的闲言碎语实在太多了。</td>
		<td class="en">But the people gave him hardly anything, as there was so much gossip about him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >况且，每个人都知道他是怎样对待神父的。</td>

		<td class="en">That was during Holy Week, but no one paid any attention to him.</td></tr>
		<tr><td width="45%" class="zh" >但是复活节那天，一群到湖边散步的小伙子和姑娘听见茅屋里发出一声巨响。茅屋的门是锁着的；小伙子们把门一撞开，就有两头猪像山羊一样跳着出来，逃跑了。</td>
		<td class="en">But on Easter Sunday the boys and girls who had gone walking out to the lake heard a great noise in the hut. The door was locked; but the boys broke it in, and the two pigs ran out, jumping like goats.</td></tr>
